 a fun and simple way to challenge your friends to a photo contest on your iphone! watch a walkthrough of duelpic the story: one day we were at our grandparents house looking for a way to entertain ourselves. being avid mobile photographers, we thought it would be fun to see who could take the best photo of the same category and which photo would get the most 'likes' on instagram. since braydon had the most followers on instagram, his photo easily won. we thought a great app idea would be one that allowed you to have a photo contest with friends and the winner be determined on the quality of the image alone, not how many followers someone has. that's how we came up with the idea for duelpic. since then we have been building out and designing the idea and now are seeking funding to complete our initial vision because we think other people would enjoy this application as well.‚ what: we want to create an application where users can challenge their friends to a photo contest and a winner be chosen by other users of the application voting for their favorite photo.‚ collect badges, earn achievements and climb the ranks as you compete with others for photography dominance! how: we have brought on some very creative and talented people to help turn this project into a reality.‚ included as one of our reward options is a custom painting from the multi-talented laura lawson (check her out here: www.lauralawsonart.com ) who is also helping us promote duelpic. in addition to outreach coordination we have assembled a team of talented programmers for the application development as well as the server-side back end of the application. how the funds will be used: - hire experienced iphone developer - hire experienced server developer - server costs - app store developer fees - equipment - caffeinated beverages for us and the developers to keep us awake while we work away building this app! project status: we have carefully designed every screen of the application as well as built out every userflow. we also have built a community of users interested in the application on our instagram and twitter accounts.‚ any funds we receive above our goal will go towards creating a version of the application where companies can sponsor photo contest using the application and users can win awesome prizes using their photos! about us: we are brothers who enjoy mobile photography and creating applications that add to that experience. faq 
 did you miss the fritz kickstarter? you can buy fritz at www.xyzbot.com/store.php fritz is a robotic head, with moving eyes and jaw, but also (in the advanced version available) eyelids, eyebrows, lips and moving neck. ‚ fritz is great fun, but also a great educational tool. ‚ update: stretch goal added. $42k and we will...‚ 1) include a sonar sensor with every $70 and higher reward. and we will include software to allow fritz to run in standalone mode, no pc. ‚ so he will react when the sonar sensor triggers. for halloween, you could set up fritz to start talking when people walk in front of him. 2) tweet reader - we will add software to have fritz read your tweets to you as they come in. you just connect to twitter using the fritz app, and he'll read it to you. fritz says thanks for helping him to reach the $35k stretch goal in this video. ‚ this is a white acrylic fritz, and really needs the sun, so thanks a lot for helping us hit $35k. this video was made with an actual fritz, using the fritz app. here is an mdf fritz video a week ago, asking for help on the stretch goal. with our $35k funding we have added "behaviors" for fritz, taking input from things like a webcam or sensors and react to them. ‚ first behavior: he will be able to detect a face using your existing webcam and then "wake up" and greet you with "good morning". ‚ or to tell you the local temperature, or the temperature in rome or wherever you'd rather be. so, the app will include ability to get input from sensors, and to read headline from yahoo news and say it to you. ‚ over time, we will add other scripted behaviors that you can download. who can use fritz? for kids, fritz is a great project to start with robotics and animatronics. ‚ and once he is built, they can continue to learn and have fun by customizing him, adding features, making a movie starring fritz, etc. ‚ fritz can even be a way to study the psychology of human expression and emotion. for those that just want to have fun with a robot head, fritz is ready for duty. ‚ you can use fritz to build a display for halloween. ‚ fritz can talk to trick-or-treaters, or scare them into dropping those pillowcases and collect the loot for yourself. for more experienced users, fritz is a good way to break into human emotion mimicry robotics. ‚ the computer software and the arduino firmware will be open source and can be modified. basic and advanced models fritz is offered in two versions: ‚ basic and advanced. ‚ basic fritz has moveable eyes, and jaw. ‚ the basic model is less expensive and easier to build. ‚ advanced fritz has greater range of expression, adding eyelids, eyebrows, lips and moveable neck. i'm not a robotics expert. ‚ will i be able to build and use fritz? fritz was designed to be easy to assemble. ‚ no robotics experience required. ‚ fritz is recommended for ages 12 and above. tools needed are a small phillips head screwdriver, needle-nose pliers, and glue. ‚ we recommend hot glue or gorilla glue. ‚ budget about 2 hours to build basic fritz and 3 hours for advanced fritz. using fritz is easy once he is assembled. ‚ the control application helps you to get him set up, then you just start having fun, clicking on features and playing around. ‚ you can connect a joystick and control him that way rather than using the app and a mouse and keyboard. ‚ the open source software makes it easy to update and modify if you want to, but no arduino, or electronics, or programming experience is needed. what about the control app?‚ ‚ xyzbot has created a windows application that allows you to control fritz with your mouse, or keystrokes, or even a joystick or game controller.‚ ‚ the app has a picture of fritz's face. when you move your mouse over his face, green control dots will appear. for example, click on an eye and you will see red arrows appear (see photo above) that show which direction the eye can be moved. you just click and drag to move that part. or you can click on a pre-generated "expression" like happy, sad, disappointed, etc.‚ the fritz face in the app will show that expression and robot fritz will move his features at the same time.‚ you can record a sequence of actions and play them back. with his text to speech feature , you can type in text and fritz will "speak", moving his jaw and lips in sync. you can also use a joystick for a "live" feel. if you want to use fritz as a puppet or ventriloquist dummy, this is probably the best option since you can can get very complex behavior very quickly. more about behaviors and roborealm what if fritz could "see" you sit at your desk in the morning and say hello and tell you the temperature outside, or a news headline, or insult you if you like to start the day that way. ‚ our stretch goal for $35,000 will make this possible. ‚ we will include 2 behaviors called "webcam detect and greet", and "tell me temperature". ‚ over time we will add more behaviors which you can download, like apps for you smart phone. this is done using the program roborealm which will be bundled with fritz kits if we hit $35k . ‚ roborealm will give you the ability to script your own behaviors like have fritz read headlines from your favorite news feed, or stock quotes. ‚ you will be able to write scripts yourself, or download from our site and have them just run using the fritz app without ever opening roborealm or any other program. ‚ for those that are technologically adventurous, roborealm is a powerful program for easily and quickly bringing machine vision to your robotics project. ‚ roborealm is $49.95 at normal price, but if you back fritz at $70 and above, you get a copy for no additional cost to you. if we hit $35k , so please forward and tweet this project page link and help us get the word out. how does this compare to other robot products? there are a few products similar to fritz on the market now. ‚ we are convinced that fritz gives the most function for the price. ‚ the biggest value that fritz brings is the control software, which has a picture of fritz's face that moves with fritz's actual robotic parts. ‚ other control software use a slider bar that is labeled "jaw" or "left eye" which is less intuitive than simply dragging a part on a simulated face. ‚ the table below shows how we compare to other products along with price. read some press about fritz‚ click below to see articles published about fritz fritz goes snazzy - acrylic in colors now offered we have had many requests for an acrylic (plastic) with color option, so we have added rewards for acrylic fritz kits. ‚ a quick sample of what acrylic parts look like below. ‚ note that all parts will be acrylic in the kit, not just the faceplate. ‚ we offer fritz in blue, white, red, green, ‚ and clear acrylic. ‚ stay tuned for more colors as we confirm availability. ‚ you will specify color at the end of the project by our survey.‚ here are some sample acrylic units built up. tour de fritz - video of fritz's design below is a video that shows the inner workings of fritz. ‚ see how the eyes and eyelids work. ‚ it's like an anatomy lesson but without the blood and other messy stuff. open source we made fritz to be an affordable and accessible human feature mimicking robot project, not just a cool toy. ‚ fritz will be an open source project. ‚ if we are funded, we will publish all the design files, both hardware and software, so you can build one yourself if you have access to a laser cutter and/or a 3d printer, and have some computer savvy. ‚ in the long term, we want fritz to evolve and become more sophisticated, not just through the efforts of xyzbot, but from hobbyists and professionals all over the world. ‚ we all see humanoid robots in the movies, ‚ walking around and interacting with humans, but a lot of work has to be done to move the technology to that level. ‚ fritz is a great way to facilitate this. ‚ even if you decide to not pledge for a fritz robot, you can consider backing the project to help develop this technology. what are funds used for? fritz has custom parts that have to be manufactured specifically for this product. ‚ we have to have tools made to manufacture these parts. ‚ a big piece of our project goal is taken up by these tooling and setup fees. ‚ we also have to buy parts in bulk to get the lowest cost. ‚ and finally, don't forget that kickstarter and amazon payments take about 10% of the funds raised. ‚ no complaints from us. ‚ we love kickstarter, but not every backer realizes that. no worries of robot world domination t-shirt do you like the idea of fritz but you are afraid of him rebelling and dominating the world? ‚ then get this t shirt to fend off such worries. ‚ you can get behind robotics in technical education, get a great t shirt and sleep soundly at night. bookmark for those that like the idea of an open source robot head project, but don't want to actually buy one, you can help out by backing us at lower levels. ‚ back at $15 level and get a laser cut fritzmark; a bookmark with a distinctive fritz head to stick out of your book and keep an eye on you. ‚ the bookmark is laser cut and engraved from recycled card stock. ‚ below are pictures of the bookmark with the message "fritz lives", but we're open to suggestions on what the final bookmark should say. evolution of fritz, the prototypes we started working on fritz in summer of 2012. ‚ over 6 months, and 20 major revisions later, we are ready to bring to market. here is a photo showing the mechanical design evolution of fritz from neanderthal to robohead sapien. more info?‚ ‚ the video tells the story in brief. if you'd like to see more photos and information, visit our web page at www.xyzbot.com 
 has your phone ever died on you‚Ä¶.? i see you nodding. was it at the most inopportune time? ...keep nodding :) it usually always is. how about, your phone died, you have your charger - but there isn‚Äôt an outlet in sight for you to plug into? or my personal favorite - you pull out one of the many bulky charging devices you own ‚Äúto save you from this type of tragedy‚Äù‚Ä¶only to find, that too - isn‚Äôt charged! you‚Äôre not alone . i was repeatedly experiencing all of the above. dbs (dead battery syndrome) has created a whole new area of high anxiety for us humans to deal with; i can‚Äôt text or get directions, will i miss a call from my boss, a client, my wife or worse‚Ä¶. the kids? it was one of those moments that i found myself asking myself (in a state of disbelief), "how is it that no one's addressed this? why couldn‚Äôt i have been charging in the restaurant that i spent over an hour in? i wouldn‚Äôt be in this mess!" i've been in the technology and product development field for more than 15 years and after seeing the large, clumsy &amp; expensive wall-mounted hardware solutions (you've seen them) that require an unnatural disconnect from our phone (put it in a box and leave it there) entering the market - i decided it was ‚Äútag, i guess you're it, there's a better way to do this‚Äù. so i spent the next 9 months in search of a solution that could - once and for all, change our charging habits, plus remove our reliance on the clutter and expense of solutions that just weren‚Äôt guaranteed to solve the problem for one reason or another. there were so many questions to answer and nine months later, after meetings with partners, locations and governing bodies, we've tweaked and arrived at a position where we've filed our patent and addressed those questions.‚ the overall consumer need was that we had to be a ubiquitous‚ (hence yubi )‚ solution with many concentrated dock locations and it had to support most, if not all devices, in order to be attractive to everyone. so let‚Äôs get started answering your questions right there! with so many manufacturers creating multiple devices, we had to deal with 30-pin, lightning, micro usb and other proprietary power connections. this was quite the challenge! however, we decided that if we can get 80% of the devices ( 97% of the smartphone market) to sit in a dock, then the few remaining could charge via the smart usb hub in the front. the usb also allowed us to extend the charging platform to tablets and devices that can download an app but not sit in the dock trays because of the location of their micro-usb port. (mainly blackberry &amp; sony, position - top left) when designing our smart dock, our goal was to make it as accessible as possible. the left port features an apple lightning connector and comfortably grips all iphones from 5 onward. the right side port had a much trickier task to accomplish. in order to accommodate the large variety of phones utilizing micro-usb, we decided to widen and deepen the channel and incorporate a gripping mechanism that would secure all. this allows users to fit the beefiest of android, windows &amp; even blackberry smartphones. in most cases (unless you have an otterbox), you can even leave your case on. the front-facing usb port allows you to charge devices that would be far too large to fit in the dock slots.‚ sometimes the simplest ideas are the most life-changing. the elements of our technology are not themselves ground-breaking, but it's the way that we've tied them together to do something very interesting that allowed us to file a patent on our solution back in september of 2012. the following videos show the 3 main‚ use cases :‚ 1. ‚ the first video shows how a phone with the yubi app loaded charges normally on your home charging docks &amp; native power cords and how it responds differently when it sits on one of our yubi smart docks.‚ you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 2 . here we explain how it authorizes the phone via a data exchange of just two pieces of information. the dock provides an id# to the phone and the phone provides an .auth code to allow the dock to charge the device. the docks have no storage or network capabilities - meaning that no data is collected or stored from your device. this was very important to us - to ensure consumer confidence and protect their privacy. you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 3. if a phone is completely dead, we can't authorize the phone,‚ ‚ so... t he 3rd use case is to show that we will courtesy charge any device that is completely dead until it is charged enough to enable us to authorize the device. the phone has to be powered "on" for us to do this. if a user leaves their device in the dock beyond the "courtesy charge"in the off position, we will shut off the docks power to the device after the pre-determined time. you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 we originally started with just one dock (marked prototype in the gif below) and very quickly realized that (for the technology to be well recieved) it needed to blend beautifully into an environment without affecting the aesthetic of it's surroundings. we anticipate customizing the line further down the road for different location types. we have had excellent feedback on the restaurant/bar docks and plan on adding walnut and an espresso (brown/black) should our 2nd stretch goal be met. the prototype, as it sits - uses hobbyist boards, but the tech on a mass-production scale will only require tiny chips to house the required technology that authorize devices to charge on our‚ smart docks. it is based on our conversations with electrical engineers/manufacturers that we have been able to create a dock that will be housed in a very small unit at less than 7" wide and 1.5" deep as shown below. a look to the future iterations: ‚ the dock (linked below) is the evolution of the transportation smart docks that will house the "qi" inductive technology that is gaining ground as the future of inductive/proximity charging via the a4wp ‚ (alliance 4 wireless power) and the pma (power matters alliance) . ‚ 3 years from now, it is our intent to change out the docks that will snap on the existing mounting brackets and utilizing the exisiting power harnesses. to see the future click here: the website will be the hub for all things yubi-related. everything from account setup to dock acquisition will be handled via the web platform. the goal is to keep the app as streamlined as possible, maintaining its core function: charging your phone. our ubiquitous network only earns its name if it truly is everywhere. after new york city, we plan to extend the service across the united states. we'll even be in all of your favorite restaurants so you'll always know where you can grab a charge. from san francisco to austin to washington d.c. yubi will be everywhere you need it to be. you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 the initial goal gets us to market with 5,000 smart docks in nyc !!! it enables us to fully develop our prototypes to production ready specs for manufacturing, enables us to develop the app across the remaining mobile platforms (android, windows and blackberry) and create the back-end portal for the smart dock location partners. myself and the 2 current team members will be able to leave our full-time jobs, moving into office space where we can focus all of our time and effort on yubi. 3 key positions will also be filled to focus on customer service, location growth and developing/executing our supply chain strategy. this will ensure a successful and coordinated launch for fall 2014. at this goal, we can also begin executing our social consumer marketing strategy. this goal enables us to launch with 10,000 smart docks in nyc . we will also extend our lo-profie dock housing family with 4 other finishes (7 total), glacier white, birch, walnut and espresso. it will also allow for the addition of 3 yubi branded service vehicles and the introduction of our reward program. we will also have the time/bandwidth to pursue the sponsorship and partner opportunities to raise additional cash for the business. this enables us to place an initial inventory order for 20,000 smart docks (reducing per dock costs by a substantial 8%) to cover a nyc launch of 10,000 with 5,000 each for the boston &amp; philadelphia markets. we will hire, completing the full "market advance team" of 6 people to integrate the full first-wave of the location roll-out plan (20 cities) and expand our team in other core areas. our timeline started 9 months before this. so much prep work has been completed that the execution phase will happen relatively quickly over 5 months. zoom in to see the detail as it goes far beyond the manufacturing &amp; development aspects of the business. we had so much fun putting these "thank you's" together. we wanted to be sure that the gear rocked and offered real value for money! as the founder, i am the most excited about our "immortalization wall" as a way of expressing our gratitude. this will be something that all those that end up working "for and with us" will see as a constant reminder of how we got our start. ...so what you're saying is that you like yubi! thank you from the bottom of our batteries :) yours could be the $1 dollar that put's us over our goal :) we're humbled by your support and can't wait to come to your town! thanks! we couldn't do this without you and as a show of gratitude we're adding your name to our website's 'power founders' page. a big ‚Äúyubi‚Äùlicious thank you! you are now to be immortalized in not only our kickstarter founder infographic on the web, but we are going to blow it up huge and have an entire wall in our offices, so that all can see the part you played in our beginnings! it‚Äôs time for the first supercool gift! there‚Äôs shirts and then there‚Äôs our shirts. pick short/long sleeve, girls or boys and sport this little number at the gym or add it to your ‚Äújammies‚Äù wardrobe!

around the turn of the 20th century, a young ‚Äòcg petterson‚Äô started building his distinctive idea of wooden motor boats. his designs introduced northern europe to the joys of motor boating. no longer a domain of the rich and famous, petterson ensured that the average family man would be able to get afloat, in style and safety. producing over a thousand designs, each boat, around 27 foot long, was different, but all shared similar design features. namely the distinctive ‚Äúarrow‚Äù shape of the forward deck. together with a small forward cabin; and an open cockpit, people were able to both enjoy the long summer sunshine and have somewhere to ‚Äòdodge‚Äô to if the weather turned inclement. the design was popular and sold well right up until world war two. during the late forties and fifties wooden boat production went the same way as elsewhere in the world. the flooding tide of fiberglass drowned continued development of wooden craft. using a design that remains faithful to petterson‚Äôs, incorporating the ‚Äùarrow‚Äù of the foredeck, and other features we have a boat that is definitely in the spirit and appearance of petterson‚Äôs ideal. switching from traditional mahogany building to modern composite construction, allows for a relatively inexpensive hull. whilst remaining faithful to the appearance of petterson boat, we have gone one step further by incorporating a modern underwater design, that will ensure our boat has a turn of speed, economy and safety that will compete with mass produced boats of a similar size and class. as the boat grows in physical size, so does the costs, both materials and specialized tools. some of the ‚Äúnon-wooden‚Äù aspects of boat building ‚Äì propellers, shafts, and keeping in line with coast guard specifications also have to be addressed. the nature of our composite construction lends itself nicely to cnc participation. should the boat have a successful future, they can be produced quickly and inexpensively. future boats can be sold as a complete unit or to any stage of completion as per the customer‚Äôs requirement. in special circumstances a kit form of the boat could be sold to qualified people. the design concept of our petterson retro project also offers itself to many other types‚Äô historic craft being recreated and enjoyed by future generations in respect of cg petterson‚Äôs original plan to offer stylish motor boating to the average man, i feel we can do the same again. this time the boats are lighter, stronger, faster, more economical to run and require a minimum of maintenance. they will also last considerably longer!

 for many of us ... we are becoming a number. ‚ whether that is a social security number, a credit card number or a membership number. ‚ but each number in life is unique ... and like the number pi, it is our special qualities which show us where we fit into the equation of life. we live in the single, shining moment of "now," but our lives are overwhelmingly made up of the past.‚ we must understand the past and learn from it if we are to understand ourselves, our society, and, in doing so, make progress towards a brighter future. ‚ the key to understanding the past is the knowledge that people then did not live in the past-they lived in the present, just a different present from ours. ‚ the present we are living in will be the past sooner than we wish. ‚ what we perceive as its uniqueness will come to be seen as just a part of the past as viewed from the point of a future present that will, in turn, see itself as unique. ‚Äú understanding how each of us is unique is an essential part of questioning who we are and why humanity exists. ‚Äù our potential is a paradox that makes us at the same time both a part of the human family and unique within that family. we are united by our having gifts, talents, life callings, and dreams of an extraordinary life.‚ but we are each unique because all of our gifts, talents, life callings and dreams are different. {bio}ciety believes that this is not a time of an unprecedented "information revolution," or similarly transformational events, but we are at a point in the ever-evolving history of technology and society that has been foreshadowed by technological innovations over the centuries. we are in the year of 2014 and {bio}ciety wants to preserve our present with the future by bringing the people of the twenty-first century together and sharing our differences between their lives and ours. when a person of the year 2100 looks back at the quaint old world of 2014, they will probably see a gigantic gulf between then and now.‚ however that may be, here we are, in this present, peering at the future, but able to look back with clarity because {bio}ciety has preserved the records of humankind.‚ i hope that the person one hundred years from now will have the same ability to read, view, and hear the information of today and tomorrow. {bio}ciety will be inviting people from around the world to contribute personal photos, stories, thoughts ideas, poems, songs, home movies, and art to this first ever digital ‚Äòbiocube‚Äô time capsule designed to document life on earth! we want people to represent their culture and show what is important to them. it will be fascinating to see what children and adults submit which will be shared with generations to come.‚ users will be able to visit the {bio}cube time capsule site and upload text, images, video, audio and drawings. everyone from students to seniors are encouraged to participate with submissions on topics such as: ‚ in addition, {bio}ciety will be working with children around the world and providing each child a ‚Äòdigital wish‚Äô to upload their ideas of ‚Äúwhat makes you unique?‚Äù whether it is a photo, poem or a song, it will be preserved for many years to come.‚ a compilation of selected ideas will be published for future generations. our goal is to launch the first ever {bio}cube time capsule which will have the shared information from people across the world stored and saved forever.‚ we are working with the education and public outreach of utias/sfl which has performed numerous successful cubesat launches. this service was originally motivated by the needs of the canadian advanced nanospace experiment (canx) program.with {bio}ciety being in close proximity to the launch site, the knowledge to build it, and access to a laboratory to produce the {bio}cube , we are optimistic that the mission will be successful. our goal is to launch the {bio}cube in june of 2016. our goal of $20,000 on kickstarter will give us the resources to complete stage 1 of the mission.‚ these funds will be used to start collecting the life's stories from people around the world that will be stored on the {bio}cube satellite.‚ it will contribute to the web‚ development‚ and videographer to‚ assist in creating an area to upload and capture these moments and ideas. it will also give the engineers the opportunity to start planning the development of the {bio}cube satellite.‚ the satellite will consist of: adcs -

 hello! my name is mark wyner. in addition to being a father of five, husband to one, and a master scorpion catcher*, i am a league bowler and a veteran web designer/developer. the last two are relevant to this project. the others are relevant to why you might want to pledge support for my project. because kids need to eat and scorpions need to lose in a standoff in your kitchen. so here‚Äôs the skinny on leaguefriend‚Ñ¢. (oh‚Äîthat‚Äôs the name of the application, by the way.) i‚Äôve been a bowler in two leagues for around four years. each week we get this little black/white sheet with updated scores, standings, and the like based on the previous week‚Äôs session. the information is really packed in and there‚Äôs nothing there beyond the previous week‚Äôs numbers and some season highs. one of my leagues posts these sheets online. not the data, though, just image files of the sheets. and there is no way to cross reference anything or communicate with anyone else in your league. and the site it littered with ads and other blinking animations to make the entire experience second rate. moreover, forget trying to access anything on a mobile device. so i‚Äôm sitting there a couple years back wondering why there isn‚Äôt even a moderately decent web application for league bowlers. i dig around and find nothing of consequence. really? well, hell, i design/build websites for a living. i should just make one. two years later and i‚Äôm still creeping up on this thing. without any funding i can‚Äôt dedicate my time to it. i spend my days with a studio of clients and my evenings/weekends with my family. but this is two years in the making, and it‚Äôs really close to being finished. and if i don‚Äôt finish it soon, someone is going to beat me to market. so last fall my wife and i decided we would dive in and take a leap of faith. i would turn away client work this spring and dedicate my time to getting this ready in time to launch before summer leagues. it‚Äôs paying off, but the money reserves are running low and the credit cards are going to begin seeing some serious action. and that‚Äôs where you come in, dear people of the web. i‚Äôm so close i can taste it. but i need some funding to push me over the finish line and get this to market. so what does leaguefriend‚Ñ¢ do? it enables league secretaries to manage their leagues with ease and affords bowlers an opportunity to keep a watchful eye on standings and statistics for themselves, their teams, and their leagues. data that‚Äôs accessible in a number of relevant ways, housed in an interface that‚Äôs been designed and built by someone who not only understands the best practices of web design, but is also part of the target audience. as a league bowler i know what i want. i have also conversed with a number of other league bowlers and league secretaries to learn more about what they want. combined with my seasoned experience in web design, i truly believe this application is destined to be huge. i even have a road map with loads of new features which will make their appearances in new versions of the app moving forward. but here‚Äôs the best part. mobile use is front of mind. today‚Äôs web is going mobile in a big way. the first version will have a web-based version of the interface available to anyone with an modern mobile device. shortly after the initial release free native-apps will be published in app stores for iphone, android, palm, blackberry, and nokia. anyone with a leaguefriend‚Ñ¢ account will be able to use them. there will also be a second version of the native app called leaguefriend‚Ñ¢ solo‚Ñ¢. this app is a sister app of the main application for bowlers who aren‚Äôt in leagues. it has most of the same features, but focuses on single bowlers wanting to track their own statistics. this has been a long time coming and i just need this extra push. the funding will enable me to pay my bills while i reach the finish line of this first release and will provide some marketing dollars i need to get the word out. philanthropic bonus as an extension of the philanthropic efforts of my wife and i, we will be donating a percentage of profits from‚ leaguefriend‚Ñ¢ to the beaverton education foundation. they fund programs in our local school district, which is where our five children are educated during the week. thank you in advance to anyone who pledges to support my efforts. your funding will make more of a difference than you can imagine. cheers! *as noted in the rewards section, those who pledge $25 or more will get to hear my scorpion-catching story. faq

 could you, your students or staff benefit from an online system that reliably improves retention of key phrases and concepts? if you're accustomed to charting performance, why not let an online application do your recording and charting for you? want to improve your skills at writing effective flash cards? we‚Äôve created an‚ easy-to-use ‚ online application that takes online flash card applications to the next level by incorporating the safmeds methodology that has been proven by years of classroom usage. along with this application, dr. kent johnson has written a tutorial to teach anyone how to write fluency flashcards. fluency flashcard application is disrupting learning content. our reason for starting this project is simple: there were no high-end online fluency flash card application that met the quality standards of the professional flash card designers and users.‚ we are dr. kent johnson, founder and director of morningside academy, in seattle washington, and ms. vicci tucci, founder and director of tucci learning solutions in watsonville, ca. as educators from the fields of‚ precision teaching, direct instruction, and applied behavior analysis, we were fortunate enough to experience the best and most effective ‚Äúpaper version‚Äù flash card process to develop fluent performance with any content.‚ however, colleagues were often overwhelmed ‚ by how labor intensive it was to deliver fluency-based instruction and monitor performance. subsequently, they often abandoned the use of fluency-based instruction, so we could intervene, if needed. so, in 2012, we decided to build a technological solution to this problem ourselves, and we are now ready to share it with the world.‚ we‚Äôve created an easy-to-use online application that that takes online flash card applications to the next level by incorporating the safmeds technology that has been proven by years of classroom usage ( reference articles .) along with this application, dr. kent johnson has written a tutorial to teach anyone how to write effective fluency flashcards.‚ building upon an innovative, evidence-based learning method (safmeds), perfected through decades of real-world use in diverse educational settings, fluency flashcards is a web 2.0 application. it allows users to practice learning information to fluency, beyond accuracy‚Äìguaranteeing retention, endurance and application of their performance.‚ learners can build flash card decks of up to 84 cards, and practice in deck subsets that are cumulatively reviewed until the learner reaches a fluency aim. fluency is based upon the learner‚Äôs rate of performance in one-minute timings.‚ after each timing performance data are plotted on a timings celeration chart that automatically appears. the best of the day's timings are plotted on a daily‚ celeration‚ chart that also automatically appears after the day's practice session.‚ shuffled cards pass through a series of decks on the way to meeting the fluency aim. a unique feature tracks latency data for each card. cards whose performance latencies are below the average latency required for a deck continue to appear in timings, giving a learner an opportunity to practice beyond accuracy to fluency.‚ in an accompanying video tutorial, dr. kent johnson details how to write effective flashcards illustrating different kinds of learning, such as definitions, descriptions, equivalences, concepts and principles; and how to conduct effective practice timings to promote fluency and rapid growth in learning.‚ gamification &amp; ‚ reinforcement.‚ badges and other "cheerleading" events pop up throughout the process encouraging the learner to continue and making learning less of a chore‚ and more of a fun game where you can compete against yourself and (coming soon) against your peers. detailed analytics.‚ using standard celeration charts, learners get clear and informative data on their progress toward meeting a fluency aim for each deck. fluency aims can be set based upon card content.‚ instructors and or co-instructors can receive‚ reports ‚ about their learners performance in meeting their aim for a given set of cards. the instructors can use these reports to determine if they need to intervene to assist the learner to meet their aim. we will be ready for final stages of production with your support.‚ so where are we in this own process of bringing fluency flashcards to market?:‚ ‚Ä¢ formed an very collaborative set of team members in usa (i.e., california and washington) and british columbia‚ ‚Ä¢ developed and user-tested 5 generations of prototypes‚ ‚Ä¢ written and optimized thousands of lines of code‚ ‚Ä¢ engineered the application to be intuitive for developers and users ‚Ä¢ developed and tested an innovative weighted randomization algorithm to display cards that need work more often the final tasks that require additional funding are:‚ ‚ ‚Ä¢ develop an online 2 player mode where a user (learner) can rehearse content with another user (learner) ‚Ä¢ develop a hybrid mobile app that leverages the best of the mobile interface to interact with the cloud-based ffca system ‚Ä¢ field test fluency flashcards application (ffca) ‚Ä¢ complete our restful api for implementing the ffca as part of other e-learning systems and custom applications ‚Ä¢ develop training to teach learners and developers to write fluency flashcards ‚Ä¢ verify developers flashcards submitted for use by learners if you decide to pitch in, you‚Äôll be one of the first developers and users (learners) ‚ to learn to write fluency flash cards. but more importantly, you will play a huge part in providing learners with an online application that will greatly assist them in ‚Äútrue mastery‚Äù of content.‚ thank you so much for your support if you decide to do so.

 upon travelling to different cities including cape town, johannesburg london, new york ‚ and barcelona i realised that there is only so much that the hotel concierge can tell you. there is a lot going on in every city and i realised that in johannesburg for example i wanted chinese food during a day out but there was no way to find our where the closest one was even though there were numerous. so i realised if i had an app that would tell me where i am and tell me the closets place and how to get there that would save a lot of time. and it is this time that is precious to us all because we will never get that back.‚ it was then i set out to create a concierge company that would enable visitors and locals to african countries this app and service this is because tour companies and and hotels do not necessarily take care of you once you have left your hotel or tour. it is always convenient to have a number or app to call when you are on the go or do not have time or access to any information.‚ why africa african destinations have risen in popularity over the past 5 years ‚ with numbers topping 3million in 2013 with south africa being nearly 1 million tourists. the market is ripe and in conjunction with the tourist board are in the process of providing value to these tourists.‚ we are due to set up a contact centre with experienced concierge assistants ‚ in nairobi and johannesburg to handle customer requests. this service is not only exclusive to tourists it will also apply to the many working people that have no time or do not have access to go to the places that they really want to. from requests from a cleaner for your house or entry to that establishment for dinner that your partner has wanted to go to we will make it happen.concierge in africa is an untapped market and we are set to capitalise on this by adding value to the many sectors‚ 
 ‚ summary guitar zero! a programmable circuit created with the explicit purpose of recording, saving, sharing, and replaying guitar hero / rock band song tracks. aka: a self-playing xbox 360 game controller to wow your friends and woo your mate. finish those songs, earn those achievements, beat that game. we have built a working prototype, but further work needs to be done to grow this technology into the "diy hobbyist kit" we want it to be. it has the potential to work on every guitar hero, rock band, and similar game + hardware. we need your ideas, suggestions, and funding to turn this one-off prototype into a diy kit available for purchase. thanks for your interest! ‚ what's my money going towards? 1. motivation. is this an idea that anyone likes? kickstarter, you are my test market. 2. refine the design. work down the cost, work out any (unforseen) bugs, build the documentation that makes this reproducible.‚ 3. purchase and build the necessary hardware and equipment to reliably manufacture, assemble, install, and test this circuitry. 4. economy of scale: the more of these i buy components for, the cheaper each component is. it's hella-expensive to build just one of anything. 5. did you pre-order a kit? your money bought you a kit! at a pretty sweet "in before he knows what it's worth" discount! 6. ya done good, kid! you're bringing a cool idea to fruition and sharing the love. kickin' that starter forward, as it were. rock on. virtually and otherwise. ‚ what is this " bahdink.com " referenced in the rewards? it is a achievement-related gaming website i am helping develop. it'll include the expected features of 'cheevo tracking, user forums, guides, etc... but it'll allow for some online achievement-based challenges and competitions between users or groups of users. we're gearing up for an alpha test of the database and want to extend a special invitation to the kickstarters who help get the guitar zero off the ground. thanks! additionally, when the kickstarter campaign concludes (successfully), bahdink.com ‚ is where you'll be able to find more information about- and purchase the finished guitar zero. what games/songs does this kit support right now: band hero guitar hero 2 guitar hero 3 guitar hero: world tour guitar hero 5 guitar hero: aerosmith guitar hero: metallica guitar hero: smash hits guitar hero: van halen guitar hero: warrior of rock lego rock band rock band rock band 2 rock band: the beatles for each of these games, each song on expert for both guitar and bass (or rhythm guitar) have track files available, and a whole host of dlc songs and track packs beyond that. it's like 1900 or 2000 songs in full, obviously including your favorites: the devil went down to georgia eruption hangar 18 jordan raining blood satch boogie sudden death through the fire and flames not only that, the chip is‚ re-programmable‚ with a ttl serial to usb cable to either a windows or mac pc. this means that when the next game comes out, you can download some new files and power through any tricky songs there. who are you? we are a team of three gamers by nature. one mechanical engineer, one electrical engineer, and one web developer. our interests and our skills have come together to fuel the guitar zero development. what's the status of the prototype? we've built and programmed a prototype board and used it to power the video footage you see above as well as the following demonstrations of its power: frequently asked questions: q: does the guitar zero support "pro guitar" in rock band 3? a: no, this modification only supports the classic, 5-button guitars. q: is every song a 100%, full-combo? a: no. most song files are direct conversions from the actual game file, but sometimes errors occur. the guitar will incorporate a "play thru" mode... where you will be able to add in a note missing from the track file as you are playing the song. q: what guitars work with the chipset? a: xplorer (gh2) and les paul (gh3). we have plans to expand to the stratocaster immediately, but you can help guide which controllers we incorporate next with some higher donation levels. q: how difficult is the installation? a: if you're handy with a soldering iron, that's all the experience you'll need. we'll provide detailed instructions on what to solder where. we're exploring options now to minimize the amount of soldering end-users will need to do by utilizing pin/socket interfaces rather than soldering discrete wires. you will need the following: soldering iron solder discrete wire (xx ga, xx" total length) t10 torx driver (les paul guitar disassembly) wire cutters electrical tape q: what exactly comes with the "kit"? a: the guitar zero cca (pre-assembled and pre-programmed) and complete and detailed instructions and demonstration videos showing exactly where to mount and how to tie it into the guitar. q: i live in &lt;non united states country&gt;, can i have one? a: sure! add +$10 to your donation for international shipping on the kit or +$15 per guitar. q: can star power or overdrive be activated? a: yep! neither the whammy bar nor the tilt sensor are actuated by the guitar zero circuitry, so any use (or extra generation) of sp/od must be handled manually. faq 
 special promotional offer at ebay! or pre-order at amazon! i have designed an automatic aluminum can crusher (patent pending) for residential use and i'm currently building the prototype. once i get the bugs worked out, i will need funding for production tooling. i don't know of anyone one who sells one of these for household recycling use. there are several industrial and commercial units available, but they are all too expensive and not practical for having around the house. the unit will be powered by a common, power tool battery and/or an ac adapter, and the production version will adjust to fit almost any trash or recycling container. it's a fun and practical device for reducing the amount of wasted space in your recycle container, and i think there is enough interest to buy these that it should supply a steady cash flow for my new business so that i can design more unique and creative products. thank you for your interest, and you can learn more about my startup at http://www.zertronix.com/ faq 
 background backyard brains is a small diy company with the goal of spreading an interest in neuroscience to the public. ‚ the brain is poorly understood by most everyone... and‚ neuroscience‚ is typically not taught until late undergrad or graduate school. ‚ we feel that exposing people to how the brain works at an earlier age will help get kids thinking about a career in neuroscience. ‚ and we could‚ definitely‚ use the help! ‚ 1 out of 5 people will suffer from a neurological disease where there is not a known cure! ‚ ‚ why write a paper? we have developed low-costs tools to investigate the brain, but teachers have told us they need help when preparing lesson plans and lectures. ‚ we decided it would be a good idea to publish a paper that teachers and amateurs could use to understand and perform experiments. ‚ we wrote a paper that outlines four neuroscience experiments for publication in the journal plos one . ‚ the paper includes a teachers guide with background information on the experiments, plus student handouts for use in class. ‚ each experiment has it's own separate hand-out, so educators can choose which section they wish to cover. ‚ we have also included an engineering section which details how we designed the spikerbox, and steps for building one yourself. abstract although people are generally interested in how their brain functions, neuroscience education to the public is hampered by a lack of low cost and engaging teaching materials. to address this, we developed an open-source tool, the spikerbox, which is appropriate for use in middle/high school educational programs and by amateurs. this device can be used in easy experiments in which students insert sewing pins into the leg of a cockroach, or other invertebrate, to amplify and listen to the electrical activity of neurons. with the cockroach leg preparation, students can hear and see (using a smartphone oscilloscope app we have developed) the dramatic changes in activity that occur when the mechanosensitive barbs are touched. students can also experiment with other manipulations such as temperature, drugs, and microstimulation that affect the neural activity. we include teaching guides and other resources in the supplemental materials. these hands-on lessons with the spikerbox have proven to be effective in teaching basic neuroscience. the experiments‚ experiment i: how do nerves carry information about touch?‚ students learn the concept of ‚Äúrate-coding‚Äù by listening to the changes in neural discharge in response to touch using the cockroach leg preparation. location-dependent (or ‚Äúsomatotopic‚Äù) responses can be illuminated by touching several areas along the leg. experiment ii: how do neurons generate electricity? ‚ by selectively heating and cooling the cockroach leg, students can indirectly observe the properties of ion channels and their influence on spikes. experiment iii: how does your brain tell your muscles to move? by using the analog output of a portable mp3 device or laptop, students can measure the effect of frequency and amplitude on the initiation of movements in the cockroach leg. ‚ the use of electricity to create neural or muscle activity is called ‚Äúmicrostimulation‚Äù. experiment iv: how do drugs affect neurons?‚ the effects of ‚Äúneuroactive‚Äù agents on the central nervous system can be studied to explain the function of synapses and neurotransmitters. ‚ two types of neurotransmitter agents, chemicals involved in neuron-to-neuron communication, are injected into the cns of a cricket. ‚ students can analyze the behavioural and neural recording results to determine the effects of each. about the publication process most journals charge‚ subscribers‚ to read their articles. ‚ we wanted our articles to be available to everyone, so we decided to publish in an open-access journal: plos one . the idea behind open-access is that the authors pay up front to publish, so the readers can get access to the articles for free. we are asking for help with the $1,350 required to get our paper published in plos one (their standard rate for non-institutional‚ authors). ‚ if you help us defray the publication costs, you will be added to the‚ acknowledgment‚ section of our paper. ‚ you can get involved in the scientific publication process! you can help teachers access teaching materials for free. ‚ faq doesn t plos offer a waiver if you cannot afford to publish? yes, plos one kindly offers waivers if authors do not have money to pay the publishing fee. from what we hear, they have never declined a request to waive the fee for anyone. but we are doing this kickstarter for 2 reasons. 1) we believe strongly in the open-access, and want to support plos in their efforts. we do not want them to have to cover our costs, as plos has to keep lights on too. we d like to encourage their business model. 2) we d like to set a precedent where the community, if they are interested in a project, can help fund a project s dissemination and publication. our teacher colleagues have asked about this option, as the number of open access journals is still pretty limited. so consider this an experiment in crowd-sourcing projects for educators to publish in open-access journals! last updated: fri, dec 30 2011 11:21 am est you reached your target! hooray! but kickstarter and amazon each take 3-5% of the money. do you need more funding? we decided it made for a cleaner narrative to request the exact amount of $1350 on the plos one invoice (see update). we ve raised $1426 now, which will help offset the cuts kickstarter and amazon will take. we also have &quot;skin in the game&quot; too and can add whatever more is needed. so, at this point, we don t need any more backers. thanks so much though. to the neurorevolution! last updated: sun, jan 8 2012 3:49 pm est did your paper already get accepted into plos one? yes! it was a long struggle. we were assigned manuscript #pone-d-11-11302 back on june 27, 2011 when we first submitted it. three revisions and six months later, we are happy to report the reviewers and editors have signed off on it! the journal is awaiting final proofs. we will add the kickstarter backers to our acknowledgement and submit our final version on jan 12. last updated: thu, dec 29 2011 11:54 am est ask a question 
 why did you start the development of vloggger? what is the point? vlogging is awesome, but lets face it, it can get cumbersome at times. for example, lugging around a camera all day or even the amount of time it takes to edit the vlog once you are done filming. what if there were a way to easily film, edit, and share your vlogs all on your iphone. no more advanced editing software needed! vloggger will do everything for you. i don't want to spend a lot of money on equipment, who is vloggger being made for? vloggger, with your help will be an app that will not only help current experienced vloggers, but also aspiring ones who just don‚Äôt have the means for advanced equipment. okay, but how does it work? what is this 'easy user-interface' you speak of? it‚Äôs simple. here is how it works: you film your vlog using a very easy to use ‚Äòas long as your finger is on the screen, you are recording‚Äô interface. the segments of your vlog are organized into clips. the clips are editable in our user-friendly interface. once you have completed your deleting, rearranging, renaming of clips, you can then preview your vlog. if you like it, with the tap of a button you can share directly to youtube, right from the app! do you have any screenshots/mockups of the app? will it look nice? here is a shot of what the recording screen would look like, you'd have 5 controls (back to projects menu, toggle flash, recording toggle, rear/front facing camera toggle, and sharing options). even though vloggger will do a lot of the editing for you, you can still delete, rearrange, or rename the clips you've taken. this can be done from the clips page corresponding to your project. here is a mockup of that: those are just a few of the designs that we have been experimenting with. please don't make your judgment of whether you like the app or not now, because again, these are just mockups and are subject to change. what do you need the money for? we need the money for development and design costs. the images you see now are merely mockups. we want to pack vloggger with awesome features, so you can have the best experience! we would really love to have vloggger available for iphone shortly (few weeks) after we are successfully funded. that is awesome! when will it be out, and how can i help? well, we think so too. but vloggger won‚Äôt go anywhere without your support. a few ways you can help are to spread the word and tell all your friends and family! while extra pr is always nice, we do need to fund this startup, and you can help us with that here, on kickstarter. with your support, hopefully we can get vloggger in your pocket very very soon. how can i stay in touch? follow us on twitter for instant updates on the development of vloggr: http://twitter.com/vlogggerapp . but if you have any specific questions, you can email our support team at: support@vloggger.com ! if you want to read a little bit more about us, check out our blog at: http://vloggger.com ! 
 the project descriptions are as follows: ‚ first, i need to aquire a small sailboat (18-23 feet) that can be used for the experiment. ‚ cape dory weekender is the prefered model. ‚ other equipment will incude small solar power system, cooling system, and means to compfortably sustain one to two people with and without external power. 
 mobile marketing made easy &amp; affordable ! for small business: mobile users send and receive trillions of sms text messages around the world each year, and communicate more frequently through sms‚ (short message service, commonly known as a ‚Äútext‚Äù)‚ than making phone calls or emailing. shouldn‚Äôt they be able to communicate the same way with your business? we are giving entrepreneurs, startups, merchants, retailers and small businesses easy and affordable access to own, create and control their own smart text marketing technology.‚ we are cutting out the middlemen and monopoly of the common short code administration (csca). why wait up to 90 days for their services, approvals and pay their very expensive setup and leasing fees, when you don‚Äôt have to? it should be quick, simple and cheap for any local business to text its mobile customers and for customers to be able to text their local businesses. better communication leads to better deals. that's what smush is all about. save money with smushbox! with smushbox, you can save tons of money while controlling your own mobile marketing destiny. no need to rent keywords or pay for dedicated, random or shared short codes, which can cost thousands of dollars. no need to sign up with 3rd party sms marketing services that charge high administrative, setup and per credit fees. it‚Äôs your business, with your very own number, so now you can easily run your own crm campaigns with advanced sms options for: retail stores, restaurants, hair salons, dental offices, hotels, nightclubs, radio stations, fitness and beauty, real estate, churches, schools, bands, deejays, entertainers,‚ live events and more. for developers: as more and more e-commerce and technical support websites require login credentials to track their users, the security mechanisms for verifying and validating new user accounts are becoming increasingly important. for example when a user applies for a new account on a website, the owner of the site must verify that it is indeed a human and not a spambot. the prevailing method has been to send an email to the user asking them to click a link to validate their account. however, since email addresses can easily be created on the fly, such validations are no longer full proof. practically everyone who uses the internet has a mobile phone with basic sms capabilities, so it makes perfect sense to leverage sms as a validation tool . companies like google are already taking the lead and are using this technology as a validation method for new gmail accounts. implementation of this technology currently requires contracting with a business sms gateway service. in many cases, these services require a 2-year contract along with sms texting plans and limitations that do not meet the exact needs of the sms gateway customer. enter the smushbox , a small router sized device that provides small business customers an affordable alternative to costly gateway services. for a fraction of the cost, you get unlimited 2-way sms texting, unlimited mobile subscribers, with no contracts or hidden fees. smush sms technology: ‚ hardware &amp; software the smush converter box gives even low bandwidth applications the ability to send information by reliable, affordable sms text messages through an easy xml network interface. this ready-to-use solution simply plugs into the ethernet network or switch and connects to the wireless network.‚ user data is private ,‚ safe and secure with our system! ‚ no 3rd party selling of info, no spam.‚ now, applications can send/receive instructions, mass messages, premium sms, auto responses, status updates, alerts or other information to other systems or personnel, from any pc.‚ users can even use the smushbox to configure applications in the field. our smush software provides an easy interface to manage multiple sms marketing campaigns and mobile data collection efforts via pc/web. it‚Äôs smart sms technology in a little box, made to be simple, open and affordable to everyone. kickstarter "retail" price is not the actual retail price for our commercial release.‚ we are giving all kickstarters a discount at every reward level!‚ thanks for having our back, so we have yours as well!‚ save a few bucks on a smushbox right now. how can smushbox help your business? text messages are a great way to connect with and market to your existing customers. why? because they're cheap and easy to send, your customers actually read them, and they're unobtrusive. smushbox gives you multiple ways to communicate better with your customers.‚ 1.) appointment reminders - when a customer misses an appointment (hair, dentist, doctor, restaurants, etc.) that's lost revenue for your business. studies show that unobtrusive text message reminders dramatically cut down on no-shows. 2.) mass text messages - type a message once and send it to all of your customers, groups, followers or fans. schedule automated texts and tailored responses as well. 3.) mobile coupons - text messages are a fast, efficient way to offer mobile coupons to existing customers and new customers alike. mobile coupon campaigns are a popular and quickly growing solution that is portable, individually targeted and paperless. 4.) text-2-join - encourage people to text your keyword to an sms code to join your marketing list. works great for any small business or startup looking to save money on traditional advertising and instantly reach their customer base. 5.) text-2-win - customers text a keyword to an sms code to win a contest. incentivized campaigns are one of the fastest ways to build your marketing list. coca-cola uses this method in a lot of their print, outdoor and tv marketing campaigns. 6.) text-2-vote - run polls and voting efforts that customers can participate in by sending a text message. american idol uses this method for their tv audience to cast votes. 7.) text-2-give ‚Äì people can text to donate to a particular political campaign, relief fund or non-profit organization. president obama and red cross use this method for raising money. 8.) auto-response messages ‚ - set up a list of auto-reply messages that respond with the appropriate info immediately back to customers/fans/followers that text your sms number. based on keywords, smushbox will know what to filter and will automatically respond accordingly to that person with the right message (ex. customers texting in about location, store hours, confirmations, coupon redemptions, show dates, sales promotions, rsvp guest lists, etc.). it's that easy to stay connected with your expanding customer base, using smushbox! 9.) emergency notifications - (reverse 911) sms‚ text messaging alerts are direct, personal, and can be delivered in seconds to thousands of opt-in recipients (employees, students, parents, etc.). the smushbox allows emergency response teams to create, send and deliver time-sensitive alerts to community members from a computer or mobile device. &gt;&gt;&gt; smushbox still works even when your internet or server is down! text sells! don't leave anything on the table:‚ if you have a brick and mortar business with a window put your keyword call-to-action up on a sign. give potential customers a reason to opt-in (like a mobile coupon, which you can automatically text back) and you'll pick up customers who never even step inside your business. get more out of print, radio and tv:‚ if you're advertising in print, on the radio or on television, adding an sms text keyword call-to-action, is a great way to leverage your existing marketing spending. text easier than a phone call &amp; less obtrusive: ‚ calling your customers to remind them about appointments, or payment reminders? you're wasting your time and most likely bothering your customers. send them a text message instead, which they can read when they want to. you'll save time and money too. last minute messaging: ‚ when you need to let a lot of people know about something at the last minute nothing beats a text message. example: you manage a restaurant and it looks like it‚Äôs going to be a cold, rainy night. instead of settling for a slow shift send out a last minute text message enticing customers in with a mobile coupon offering a free cup of soup with any entree. entertainers, like musicians, deejays and comedians, can text their fan base about last minute performances in their local area. text more likely to be read than an email: ‚ email suffers from a spam problem. if your marketing message gets through, who knows if it will even be read. that, and despite the fact that more and more americans own smartphones, most people do not check their email on the go. if you want to reach your customers, wherever they are, whenever you need to, text messaging is the best way to get the job done. get busy with a smushbox: ‚ some days, business can be a little slow. why sit and wait on customers to come to you when you can reach out to them? with a smushbox, you can immediately reach out to your customers with a quick daily promotion or to remind them of today's sale. no more slow days! why be a slave to just tv/radio/print, or even online advertising? customers aren't always in front of the tv, in their cars or in front of their computers... but they do always have their mobile phone with them! cost-effective sms service what the other guys are charging - ‚ registering and leasing a short code through standard sms services, like the common short code administration (csca), costs $1,000 per month for each selected code and $500 per month for each random code. setup time can take up to 90 days. even renting a keyword for 3 months can costs over $400 and the csca requires $3000 up front for their services. these fees are non-refundable regardless of whether any wireless carrier agrees to activate your short code. *smush is offering kickstarters unlimited sms/texting for only $25 a month!‚ ‚ no set up fees, no renting keywords, no waiting, no contracts, no hassles. you get unlimited texting every month, your own long code/phone number, unlimited keywords and easy mobile data management from your pc. once you have our smush kit, you‚Äôll have access to smart, fast and effective sms marketing technology, just like the big guys, but now more affordable!


 15 second summary: what is the ssahrs? the ssahrs is a very small, highly accurate electronic device that produces pitch, roll and yaw (heading) measurements one hundred times per second. ‚ it contains precision sensors and advanced algorithms that produce high quality results even in moving systems. ‚ factory calibration is sufficient to achieve this, but for the most discriminating applications we provide the tools to go even further. ‚ an optional bluetooth daughter board adds wireless capability. introduction the simplemems solid-state attitude and heading reference sensor (ssahrs) distinguishes itself from other products on the market with the combination of high performance, temperature stable mems sensors and our vibration-resistant fusion algorithms in an extremely small and versatile package.‚ an optional bluetooth daughterboard adds wireless communication capability.the ssahrs produces an overall accuracy of 1‚∞ (2sigma) in pitch and roll and nominal 1‚∞ (1sigma) in heading. ‚ heading accuracy depends on the magnetic environment, however our built-in hard/soft iron magnetic calibration algorithms help minimize the effects. an attitude heading and reference system (ahrs) is a device capable of measuring heading (yaw), pitch, and roll angles of an object moving through three dimensional space.‚ data from three different sensors: a magnetometer, accelerometer, and gyroscope are fused to calculate pitch, roll, and yaw of a moving body.‚ in static conditions, where the system is stationary, pitch and roll can be completely and accurately determined using just a high quality accelerometer.‚ heading comes from using the accelerometer to find the gravity vector (i.e. ‚Äúdown‚Äù), then translating the three-axis magnetometer to get heading in the horizontal axes.‚ calculations under these conditions are fairly trivial.‚ however, once the ahrs begins to move through space these calculations no longer apply.‚ as an example, think of the three axis accelerometer on an ahrs that is tossed into the air.‚ since it is in free flight, all axes on the accelerometer will read exactly zero.‚ thus, both pitch and roll are undefined, and the magnetometer output cannot be translated to the horizontal plane.‚ sensor fusion algorithms use these two sensors plus a three axis gyroscope to form the solutions. our ahrs implementation, the ssahrs, uses an advanced quaternion based sensor fusion algorithm to continue the solution as the pitch reaches 90‚∞. ‚ platform motion is tracked without singularity.‚ quaternion processing is unnecessary in applications where the pitch is limited in range, such as marine vessels and non-aerobatic aircraft.‚ in these cases the simpler euler angles approach may be used.‚ the ssahrs is optimized for low power which makes it suitable for battery powered applications such as human wearable sensors and unmanned vehicles. a user may communicate with our ssahrs in one of three ways. uart: the ssahrs contains a standard 3.3v universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter connection.‚ through-holes are located on the board for transmit and receive connections.‚ flow control is not implemented. usb: the ssahrs contains a micro usb port for communicating with a personal computer over a virtual serial port.‚ the pc may communicate using a terminal program (such as hyperterminal or putty) or any programming language that allows access to the pc serial port. bluetooth: we have developed a bluetooth-enabled daughterboard with the same circuit board footprint as the ssahrs that links to the ssahrs uart lines.‚ this daughterboard communicates using the serial port class bluetooth connection.‚ it can communicate with either the bluetooth dongle we have developed or other bluetooth devices.‚ we have successfully tested our prototype with android smart phones. ‚ applications for the sensor and potential use: biomedical application and kinesiology human motion measurements and 3d character animation 3d motion tracking for games and virtual reality model planes, unmanned vehicles ‚ and robotics applications navigation and dead-reckoning ‚ applications camera and antenna stabilization sensor fusion algorithm operation: below is a flow chart showing the flow of the mems sensor signals used in ssahrs. ‚ the design is optimized to reduce sensors noise to maximize performance.‚ note that two mems gyroscopes are used in the ssahrs.‚ the purpose of this is twofold: 1) improve the gyro‚Äôs vibration immunity over that of a single gyro and 2) help remove biases that may present in any of the gyro‚Äôs three axes. prototype circuitry our prototype ssahrs device exhibits the following characteristics. electrical specs the ssahrs shall be supplied with a source between 3.6v and 9v.‚ it will draw approximately 50 ma. communications with the ssahrs are accomplished in one of two ways: either through a usb-based virtual serial port or through standard uart connections.‚ ‚ in either case, the communication protocol is 115.2 kbaud with eight data bits, one stop bit and no parity bits.‚ communication with the uart is non inverted (idle high) at 3.3v signal levels. mechanical specs the ssahrs is a 2.5 gram, 0.6 square inch circuit board containing electronic components on both sides.‚ four mounting holes secure the board in the host system.‚ the holes are sized for a #2 socket cap head screw with 0.14‚Äù head, such as shown below.‚ spacers or standoffs used with the ssahrs should have an outer diameter of no more than 0.14‚Äù. the four mount holes are located on the corners of a 0.6‚Äù square.‚ communications with the uart are handled with four pins of a standard 0.1‚Äù pitch header.‚ the diagram below provides a complete mechanical drawing of the ssahrs. communication interface a number of configuration commands will be implemented in the ssahrs.‚ they are sent through the same usb/uart that is used to extract the data.‚ the majority of them will be related to calibration of the device.‚ there will also be commands to set bluetooth parameters, default orientation (translate xyz axes so that any desired mounting orientation produces pitch = roll = 0) and others. a red/green/blue light emitting diode (led) is located on the top side of the ssarhs circuit board.‚ this will be used to provide feedback to the user regarding the current state of operation.‚ the exact details of how the led will be used have yet to be determined.‚ description of calibration the acceleration, magnetic field and rotation sensors in the ssahrs are all microelectromechanical systems (mems) devices.‚ these consist of real mechanical systems and sensing electronics fabricated in silicon, similar to the manufacturing process for typical integrated circuits.‚ while silicon manufacturing is quite precise, a number of different characteristics result in variations from one silicon wafer to the next or from one region of a silicon wafer to another.‚ these result in differences in performance characteristics from one mems device to another.‚ in addition, all mechanical systems and sensing electronics will exhibit some degree of temperature dependence, resulting in non-ideal behavior. all of these sources of error get added together and ultimately result in increased error mean (bias) and standard deviation (noise).‚ the goal of calibration is to remove these effects and reduce the system bias and noise. the figure below shows a commonly accepted way of describing coefficients that can help correct for the main sources of error in each of the three mems devices.‚ bias: this is the most significant source of error.‚ in the presence of zero driving force (example: a gyroscope undergoing no rotation), sensors which are sampled many times will still produce a non-zero average result.‚ the b parameters correct for this. gain: assuming that the sensor produces data that is linear with what it is sensing (which is a good approximation), there will be some error in the slope of the linear relationship.‚ the s parameters correct for this. cross-axis: in theory, the x, y, and z axes are perfectly orthogonal to each other.‚ another way of saying this is that the x axis is 90 degrees off from y, and both x and y are 90 degrees off from z.‚ in practice, there may be deviation from this.‚ the m parameters are experimentally generated and correct for cross-axis error. in practice the majority of error can be removed by correcting for the inherent sensor bias.‚ the ssahrs is factory calibrated to remove these biases.‚ algorithms for generating the gain and cross-axis correction coefficients as well as instructions for uploading them will be provided with the ssahrs documentation package. accelerometer calibration over temperature is accomplished with piecewise linear approximation of the sensor offset.‚ offset is measured in the factory at room temperature.‚ hot and cold temperatures are then extrapolated to generate offset for each axis as a function of temperature. magnetometer calibration is accomplished upon installation in the target system (drone aircraft, camera stabilizer, etc.) by rotating around a circle to remove hard iron (ferrous metal) and soft iron (electromagnetic field) effects. the sensor collects magnetic field data and calculates calibration coefficients automatically. ‚ details for this procedure will be provided in the final documentation package. factory calibration prior to delivery the ssahrs will be calibrated for the most significant sources of error contributing to pitch, roll, and yaw inaccuracies: accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope sensor bias offsets bx, by, bz .‚ appropriate values will be programmed into sensor nonvolatile memory and provided with included calibration documentation. user calibration accurate calibration of the magnetic sensor necessitates in-situ calibration.‚ geomagnetic fields are significantly disrupted by the presence of nearby ferrous metals and by any electromagnetic fields.‚ a common source of error-inducing electromagnetic fields is electrical current traveling through unbalanced (i.e. non-coaxial) wire in the vicinity of the magnetometer.‚ the factory calibration can remove any error in the sensor chip and ssahrs, but it is up to the user to calibrate out effects of the system in which the ssahrs is installed.‚ the procedure for performing this calibration will be clearly provided in the ssahrs documentation. in addition to these error sources, the user may also calibrate each sensor in the ssahrs for cross-axis error ( mx, my, mz ) and gain factor ( sx, sy, sz ).‚ though these error sources are minor in comparison to the bias errors, they still do contribute to the overall system error.‚ the documentation will describe how to perform these calibrations. the ssahrs is also set up to be calibrated for temperature.‚ a piecewise linear approximation is used at three temperatures: hot, room temperature, and cold.‚ the precise values of the hot and cold temperatures are not critical, but it is suggested that they be at or beyond the temperature extremes that the ssahrs will see in your particular application.‚ documentation will describe the procedures. bluetooth link for applications requiring wireless connectivity with ssahrs boards we have developed a bluetooth daughterboard with the same footprint that stacks underneath the sensor board.‚ shown below is a solid model of the assembled ssahrs and bluetooth daughterboard. ‚ ‚ power is supplied to the two open holes in the bluetooth (bottom) board.‚ upon powerup the ssahrs checks to see if a ssahrscom board is present.‚ if it is, it fully configures the bluetooth connection. communication with it is through a bluetooth-equipped smart phone.‚ our prototype has been successfully tested with android-based smart phones.‚ if we achieve our stretch goal (mentioned below) we will provide android source code to get you started writing your own interface apps.‚ we have yet to investigate communications with ios devices, though our team has experience writing apps for the iphone.‚ ‚ production timeline delivery of the ssahrs device is projected for september, 2014. the design team has already put significant effort into development of the prototype, with the following work left to complete

 i want to leave the world a better place for our children. i want to use less fossil fuels. and i want to find ways to grow more food in small spaces like suburban backyards. and i want to tell the world about it so everyone can do it; it takes a village! last winter i discovered jean pain, a revolutionary french activist in the 1970's who designed a system that made methane gas and heated water using nothing but composting. his piles were epic- over 50 tons and stayed hot for over 18 months. i want to see if a slightly smaller scale pile is possible and can be replicated in today's american suburbs. i have built a 10,000# pile of material and buried two steel drums in it. i would like to produce enough methane gas to test the system by flaring it off, and then focus on producing 120 degree water at the rate of about 3-4 gallons per minute. why? i want to install a compost hot water system - very similar to a solar hot water system- where the heat from a large compost pile is transferred to the water in our domestic hot water system to significantly reduce our natural gas use. then, this winter i would also like to plumb this heat into a water : air heat exchanger to space heat our suburban home. the pile i have built is a proof of concept - and it is awesome. however, to install this into my home and start telling the world about it, i will need some help buying proper materials to see how much potential this idea really has. new water pump: $100 pex tubing: $150 heat exchanger: $150 plumbing and incidentals: $100 the first week i wrote about the methane midden on www.onestraw.wordpress.com over 10,000 people read about it. the methane midden is so inspiring because it will produce hot water and space heating as well as over 3000#s of compost every 6 months as it sequesters carbon and heals our soils. in a pinch, it can be reconfigured to produce methane gas in times of crisis. best of all? no fancy materials or skills needed. if you can screw in a garden hose, drive a pitchfork and are savy enough to plug in a water pump - you can do this! the world needs simple solutions to our big problems as we search for a transitional culture to a more sustainable future. help me fill in the gaps, prove the concept, and spread the word by pledging to help me make this happen. be the change! faq

 **update**:‚ thanks to you, we successfully raised $10,000 in one week!‚ we are incredibly thankful and humbled by your generous donations :) with more momentum comes bigger goals. so we'd like to set a new funding goal of $40,000 and reveal our next project, a perfect compliment to the farm of the future and valhalla's mission to make communal sustainable living mainstream. introducing the 'the dome' -- a 33ft greenhouse hybrid of geodesic dome and earthship architecture: click here to read more about 'the dome' we're also adding some fun bonuses for different levels of funding. (we're excited to do the rap video!) -------- ( traduction fran„ßais ) we are valhalla -- a group of people dedicated‚ to making sustainable communal living mainstream and inspiring people to help create the beautiful world our hearts tell us is possible. we live in a time of extremes. technology has enabled us to either cause great harm or make tremendous strides. we want to make that choice an easy one, so we've launched a project that will do just that. we are creating a prototype of the farm of the future : a 100% off-the-grid greenhouse that produces vegetables, fruits and fish year-round, all in an automated way that requires very little maintenance. this model sounds expensive, but it's actually very affordable ($4,000 to $6,000) and will pay for itself within 3-7 years just from the food it produces. our unique and innovative design combines three of the most promising technologies for a sustainable future: ‚ earthships, aquaponics and passive solar greenhouses . aquaponics is a symbiotic system incorporating fish and plants that automates the production of a large amount of diverse food. passive solar greenhouses capitalize on the cycle of the sun to maximize heat and solar gain, even in a freezing cold climate. earthships are sustainable structures designed and developed by michael reynolds. this technology enables the greenhouse to be 100% off-the-grid by using passive ventilation, geothermal heating, water collection and renewable energy. it also allows the greenhouse to be made at an affordable price using recycled materials. we want to show that sustainable living is not only possible, but also the cheaper and easier‚ way to live .‚ can you imagine walking into your greenhouse, smelling the fresh basil, and picking your own lettuce, tomatoes and avocado for tonight's dinner?‚ what about doing all of this in the middle of winter? this could be your reality. this technology exists today , and will grow exponentially once it becomes mainstream. this is why it is our goal to bring easy, healthy, green food production into the cultural forefront and pave the way towards a sustainable future. we're building the first prototype in montreal, canada on our 60 acre valhalla community. the greenhouse will be available to visit by the public, along with the other earthships being built on the land this summer. this community will be a shining beacon for sustainable communal living. the funds from this kickstarter will go towards the materials to build the first prototype of the farm of the future. this includes glass, wood, concrete, plumbing, clay and plaster. any excess funds will go towards building additional prototypes. we want to nail down this design as tightly as possible before releasing it to the public. we will film and document the entire process so that we can then provide the plans at a very affordable price so that everyone can access them. any proceeds will go towards creating an organization that will travel and build these greenhouses for those unable to build them independently. by supporting our project you play an integral role in the shift towards the sustainable future of our collective dreams. help us push this revolution forward by contributing and spreading the word! for more info, visit: valhallamovement.com &amp; solutionera.com 
 introduction to spicy hello,‚ i am ed, and i am the creator of spicy schematics ( http://ischematics.com ), the first tablet-based circuit schematic design tool for electrical engineers! i am an experienced electrical and software engineer, having worked for companies such as baxter healthcare, honeywell, intel, and pelagic pressure systems, as a programmer, electrical design engineer, product engineer, and embedded systems engineer; a combined total of roughly 10 years of practical experience with product, software, hardware and systems design. ‚ i am currently a grad student working on a phd in electrical engineering. ‚ last year i was given an ipad as a gift, and i immediately had an idea ... i noticed that although many people were walking around with ipads and other tablets, virtually noone uses them for engineering work! ‚ i realized that while they would love to be able to, there simply were no engineering applications that could meet the demanding needs of real design work, while at the same time making optimal use of the mobile platforms. ‚ until now ...‚ i quickly got to work and created spicy schematics . ‚ spicy is the first program to make use of the mobile platform for electronic circuit design, allowing designers the freedom of mobility, while providing the power of a practical schematic capture program. ‚ spicy has all the basic features you would expect, plus some powerful extras like the unique spicy schematics online circuit library , where users can store and share designs with co-workers, friends, and others. ‚ my vision spicy is truly unique, and truly powerful. ‚ it is the only program of its kind out there today, and there is so much more it could do. ‚ i see spicy as the future of tablet-based circuit design. ‚ surely we can agree that someday engineers, professor, students, and hobbyists will use tablet's to design circuits, and be able to quickly create new technology and implement their own creative vision on tablets, but why not today? ... why not now? ‚ i say we can, and i can make it happen. ‚ there are a list of features i want to add to make spicy not just the best schematic capture program available today, but for years to come. ‚ i want spicy to be a practical tool enabling engineers to forget about all the complexities of standard pc-based software, and focus on design, and focus on ideas. ‚ i want to give professors what they want - to be able to offer modern, relevant, cutting edge electrical engineering lessons utilizing mobile technologies to engage and excite students. ‚ finally, i want to offer engineers, students, and professors alike, the tool of all tools for circuit design, with one-tap sharing, part/library creation, netlist generation, and much more, so that 20 years from now spicy is synonymous with circuit design itself. ‚ this is possible, and i can make it happen. ‚ how you can help with pledged funds i will be able to support my team of developers, myself as the director of the project, to implement the features that will take spicy to the next level. ‚ check out the list of great rewards at each pledge level, and i thank you for your support. ‚ let's give engineers the freedom to be creative, the freedom of mobility, ... let's give them spicy schematics! faq

 www.facebook.com/leeantimicrobial background‚ on a well-known problem: have you ever been near a stranger when they coughed or sneezed?‚ have you ever touched something they have touched, maybe without realizing, like a door handle, a counter top, or a touch screen?‚ germs have always been a part of our environment.they are in the air we breathe, as well as on‚ all of the surfaces we touch in our homes, schools, work, or while shopping.‚ every day we are exposed to new germs by the people we meet and in the places we visit.‚ every day we risk picking these germs up, spreading them to every person and place that we visit, and bringing them home.‚ and every day, we and the people we care about are at risk of getting sick from new germs ‚Äì sometimes just a cold, sometimes the flu, and sometimes something much more dangerous. dhp does so much more than air purifiers can do . while air purifiers simply take air in, process it, and improve ‚Äúair quality‚Äù, dhp technology goes well‚ beyond these standard capabilities.‚ dhp technology actually makes the air self-disinfecting and self-cleaning , so the air does not have to go through a device to get disinfected or cleaned.‚ and because the air itself can disinfect, it can also disinfect all of the surfaces it touches, something an air purifier simply cannot do. our story: lams founders developed the technology to make dhp from the air itself and to add it to the air in amounts hundreds of times less in each bit of air than we have in each same sized bit of lung moisture. dhp technology continuously disinfects germs floating in the air and on every surface that the air touches.‚ our lungs naturally produce dhp, "dilute hydrogen peroxide" as part of our respiratory defense system. lams founders realized that dhp could be made without‚ mixing it with water, and then released into the air in amounts hundreds of times less in each bit of air than we have in each same size bit of lung moisture.‚ dhp technology continuously kills germs floating in the air and germs lurking on every surface that the air touches.‚ ‚ this is a major advance over air purification technology . air purifiers only affect air while it flows through the machine. they can't kill germs in the air outside the machine anywhere in the room and they can't kill germs on surfaces anywhere the air can reach. dhp technology is also a major advance over vaporized hydrogen peroxide technologies that produce a mist or steam from liquid hydrogen peroxide solutions.‚ water actually gets in the way when hydrogen peroxide is used to kill germs.‚ if you use hydrogen peroxide mixed with water, or droplets of vaporized liquid hydrogen peroxide, you have to use enough hydrogen peroxide, a whole lot actually, just to make it work with all of the water mixed in.‚ dhp is not mixed with water and is the driest form of hydrogen peroxide possible, and doesn't have to overcome extra water to disinfect.‚ after years of research and development, we have been awarded patents for dhp technology in the united states and in nine other countries ; with more patents pending.‚ we also asked the epa to review our technology and they told us that we could go to market immediately under the same regulations that apply to air purifiers. all along, we have continued to improve our technology and to test‚ it in accredited labs to make sure it is ready for the public.‚ ‚ as our technology evolved, we contracted manufacturers to develop and produce specific components. nearly all had to be created to meet‚ lams' exacting specifications. how does dhp technology work?‚ ‚ ‚ we've all seen drug store hydrogen peroxide bubble and fizz.‚ when it does this, the hydrogen peroxide is breaking down into water and oxygen.‚ well, if hydrogen peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen, then it can be made from water and oxygen, and we have humidity and oxygen in the air.‚ the only trick was to figure out a way to take minute amounts of humidity and oxygen from the air to create dhp.‚ that's what we did , and it was such a new and revolutionary thing that we've been awarded patents around the world for it. ‚ so how much greener can you get?‚ use a little bit of air to make something that our own lungs make and use, then put it into the air where it disinfects the whole area, and then breaks back down into the same humidity and oxygen you used to make it.‚ the dhp only exists for a short time, but the dhp generator continuously makes new dhp to replace the dhp that is used up. ‚ how much simpler to use can it be?‚ we are making dhp from the air itself so there are no solutions or bottles to buy and use.‚ you turn it on and let it run without worrying about it.‚ we simply recommend that the catalyst be replaced every three to six months. but the question is, ‚Äú how does this make your life better ?‚Äù this is accomplished‚ several‚ ways : we should mention that dhp technology does not use germicidal uv light that can harm furnishings and dhp technology does not produce ozone .‚ in fact, dhp technology actually reduces ozone from pollution. today we are almost ready to bring dhp technology to you; the only thing that remains is to set up production.‚ we are finalizing negotiations with a contract manufacturer, but we still have to have the injection molds made to produce the devices, and take care of other manufacturing set-up costs. that is why we are using kickstarter to reach out to those of you who have been asking us all along how soon you can get dhp technology for your homes and to those of you just learning about dhp technology to assist in setting up manufacturing. we hope that you are as excited about dhp technology as we are, and‚ lams thanks you ‚ for your support by selecting an award level and making a contribution.‚ you can even choose a dhp device from our first production run as a backer award. our promise: lams "lee antimicrobial solutions llc" was born from duty and service.‚ our founder, and the inventor of dhp technology, is a west point graduate.‚ our company motto is the definition of duty taught at west point:‚ ‚Äúdo the right thing, at the right time, for the right reasons.‚Äù what this means is that you can count on lams to offer products that can not only make your life better, but are safe, effective, and comply with regulations and market standards, all while being cost sensitive. welcome to lams "lee antimicrobial solutions llc"‚ and evrest, the‚ disinfection specialists‚ of the world. we are ready for full scale production with your support. produced by a team of west point graduates and scientists in new york, new jersey, ohio, colorado and texas engineered to be mass-manufactured final designs built and tested using multiple generations of prototypes testing included a wide range of catalyst formulation options to obtain optimum performance testing included a limited run of alpha prototype units patented in the us and nine other countries worldwide (so far) why kickstarter: today we are almost ready to bring dhp technology to you.‚ funds raised from the campaign will be used to purchase the final tooling and manufacturing, and to place the first order for production.‚ the evrest device requires very precise machining due to its exact tolerances - this tooling is expensive.‚ your support of the lams kickstarter campaign gives us the ability to get evrest by lams into your hands and your homes or wherever you need us. you will not just be getting a great product that will improve the air quality and environment where you live or work. you will also be helping us reach others whose lives will be improved by devices made from the tools you and kickstarter have funded.‚ funding: if the goal is not met, all donated funds will be returned, and this limited production run will not occur. lams has been featured in the following publications 
 more testing should produce an upward lift greater than 100% making my device a serious candidate for the little known and little contested $1.3 million gode gravity award . the requirements to win this award are:‚ "a 20 gram heavy device or the assembly itself, is required to float freely at least 1 minute at a minimum distance of 10 cm from any surface." most scientist have accepted einstein‚Äôs idea that mass can warp space. this ‚Äústrange‚Äù idea has been supported by abundant observation. newton‚Äôs ‚Äústrange‚Äù idea that mass can attract other mass has also been supported

power to make the whole universe revolve around it in a 24 hours. ‚ after a lot of pain to dissenters this strange idea was finally replaced with the idea of ‚ heliocentrism which seemed more physical and less mysterious. this lesson from the past seems to be lost on today's scientists who seem once again to be‚ championing an unphysical idea that is supported by widespread observation. ‚ the unthinking acceptance of the observationally supported "strange" and mysterious ‚ idea that mass can warp space or that it can attract other mass has resulted in a preposterous universe where 95% of it is little understood. ‚ this situation does not call for hordes of experimenters spending billions keeping the ancient basic mysterious hypothesis in place. ‚ what it calls for is a lone self-financed theorists working for years the attic trying to come up with an idea that would replace the idea mass can attract other mass or warp space.‚ the gravity theory that i am trying to promote has the fundamental hypothesis that gravitational phenomena is the result of‚ transferred‚ momentum produced by "stopped wind" a term which will be described. we already know a lot about momentum and the dynamics of wind. ‚ thus the fundamental idea of my theory is further interpretable in terms of familiar physics. this theory has led to an experiment ‚ where a seven pound test mass was observed to lose 99% of its weight. neither einstein's fundamental premise that mass can warp space nor newton's fundamental premise that mass can attract other mass can comprehend this easily repeatable table top experiment. experiments with similar results can be found here and here ‚ and here. ‚ my patent pending device which i call a reactionless thermal drive is getting quite close to being able to levitate. ‚ the winning of the gode award will further insure the reduction to practice of this promising invention. ‚ since we live in a world where anti-gravity is thought impossible, it is hard to get funding for this invention. ‚ thus support from kickstarters is all important and critical. my device when fully developed should have certain advantages over the jet and the rocket. ‚ the‚ jet and the rocket ‚ produce a deafening amount of noise and the rocket large amounts of exhaust. ‚ my device on the other hand is silent and reactionless. ‚ furthermore, when it is fully developed ,‚ it should employ‚ comparatively‚ fewer moving parts than the jet. ‚ anyone who can understand why the cold parcel of air blows towards the warm one can understand my stopped wind theory of gravity below is a picture of a sea breeze which in the morning blows from the sea towards the land. in the morning the sun has a much harder time heating up the sea than it does the land. ‚ thus the parcel of air above the sea is colder than the parcel of air above the land. ‚ because it is more dense, cold air has a greater‚ air pressure than warm air. ‚ because warm air is less dense, it‚ ‚ has lower pressure than cold air. it is this pressure difference that makes the wind to blow. ‚ what my device does is take a container of air and using a hot source make one part of it hot and one part of it cold with a cold source. ‚ this idea is illustrated in the picture below. ‚ ‚ the cold air at the bottom part of he container will have a greater pressure than the hot air at the top of the container. ‚ the dense molecules of the cold air will want to move towards the less dense hot molecules at the top of the container similar to what happens between two parcels of air with different temperature. ‚ however, little easily observed air movement will occur. ‚ instead of moving an observable distance the colder molecules will only be able to transfer momentum to the upper less dense warmer molecules. ‚ it is this one-way transfer of momentum of the cold molecules on the warmer less dense molecules that i believe constitutes the gravitational force that we are all so familiar with on the surface of the earth. ‚ in the picture below an suspended upside down aluminum pot is shown which an about one half of an inch of it lies submerged in a pan of ice water. ‚ this makes the air in the pot just above the ice water cold and thus increases it over all pressure. ‚ at the top of the pot a 820 w butane torch is pointed towards the pot. ‚ this applied heat makes the air just inside the top part of the pot hot. ‚ this has the effect of decreasing the over all pressure of this upward layer of hot air. this butane torch is fired up for about 200 seconds as is indicated by the initially decreasing red line. this red line measures the change of weight of the aluminum pot over time in newtons. ‚ its drop in ~200 seconds indicates that an upward force ‚ equivalent to 90% of the 3.3 pound or 1.4 kg weight of the aluminum pot was produced inside the pot.‚ the sun's gravity as stopped wind that can only transfer momentum the sun can be thought of as a ball of gas. ‚ the direction of the gravitational force inside it ‚ points towards its center. ‚ the temperature of the gas in its outer parts is all much lower than the temperature of the gas at its center. ‚ thus. at least initially, the pressure of the gas in its outer parts should be much higher than the pressure of the gas at its center. ‚ this higher pressure in the sun's outer parts will make the outer particles ‚ want to move towards its center. ‚ however, there is little space for these center moving particles to move. ‚ instead of moving what they will do is to transfer momentum that will be directed towards the sun's center. ‚ this center-directed-transferred momentum can be thought of as what constitutes the sun's gravitational force.‚

 btps! will be the first tire-pressure-sensor on the market specially designed for bicycles and e-bikes. it is a very small and robust, battery driven device which fits directly into your bike tire. it communicates wirelessly with your smart phone, smart watch or your bike computer. currently no product on the market provides the opportunity to measure the bike tire pressure in real-time and with this high level of comfort. check-out news on www.ibtps.com thank's to your support we got featured in many, many blogs, newsletters, ... keep on spreading the word to make this product successful! ------------------- main benefits increased safety: today, all new passenger cars have to have an installed tire pressure monitoring system to warn drivers when the tire pressure is below (or above) a defined pressure limit. these systems do not work on bicycles and e-bikes. btps! will close this gap. higher mileage range and longer battery life-time: let's assume you are not aware that the tire pressure on your e-bike droped to 3 bar (45 psi) instead of 4 bar (60 psi). this missing one bar will reduce the mileage range more than 30%. with btps! you will be warned if the tire pressure is below limit. therefore it is easy for you to achieve higher mileage and a less frequent recharging of the expensive li-battery. less risk of damaged tires: btps! will help you to increase tire life time to a maximum. no more damaged sidewalls or snake-bites due to a tire pressure which dropped accidently low. additional training data: typically during your training session you record heart rate, speed, eventually cadence and power? did you never wonder why you need more power to keep speed compared to the last training session? never wondered about how fast the tire pressure drops during a 6 hours training session? with btps! you can monitor the pressure of the bike tires during training. features at a glance measures the tire pressure in real time bluetooth low energy (bt4.0) or ant+ compatible transmits and displays the tire pressure on your smart device pressure range from zero to 12 bar / 174 psi &gt; 2yrs of battery life time more than 20'000 hrs of standby time (not riding); more than 200 hrs of operation time (riding) available for all rim diameters compatible devices btps! uses the bluetooth low energy (btle or bt4.0) and the ant+ wireless protocol. there are many devices like smart phones, smart watches and bike computers from popular brands, which are using this protocol to interface with different kind of sensors like heart rate, speed, cadence and power. the below listed devices are our favorites where we either have shown that they work with btps! or where we are in contact with the manufacturer to get btps! integrated in one of the next firmware releases: smartphones iphone 3 / 4 (only with ant+ fisica sensor interface) iphone 4s / 5 sony ericcson xperia / arc samsung galaxy s3 htc one (s, x, xi), htc one, htc one s, htc desire c, desire v, desire x lg electronics optimus 4x hd motorola razr maxx alcatel one touch bike computers the below listed bike computers have a built in ant+ communication interface. but in order to interface with the btps! a firmware update is required. we are in close contact with the manufacturers to get this done as soon as possible: garmin edge 800 / 500 vdo gp7 bryton 50 / 40 / 35 / 21 / 20 / 20+ smart watches are new and pretty cool! the below listed smart watches offer a bluetooth 4.0 interface and have an open platform to connect to btps! there is a clear market trend indicating that the number of smart watches on the market will skyrocket. we will be a part of this and will implement the btps! pebble watch - today only for development; the watch is not available on the market, yet i'm watch - available on the market (firmware open-source but not distributed yet) metawatch (btps! is implemented) stratos watch how will the funds be used? we have already committed in designing the solution and making the working prototypes. these prototypes have demonstrated all of the critical functions i.e. durability, simplicity of installation, highest accuracy, fast pressure reading, rf communication with ant+ and bluetooth 4.0, lowest power consumption, working apps for iphone, android and smart-watches. your funding will help us to make more systems in order to verify the final design and also to order the tooling for the housing as well as a larger series of circuit boards and electronic components. your funds will also be used to add further functionalities to our apps like a tire database with predefined pressure limits for specific tires, user warning and alarm level setting, etc. you are very welcome to send us your suggestions. our special: btps! for tube tires we are fully aware that the actual version of btps! only appeals to those who have or plan to have tube-less tires on their bikes or pedelecs. all others use tire-tubes and need a solution for those. here it is: the btps! "sensor-patch" - it consists of a tire-tube with mounted sensor patch to which a controller unit with microcontroller, radio frequency communication and battery is attached. we pre-assemble the sensor patch on a high quality tire tube. the controller unit is connected to the sensor patch. the tube is then simply mounted on the rim as a normal tire-tube. all performance specifications are the same as for the above described btps!: real-time measurement, ant+/bt4.0 compatible, communication to smart devices, etc. we do have first pre-prototypes running and the results are very promising. we do need to invest more work on the sensor patch in order to engineer a optimal solution. as material scientist, chris is the guy to go for this and has many options in mind how this could be done. we would like to share our excitement about that product idea with you and offer some beta-testing systems (see corresponding pledge). if these go away, we definitively will get a boost to drive this solution further. the team chris@ibtps.com - the inventor. he wants his invention to be used by everyone. chris holds a ms in physics and a phd in material science from the swiss federal institute of technology and moved to san diego for his post-doc. in his other life, he works in the field of mems, smart micro sensors and medical device development. he has a track record of almost 20 years of successful product development. his products won several awards. andre@ibtps.com - the electronics guy. there is no electronic circuit on earth he is not capable to make it work. andre holds a ms in electronic engineering and spends most nights and weekends on having great ideas in electronics. his track record in electronic circuitry and wireless communication product development for industries like aeronautics and medical covers more than 20 years. t-shirts manufacturing plan step 1a: injection molding: it will take about 6 weeks to get the tooling and first injection molded btps! housings from our supplier. step 1b: electronics and microcontroller firmware: we will need 3 to 4 weeks to have a first series of fully assembled printed circuit boards ready. while waiting for the final circuit boards from our supplier we will update the firmware in order to make it robust and ready for the product launch. step 1b runs in parallel to step 1a. step 1c: apps for smart devices: we will make a new version of all apps and implement features we have already in mind. step 1c is done by our partner and runs in parallel to step 1a and 1c. step 2: testing of fully assembled device: the devices which will come out of step 1 will be fully tested following a detailed verification plan. we will share this plan with you in order to make sure we have covered all. this step is very important and will ensure the design is sound and the specifications are fully met. if everything works as expected we can go for the production run. we plan 3 weeks for step 2. step 3: shipping of fully tested device: assembly, final testing and shipment of the btps! will take about 2 weeks and shipping will start beginning may - in time for the bike-season 2013 
 the idea for myhue originated from my work environment. our office is primarily one room with a large number of employees sharing the space. as the number of employees using smart phones increased, the number of audio notifications has grown tremendously. we all constantly hear everyone's beeps, music, engines racing, and other notification sounds as the endless texts, emails, weather alerts, and alarms come in throughout the day. ‚ i thought it would be much better to have a visual display on my desk and not need the audio. i knew my coworkers would be much happier as well. using myhue, each time i receive a notification, myhue displays a color preselected for that particular notification. with my settings, blue means i have a text, red is a new e mail and white is a phone call. i realized myhue would be great in many other environments. my wife works in a very quiet office where the sound of an incoming text is a distraction to others. she also spends a lot of time with customers on the phone.‚ she does not want customers to hear her cell phone notifications being heard in the background. ‚ myhue sits on her desk and she instantly knows she has a notification without disturbing anyone. the same goes for a noisy environment. when i am in my wood working shop, i cannot hear an incoming text or call, but myhue lets me know i have one. i took the idea a step further and created multiple myhues. ‚ this works great when i am at home. if my phone is in the bedroom, i will receive a notification when i am in the living room, kitchen or back patio - anywhere i have a myhue. the myhue app is in beta on google play store join beta testing here https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/myhue.‚ myhue is for android devices running version 4.3 and above. ‚ ‚ ‚ the myhue is available in two sizes with several lens designs to select from.we are also offering customization on the lenses of up to 15 characters.you can add your company name, your name, initials, etc.this is at no additional charge.as we proceed, additional lens designs will become available.we value your input.give us your ideas, and we will see if we can make it happen.additional designs will be added periodically.when the project is funded, you will have the option of 3 available lenses including the customization option with each myhue purchase. ‚ the myhue with charger is currently available in one style.we will be adding additional designs as we progress.

 curuba is... curuba is an open-source and open-hardware home automation system. the project aims at creating an affordable, complete home automation system featuring quality comparable to existing products on the market. the system is designed with a modular approach, so that it is easily customizable. it uses the well-known wi-fi wireless technology to communicate information. also, in order to deliver support for the project, to transfer knowledge and to share documentation, we are trying to build a web community around the project.‚ product description since we started the project curuba has evoled. the first prototype was big and costly. it was a single circuit board with everything on it only made to start programming the hardware. the second prototype was made to be modular, smaller and cheaper. it was composed of two boards, each one dedicated to a specific purpose. these two prototypes are functional but we wanted to do better so we decided to design a third one. the third prototype (the one we are offering you in the pledge) is the smallest and cheapest we could make up to now. the control module can communicate via wi-fi and execute the commands received.‚ its main purpose is to control the application module that will be on top of it. it will be reused for any application.(the ti cc3000 wi-fi chip supports: 802.11b/g, wpa2, wpa, wep and open). following are the two application modules designed as of now. first comes the high power module, dedicated to control simple on/off high power appliances, such as ac power outlets. second comes the light, or low power, module, intended to control low power appliances and create a dimmer for light control purposes. the control and application-specific modules are then simply stacked up together to form a complete module. how to install it * : as you will notice when reading the user guide available on our website,‚ installing curuba can be done by anyone, in four main steps:‚ 1.‚ download the‚ curuba server ‚ and install it on the intended platform (raspberry pi or pc) and configure it; 2. configure the ‚ curuba modules ‚ with an usb connexion to the curuba server; 3. connect the curuba modules in the electrical enclosure of the device you want to control, such as a switch or a power outlet;‚ 4. connect your computer, tablet or smartphone to the server using the curuba web-based application.‚ have fun!‚ * it is important to mention that since no certification process has been done as of now, you may install the modules and use them at your own risks. the modules have been tested, we but can not give any insurance concerning the prototype's security. for precise instructions on the installation, please use the following link:‚ http://wiki.curuba.org/index.php?title=installation ‚ (the ‚ web site curuba.org is currently being update and will be completely finish in january) what you can do with it (as of now‚Ä¶)‚ ‚ - curuba can be used in parallel with an electrical switch to control in a three way configuration, featuring a dimmer function when controlling lights, or to control simple on/off high power appliances;‚ ‚ - curuba can control any device having a current consumption up to 12.5 a, under voltages reaching 120 vac. ‚ - curuba records the power consumption of each connected device. the application then shows useful statistics that can be consulted at anytime. this helps the user to efficiently monitor the operation of high energy consuming appliances in his house;‚ - the curuba application can be used with any of the following: iphone, ipod touch, android, blackberry, tablets and computers;‚ - curuba electrical modules have to be configured via a usb cable with the central server, in order to be able to connect to the wi-fi network. our code only support wpa2.this configuration has to be done once, before the installation of the modules. thus, curuba benefits from the security of the existing wi-fi network;‚ - the curuba hardware designs and software can be downloaded from our website. as already stated, the project is open-source and open-hardware.‚ team description:‚ we are a team of students in electrical and computer engineering, and we are currently finishing our degree. the project started a year ago as a university project. the goal was to create a low cost home automation system, completely open to the public. we met the initial goals faster than we though, so we decided to go further and do a kickstarter! we didn't want the project to end when we finish our degree, because we are all really motivated to make it bigger. we want the project to continue evolving until it reaches a marketable state.‚ we currently estimate the production cost of a whole module built to 61 $, but we want to make it lower.‚ we also need to go through a long and complicated certification process to ensure the safety of the modules when they are in use, so people can have an absolute faith in the product. this was kept in mind when doing the design, and many tests have already been made by the team in that way, but realizing the certification will still be very costly. it is important to mention that this will only apply to the modules we build and ship ourselves, since any modification that may be done to the design voids the whole certification process.‚ for developers for the people who want to participate in testing and developing curuba, the programming kit used is the msp-exp430g2 from texas instruments, which can be boughthere. following is a picture of an example setup that we use when developing: the i/o pins you will need to use are described on our website at the following link: http://curuba.org/supportdevelopment . ‚ online forum‚ ‚ an online forum has been created to serve several purposes:‚ - share information and ideas between members of the project‚Äôs web community;‚ - discuss of new features that could be added to the project;‚ - bring support to developers wanting to upgrade curuba;‚ - receive precious feedback from users and developers;‚ - share the code, electrical schematic, user guide, and any other information you need to know about the project. what comes next, if we collect enough money‚ ‚ 1. fulfil our engagements towards the project backers (see pledge description ‚ below); ‚ 2.‚ bring curuba up to north american electrical standards;‚ ‚ 3. continue the development of other useful features, based on the ideas, feedback and advices received from the web community;‚ ‚ 4. improve the communication protocols and secure the connections further.‚ ‚ * note that every new hardware features or software updates, may those be made by us or by any other developer, will be available on the web site, and as completely documented as the currently available features. pledge description‚ the curuba electrical module prototypes we will send you are tested and functional. we want you to become part of the project and help us find the problems and limitations of the modules. explore the possibilities of curuba, and give us your feedback! we ensure you that we will keep the promises made to the backers, whatever country they are from. we have seen many projects on kickstarter where the members didn‚Äôt always keep their promises, or wouldn‚Äôt answer correctly or shortly enough to the questions they were asked. we want you to know that your satisfaction is very important to us, and we want curuba to be associated with trustworthiness right from the start. if you choose the 4 curuba modules pledge, please mention how many of each application modules you want. for example: 2 light modules and 2 high power modules.‚ if you choose any pledge containing one or many curuba modules, please specify if you would like an epoxy coating to be added to cover the modules, for electrical insulation and thermal conduction. since the modules are sent as prototypes, if this isn't mentioned, no coating will be added. it is also important to mention that the coating is impossible to remove, so the hardware will be unaccessible forever.‚ addon rewards: for each curuba module you take, you can add 20$ to receive an additional curuba customized electrical wall plate. the software to install curuba is available on our website : ‚ http://curuba.org .‚ timeline here is a approximate planning we made to fulfill the pledges: receive the money form kickstarter in the beginning of january; order the modules from the manufacturer as soon as possible; receive the modules in the beginning of february; finish the modules assembly, configuration and testing by the end of february; pack and send the modules in march. considering the possible setbacks we might encounter, everyone should have received his rewards by the end of april, as promised. imagine with us as previously stated, the curuba platform is made so you can develop your own functionalities, such as: a watering system for your plants; a system to feed your animals from distance; opening your door when the mailman comes for a delivery, or when a technician comes for an installation; controlling your house's thermostat and programming its working schedule to save electricity. special thanks we would like‚ to specially thank people who volunteered to help us in this adventure:‚ elsa chiasson: for her help in the website's design, drafting and correction. alexandre gauvin: for his pictures of the team and the electrical modules. andr„©s salas: for filming and editing the video. and, of course, each and everyone of you guys from the kickstarter community who give us an enormous hand in continuing our project! thank you!! the curuba team. 
 hi, we're joel and anthony, owners of look shape . we want to build a framework for many types of avatar builders and we need your help .‚ even if you can't donate, we need your feedback! check out our demo at lookshape.com/avatar. ‚ we'd like to include over 500 pieces of art in robot avatar builder. from there, we will create an app for android and iphone (and maybe, but probably not, windows) phones.‚ once we have a working model, we will then be obligated to celebrate with beers. after recovery, we'll start right away on other avatar styles like monsters, aliens, and humans. they will always be free to build and download. you'll also be able to save your avatar into our database if you create an account. our hope is that you will help us take over the avatar world. if there is enough interest, we will also provide the source code and all of our dirty secrets on how we build the project. 
 check out the webpronews video of gooey search! *pledge $10 or more and receive both the ipad app and the firefox browser add-on! gooey overview like most people, google is our go-to search engine. from our extensive study of the mathematics of language, we found a great way to combine smart web bots and intelligent reading technology. our technology reads every google result, strips out the spam, and bubbles up only the best results along with the strongest concepts in a kinetic, gooey graph. instead of marketing tags, these concepts are discovered entities that empower you to interact with and explore google results like never before. gooey makes search fun and rewarding for kids of all ages. how will you use gooey? easy. launch the gooey app on your ipad or as an add-on in your firefox browser. all you have to do is type your search terms into the search bar (just like you would any google search). we issue your search to google but our smart bots literally check every result returned - verifying each link and reading each document for you. on the right side of the graphic user interface (gui for short) is gooey graph ‚Äì an alive, real-time network diagram of discovered concepts. just play with gooey graph by deleting or stacking concepts to quickly sort results and find what you need. the graphic below illustrates how you can play with the gooey graph on your ipad. (just use the mouse instead of your fingers if searching on gooey through firefox) isn‚Äôt search solved? not for us. we‚Äôve been working the challenge of exploratory search for several years. exploratory search is when you are looking for information but don‚Äôt really know enough about a subject to even build a good query. basically‚Ä¶ i know what i want, but can‚Äôt describe it, or‚ i‚Äôll know it when i see it! the super app ( gisterpro ) version of gooey is already helping professional researchers and analysts find stuff they would normally miss but it‚Äôs way too expensive to operate and overkill for the rest of us. crowdsource a cloud: gooey groups gooey is a super app that requires more than a few cycles to process a search ‚Äì a thousand results, the most google will return, is a lot of crawling and reading! the good news is we have a crowdsource deployment method that is a cool way to leverage excess bandwidth and cycles. by forming gooey groups, you pool the collective excess compute resources of friends and family to share the search workload in a secure, seamless and transparent fashion. for each gooey app, you get free gooey compute nodes to install on your desktop or laptop ‚Äì your ‚Äúalways on‚Äù pc - likely the pc you use to sync itunes with your ipad. groups of 10 or more will maximize gooey performance so search times and gooey graph generation are just a few seconds to complete. don‚Äôt worry, you won‚Äôt be alone as gooey scales up or if you don‚Äôt have many friends or family (we‚Äôre sorry). we‚Äôll have a smart cloud back end that optimizes search experience until broader groups are established. the path to gooeyness we have a clear path to launching the private beta this fall and releasing gooey by christmas. gisterpro is our working prototype and template for gooey. as we turn the complex gisterpro software into the gooey app, we‚Äôll be porting code to ios and adding a java library (so gooey is really gooey as you play with the gooey graph). also on our technology roadmap is the coding of the gooey groups backend distribution app. we‚Äôre already working on the open source gui api. thankfully, none of this work has any technology risk; all the heavy-lifting and gnashing of programmers‚Äô teeth is behind us! escape the filter bubble eli parsier did yeoman‚Äôs work uncovering and documenting something he calls the filter bubble. our data suggests that the filter bubble does indeed seem to have the unintended consequence of biasing search results. by parsing and distributing your search across many nodes through gooey groups, gooey neutralizes the filter bubble and returns to you unbiased results. benefits fun &amp; creative approach to search best results at top spam-free escape the filter bubble no tracking: private and secure search gooey groups keep search free gooey groups messaging encrypted and secure: complete privacy danke! gracias! merci! thank you! this is where you come in; your support is essential. your input and feedback throughout the private beta is critical to making gooey a great app! and your pledges make it possible for us to code and complete the work before us between now and christmas. all along the way, we‚Äôll keep you in the know with frequent, geek updates. we will complete the api so we can open up the gui to folks more creative than us ‚Äì that would be you. the gooey groups distributed app and port of gooey technology to ios optimized for the ipad will keep us very busy until the beta release this fall. we believe in the spirit of entrepreneurship and inventors like ourselves, therefore we are devoting 5% of our successful campaign earnings to the‚ kicking it forward campaign. to further support the kickstarter community, we are offering successful kickstarter projects ipad-related products as rewards for $100 level and up pledges‚Ä¶these are really cool! you can see the products at: http://www.gooey-search.com/kickstarter-rewards/ for further information, check out the below links: website | blog | twitter faq what about free in app purchases? gooey will never be done between normal patches, upgrades &amp; new features. some new features on the drawing board will be available for purchase from within the app after release. depending on the nature of the feature, we plan to provide in app purchases ranging from $.99 and up. at the $25 pledge level and up, kickstarters enjoy free in app features for forever. at the $10 level, in app features are free for the first 12 months after release. last updated: sat, apr 28 2012 6:29 pm edt privacy and anonymity are important to me, how can gooey help? gooey works on the same technology and approach that we‚Äôve successfully employed with gisterpro. the main difference is gisterpro is cloud-based and gooey is based around gooey groups that are in essence crowd-based clouds. during a typical gooey search, from google‚Äôs perspective, it sees many distributed queries but cannot attribute a given search to a single node or computer. your search is commanded from your device through encrypted communications and directs nodes in your gooey group to conduct discrete tasks that are encrypted and firewalled from a given node‚Äôs user: complete privacy and anonymity up and down the line. this approach assures that only your device has all the puzzle pieces and thus no one may track and report your searches. all open searches conducted through google, bing and others are traceable to individuals. by law, search engines are required to keep logs of all searches conducted. we believe it is important for people to have the option to control their data. gooey is a big step towards keeping your business, your business! last updated: sat, apr 28 2012 6:30 pm edt what makes gooey special? gooey has a cool graphic user interface (gui), granted. but guis are pretty easy compared to the non-trivial challenge of creating high-speed automatic reading algorithms for unstructured data. that‚Äôs the secret sauce that makes gooey tick. for those of you that are curious, gooey performs a latent semantic analysis (lsa) ‚Äìlike process on the data but without the high computational overhead normally associated with lsa. last updated: mon, may 14 2012 4:50 pm edt why are we building this? first, it is important for us to make available to everyone a technology that has changed our lives in wonderful ways we did not anticipate. we use gisterpro all the time to conduct searches (whether personal or work-related) when we really need to understand a subject domain or be assured that we are running to ground and finding honest information no matter where it resides in the hundreds of returns from a given search. so, all the time! we are also concerned about users maintaining control of their data - gooey returns control to you. we come from a pc gaming background and are big believers in bringing an element of entertainment to technical solutions. our experience suggests that cultural biases and habits of inefficiency can be eclipsed by making an experience just downright fun! thus our passion and enjoyment in bringing forth something cool, fun and really useful! last updated: mon, may 14 2012 4:50 pm edt how do we know the technology works? good question. the same core, proven technology that is used in gisterpro is the technology we secured for gooey‚Ä¶for the rest of us. last updated: mon, may 14 2012 4:50 pm edt how does it work? pretty well, actually. if you‚Äôre asking about the nuts-and-bolts deployment model, then you‚Äôd like to know that gooey will initially be an ipad app that requires you to also download and install an arbitrator app on your pc - whatever piece of hardware you‚Äôre using for itunes and that is always on. from your ipad, gooey accesses a web of sharing, anonymous arbitrators. get your facebook friends or google+ circle to join in! your web of friends share the computational workload required to quickly process your google search and read all the results returned by google. this is where gooey does its magic. by reading and detecting the strongest signals from the search corpus (all returned search pages and documents from google to its max of 1,000 results), gooey cliff notes everything and generates a gooey graph. then you play with the gooey graph (if you‚Äôre a real geek, you‚Äôll know the graph by its more formal name: a network diagram). last updated: mon, may 14 2012 4:50 pm edt does gooey use a semantic engine? we can‚Äôt spell semantic. but we do know math. so, no, gooey uses advanced experimental math to do its stuff. last updated: mon, may 14 2012 4:50 pm edt what about other tablets? yes, android is a no brainer. but let‚Äôs get the ipad version done first. last updated: mon, may 14 2012 4:50 pm edt is this an open source project? we are making the gui api open source and it is also a commercial app. last updated: mon, may 14 2012 4:50 pm edt ask a question 
 this ultra exclusive design features an entirely new color pallet and design aesthetic with use of the finest materials. this masterpiece epitomizes the raw essence of beauty meeting science. combining state-of-the-art technology and engineering with timeless contemporary design, the kewi bra completely redefines the brassiere. the inner cups hold the breasts and keep the breasts slightly suspended within the kewi. this floating system provides an exact custom fit to each individual breast. the cups also help minimize the appearance of 'bouncing' or 'shaking' breasts while the body is making sharp movements as in light running or jumping. the stretchy material of the inner cups allows the breasts to move within the kewi without this movement shown outside the kewi. the double band system features a spandex/leather blend finely tailored on a velcro pallet. the bands give up to 8inches/20.32cm in adjustability allowing the user the ultimate control in range. the velcro pallet allows for a high precision, one time setting of the exact size of the user. hence, set the band adjustment once and forget it. then make use of the frontal opening system in wearing and taking off the kewi bra. the bands are reversible. one may choose the flat leather exposed to complement a backless out-fit or reverse the band if desired. the front layer features a gradient of soft textures starting with luxe satin. a zip frontal closure makes no contact with the delicate breast tissue. instead, it is separated by use of the soft nylon/spandex blend of the inner cups that hug the breasts in a comfortable embrace. the finely cut felt underwire casing provides unmatched cushioning to the ribcage. left exposed is the sensual corset styled busk closure allowing for ease of frontal opening. simply hook up, then zip down. dimensions kewi device (2015 model) the newly enhanced kewi device is designed to replace the traditional bra underwire. this not only provides structure, but a high precision targeted lift. the 6061 aircraft aluminum frame is light weight and thin, so it is not felt on the body of the user. in essence, this new design creates a high tech lift system that is invisible and conforms smoothly to the female anatomy. this view shows the internal parts of the kewi. the all-new floating tech kewi device, now engineered to mimic the shape of a conventional underwire, holds up the inner cups. the inner cups comfortably hold the bottom of each breast. these inner cups have straps on either side that are held up by the floating-tech device.‚ ‚ back internal view: the kewi is able to give a fully custom fit because the inner cups which hold the breasts are made of a loose, thin, breathable and stretchy fabric that custom fits the exact dimensions of each breast. thus, one breast being larger or smaller than the other is not a problem. the inner cups hold the breasts and keep the breasts slightly suspended within the kewi. this floating system also helps minimize the appearance of 'bouncing' or 'shaking' breasts while the body is making sharp movements as in light running or jumping. the stretchy material of the inner cups allows the breasts to move within the kewi without this movement shown outside the kewi. ‚ transparent view: this view allows one to see what happens within the bra when the kewi is worn. the outer cups have been made transparent and one can see the inner cups holding the bottom of each breast. the breasts are held up so there is a slight space between the breasts and the bottom of the outer cups. in other words, the outer cups are simply used to give an equal outer shape and do not actually hold the breasts at all. the complete kewi is strapless, therefore can be worn with a wide variety of outfits and applies no pressure on the shoulders, neck or back. most importantly, the floating tech design does the heavy lifting so you don't have to.‚ live strapless. let the bra do the rest. month 1: complete full technical pack for a detailed manufacturing/assembly process. month 2: source the best materials from suppliers both domestically &amp; internationally. month 3: manufacture an initial product run. month 4: test initial small scale manufactured kewi bras, for final bugs. month 5: after inspection, mass produce large scale orders. month 6: package orders and prepare for shipment. month 7: ship orders internationally.‚ july 1st: packages arrive kewi started with a question that came from genuine discomfort. in 2009, the i discovered the issue of larger breasted women experiencing major discomfort and pain in their shoulders and back, and after interviewing women on the subject, i was asked a simple question out of frustration; ‚Äúcan you design a bra that doesn‚Äôt hurt my back?‚Äù i worked in my basement starting with basic needle, thread and scrap materials such as bed sheets and rubber bands. after revisiting the drawing board countless‚ times, a conceptual model‚ was finally developed that could not only lift all the weight, but also give a custom fit. with five years‚ of research, prototype testing, feedback analysis, interviews with women‚ and working with engineers and designers,‚ the kewi bra was created.‚ most bras loose their fit, like the elasticity gives out. is this pretty‚ durable material? the bands are highly durable. that was one of our main concerns actually, since so many women complain of bands loosing elasticity.‚ stretch of the bands is minimal. instead, it designed similar to a wristwatch that closely holds the wrist without giving out. machine wash or hand wash? hand wash only please! machine washing is disastrous for bras. how much does it flatten, does it take a couple inches off? the bra lifts and flattens only slightly. this style is not a minimizer, but we plan to design minimizers in the future. would the breasts stay fairly still while running or jumping? the user is able to bend over and hop without falling out. light running would be held by the kewi reducing excessive bouncing as long as the breasts are placed within the inner cups. what materials are used in the bra? bra- nylon/spandex/leather/felt bands-leather/velcro devices- 6061-t6 anodized aircraft aluminum (water proof) what happens if i order the wrong size? the kewi bra is designed such that it fits a cup size above and below your selected size which lowers the margin of error. there is also a wider range of adjustability in the band for up to six inches.‚ however if you still do not recieve the best fit, simply send us an email and we will send you a free return label to mail the product back. we will then send you‚ a‚ new‚ kewi bra in your specific size free of charge. how do i ensure i get the right size? with the design of the bra in terms of sizing and fit, women simply need to know the best size that has worked for them to date. for the inner cups, the stretchy sock-like material‚ allows for a range fitting system, similar to a sock in which one size can fit a certain range of foot sizes. in the same manner, if a woman buys a bra in the size she is most comfortable with, the inner cups‚ will fit that sizing range. is the bra beneficial for breastfeeding women? the bra will be beneficial for a breastfeeding woman that has experienced an increase in cup size and would like a more supportive bra, however the bra is not yet made with a function that facilitates breastfeeding specifically. this breastfeeding friendly function of the bra however, will be coming soon. would this bra have trouble passing through security in an airport? yes. the devices are made of light, but strong anodized aluminum to withstand the weight of the breasts without bending despite being small in size. as of now, it is recommended not to wear the kewi bra when at the airport. the best alternative would be to take the bra with you in a separate bag, for the bra to be worn after exiting the airport. will the core of the system being under the arms make for just another uncomfortable area? there is actually no system‚ under the arms. the devices are located on the sides of the outer cup, away from the arms. therefore, only the band runs under the arms and around the back, as you would find in a traditional strapless bra. where is kewi based? kewi is based in los angeles, california, however‚ operates internationally. 
 jpeg &amp; chaos llp is developing and producing a new app for parents who want to change the way they have their children do their chores. with our chore commissioner app, parents will be able to set a value to chores completed by their children as well as a timeframe for the chores to be completed. the kids will then be able to view the chore list on their ipad and mark once they are completed. the completed chores are then able to be verified before the amount is transferred to the kid's "account" there is an account screen where the kid can choose to transfer the money to their "savings" or to "giving" as they wish. also, there is a payout function to which the kids can request the money be provided to them. this is not a device meant to tell parents how to teach their kids responsibility, but instead, a tool to help them teach it. the commission piece is completely optional for those who do not like the idea. 
 welcome to the kickstarter campaign for wind cycle. what is wind cycle? wind cycle is a brand created for my electric vehicle conversion project. the reason it is called wind cycle is because we plan to use wind power to charge our electric motorcycle. our prototype motorcycle will use ultra capacitors instead of batteries and wind turbines to keep the charge while in motion. once we have proof the turbines increase performance and range on our bike, we would like to fit them to other electric bikes on the market. the goal is to increase the range of an electric motorcycle by 25%. why are we on kickstarter? we have to build our prototype. wind cycle needs your support and contributions to fund the first official prototype build. the electric vehicle (ev) conversion is needed to have a low-cost electric motorcycle with the specifications needed. the reason it is called an ev conversion is because the combustion engine is removed and replaced with an electric motor, converting the bike from gas to electric. it is actually cheaper for us to do an ev conversion than it is to purchase a production level electric motorcycle. wind cycle wants to accomplish in the motorcycle market what tesla motors has accomplished in the automobile market: create a better product and outsell petroleum powered counterparts (source: http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/13/autos/tesla-sales-bmw-mercedes-audi/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 ). in the first quarter of 2013, tesla motors took over luxury car sales. we want wind cycles to not only be the best electric motorcycle but also the best overall motorcycle. current status of the project: a rolling chassis has already been acquired. the suzuki dr350 frame will allow for both on-road and off-road testing. combustion engine has been removed from the chassis. still needed for the wind turbine module prototype: we need to purchase a 3d printer and software. then we will design and print multiple types and sizes of blades. we will also need to purchase turbine generators or alternators. a voltage regulator or controller will also be needed to integrate the turbines into the charging system. design a housing to affix the turbine to. we will first make it out of cardboard to avoid high cost of materials. we will then fabricate the final housing out of plastic and steel. multiple versions will be mounted and tested to see which gets better performance and which looks the best. still needed for the ev conversion: the frame needs prepared for welding mounting brackets for the electric motor, controllers, and power source. cardboard mock ups of the parts need made to ensure proper alignment and spacing. parts need ordered. specialized tools may need purchased or rented for assembly. brackets will then need measured, cut, and welded into place. once returned the bike will be assembled. final inspection and testing will be done on the electrical odometers, signals, horn, and lights. the test drive begins! this will complete the electric vehicle conversion part of the project. we are building our own electric motorcycle for two reasons: it will have the specifications needed for our wind turbine and it's cheaper than buying a brammo or zero. plus, the ev conversion means one less bike in the salvage yard. wind cycle wouldn't be a wind cycle without the next stage: designing and fabricating the aerodynamic wind turbine modules. multiple designs will be needed to test aerodynamics and aesthetics. the modules will then be mounted and tested. so long as we increase the range of our electric vehicle by 25%, proof of concept will be reached. but we won't stop there. continuing to increase range and overall performance will continue. again, the dream would be to create an electric motorcycle that doesn't need plugged in. transportation that supplies its own power. wind cycle will help make the change to ev's easy by removing any fear of running out of charge. allocating funds $3000 development of the wind turbine modules $2,500 ‚ 3d design, printing, and testing of different types of turbine blades $‚ ‚ wind generator $450 x2 / $120 x2 alternator $‚ ‚ housing development for aerodynamics and aesthetics plastic moldings and metal framing brackets heat shrink and wiring specialized tools - drill press, mig welder rental, grinding wheels, sand blaster rental, digital multi meters, crimper tool, etc. wind turbine controller/ voltage regulator - to be determined on the output of the fabricated turbine. $5000 known parts allocation motor - motenergy me-0709 similar in performance to the perm-132 and the lemco lem-200 motors. http://www.evdrives.com/product_p/mot-me0709.htm $507.00 power - ultracapacitors: maxwell technologies - bcap3000 p270 k04 http://www.mouser.com/productdetail/maxwell-technologies/bcap3000-p270-k04/?qs=sgaepimzzmudcpmzuz%252byl4vdgr228urdhgvzbudv3h0%3d $55.59 each x 54 = $3,001.86 http://www.thunderstruck-ev.com/minibms-system.html $13.25 each x27 = $357.75 http://www.thunderstruck-ev.com/minibms-head-end-board.html $34.00 x1 power controller - alltrax axe7245 motor controller 450 amp 24-72 vdc http://www.evdrives.com/product_p/con-axe7245.htm $490.00 throttle - magura twist grip throttle 0-5k ohm http://www.evdrives.com/product_p/thr-magura-assy.htm $49.00 odometer -‚ exray-u bolt speedometer http://www.evdrives.com/category_s/1848.htm $171.00 charging - quick charge on board charger sco7220 72v 20a with select-a-charge http://www.evdrives.com/product_p/cgr-sco7220.htm $465.00 $3000 to the perks/rewards the rewards!

[must have motorcyclee endorsement on drivers license] if local, i will bring the bike to you and take you and a guest to dinner to discuss the project and future ambitions. beyond our goal (our vision) $12,000 ‚Äì this will help pay for the completion of the ev conversion of this dr350 known to wind cycle as the dust devil. your contribution will also fund the additional designing and fabrication of the wind turbines that help to extend the range. this is what wind cycle plans to use to take the motorcycle world by storm. $25,000 ‚Äì helps to complete the dust devil (dr350 ev conversion) with wind turbine kit. this amount also allows us to purchase a zero xu electric motorcycle ($10,490 msrp) and fit it with wind turbines. we will then test the purchased zero to see if we increase range. $50,000 ‚Äì wind cycle get to purchase yet another electric motorcycle to test the turbines on, brammo's enertia plus ($10,995 mspr). we will also allocate funds for trade shows and accommodations. maybe we can get enough recognition and present to both brammo and zero. $100,000 ‚Äì complete professional testing of r&amp;d prototypes driving wind cycle to market we start taking orders as soon a proof of concept is achieved. we will follow the tesla motors lead. once wind cycle has enough orders, we will go to a bank to apply for loans to go into production. wind cycle would like to be an entirely new brand of motorcycle. but if we cannot compete, we plan to fit our turbines onto electric motorcycles already on the market. this way the wind turbine can be produced and then purchased as an accessory to any electric motorcycle. this will help to extend the range of all manufactured electric bikes. the best way to get people to adopt electric vehicle's is to take the fear away. the fear that you could be left stranded due to being out of charge. it's happened to us even in our gas vehicles. gas gauge broke so we ran out of gas. no more. wind cycle wants to keep you driving and alleviate the fear of not having enough charge. this will only be a possibility after proof of concept is achieved with your help. other ways you can help even if you cannot contribute financially, help us get the word out: share our facebook and twitter posts, email your family, friends, and co-workers links to our kickstarter campaign, and talk about us. ‚ thank you all ‚ wind cycle would also like to support other ideas and projects on kickstarter by using their parts. vololights , muzamoto , and bansheehorn are the main items we are looking to use to increase the visibility and safety. these innovations have a sleek look, design, and the specifications to help wind cycle offer better options than the competition. why ultra capacitors? ultra capacitors will allow us to charge faster. they are lighter weight than batteries. lighter weight helps to increase range. the future of power is in ultra capacitors. search: graphene on google or reddit. check out these examples of ultra capacitor power: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eowmf3vki6u http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpjao1xle7w http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3x_kyq3mhm

jumpshot is perfect for a variety of situations: you purchase a brand new windows computer and want to get rid of the annoying pre-packaged junk software that came with it. your anti-virus has failed to remove a virus and nothing seems to be able to get rid of it. your pc performs sluggishly in comparison to friends and co-workers with similar computers. you want some insights on the health of your computer hardware and network connectivity. you're a savvy technogeek who gets called by friends and family with pc problems and need something simple to empower grammie with. you crave an adorable usb memory stick. sounds cool, what can jumpshot do? meet officer pete, jumpshot's captain and chief.‚ next to him is grime. grime embodies all of the evil crud (e.g. spyware, adware, viruses, bloated services, etc.) that makes you dread using your pc.‚ ‚ officer pete's passion is fighting grime with his expert team of minions. each inoculation of jumpshot comes armed with officer pete and all his minions. while your pc is sedated and you're either surfing the web or relaxing away from the computer, the jumpshot minions are feverishly working behind the scenes. each minion has a different specialty and many get smarter with experience. here's who we have on the job today: the minions do their work then report back to you in a conversational manner. additionally, new minions (features) are being trained as we speak. read on for how you can help decide which future minions make the team. alright i'm in, but is it *really* easy to use? absolutely. we utilize the highly scientific "grandma test" as our barometer for success. you launch the app, we'll take care of the rest. here's an overview of the entire experience starting with the misbehaving pc in the center: show me the warez. jumpshot usb sticks our pride and joy. high quality jumpshot usb memory sticks that pop out a spring loaded connector when you squeeze their belly (hehehe that tickles). ‚ the sticks are available in three designs and two models. an 8gb usb 2.0 model and a 32gb usb 3.0 model. all of them come pre-loaded with the same fully functional version of jumpshot which takes up less than 200mb. you're free to use the remaining space any way you like. the usb sticks are compatible for use as storage on both mac and pc. the jumpshot software however runs on pc only. the jumpshot software operates exactly the same regardless of which character you choose. it's just based on your preference for which stick you want to show off to your friends. you can use any of the sticks to run jumpshot on‚ multiple‚ computers. from left to right, kobayashi, officer pete, and sir jeffrey: that's an actual picture taken of early prototypes atop of one of our desks. the manufacturing process is still evolving as we're committed to making a quality product. no limbs falling off, breaking usb connectors, missing monocles or lost top hats. here's another shot with the usb connector popped out on officer pete and a vintage filter thrown on for good measure: early access to jumpshot‚ before the usb sticks and other swag ship out in november, we'll give our backers early access to jumpshot if we meet our funding goal. those who pledge first will be at the top of the list. with early access, you'll be able to launch our windows app that can run jumpshot directly on the hard drive (without a usb), or you can create a jumpshot usb or cd using your own media. ‚ during this free usage period, we encourage you to use jumpshot on as many computers as frequently as you like. ‚ (see "how will you charge for jumpshot as a service?"). shirts we've got a blue officer pete t-shirt and a black heathered kobayashi v-neck. both are extremely soft and do well in the wash. in fact, we recommend a wash to really break them in and let the colors settle before first wear. an awesome feature we love about both shirts is that they're‚ tag-less. stickers we've got stickers designed for officer pete, kobayashi and sir jeffrey. they are low gloss, easy to peel, stick well and measure 3.5 inches across. temporary tattoos the tattoos are 1 inch wide, and 2 inches tall. they are applied via mild pressure from a wet towel over 30 seconds. through our own testing, we've found them durable for a week even through heavy exercise. if you tire of your temporary ink before then, it's easily removed with an alcohol swab. currently available in kobayashi and sir jeffrey. how will my support help? we're a scrappy self-funded startup and we've gone pretty far on our own. our dream is to leverage the momentum and cash from our backers to truly "kick start" jumpshot into a viable standalone product. the money will feed directly into usb manufacturing, advancing the jumpshot engine and driving future improvements: usb stick manufacturing: we've got some great working prototypes but in order to make the finished usb sticks a reality we must meet a minimum order. feature direction: we respect your opinion and each backer gets a voice in helping guide us to initial public release. spreading the word: we don't have millions of dollars to throw at advertising like the other guys do. we're relying on impressing you and hoping for word of mouth to spread. if you get funded, what's on the horizon? we have a ton of neat ideas on what direction to take jumpshot and need your help to prioritize them. just a sample of what's on our road map: rate my setup: how does your hardware stack up to the average? how about your network speed? would you like a suggestion on a small hardware upgrade that could go a long way? software updates: locating the proper updates can be a pain and typically require multiple reboots. we can handle this automatically during sedation (i.e. upgrading browser plugins, windows patches, etc.). network insights: what devices are on your network? is your neighbor on your wifi? want us to automatically tune your wifi router for maximum performance? social network protection: privacy policies change regularly on facebook, etc. and can be confusing. want us to manage this for you? the list goes on and once we've picked up some momentum, we'll be opening up that dialog with you. how will you charge for jumpshot as a service? good question. quite honestly, we have a few ideas we're tossing around but we want more feedback from you. ‚ jumpshot software can run from usb, cd, or straight from the web‚ without‚ any media at all. we've priced the usb stick rewards without factoring in a price for the jumpshot software service itself. our backers are getting the usb sticks at a 20% retail discount for early adopters and a 15% retail discount for all other backers. we may keep portions of jumpshot free for all, but charge for certain new features. or provide a subscription service and charge for expanded use for it organizations. once we decide on our pricing model for the service, rest assured that our kickstarter backers will receive favorable first time pricing and extended free usage before we start charging for anything. i want more technical details. you got it. jumpshot is comprised of three main components. let's begin with the windows app. single file executable. nothing to install or uninstall. the main piece of impressive technology here is our patent-pending ability to configure the pc to start jumpshot automatically on the next boot. how? we write a one-time modification to the windows bootloader to reboot into jumpshot automatically without having to mess around with the pc bios (pressing f12, esc or whatever just in time to change the boot order). next, the system will reboot. advanced users can also utilize a jumpshot usb/cd to boot the pc cold or change the bios to load it automatically. most people won‚Äôt likely use this option unless their windows environment is so bad it can't load any apps or get internet access. jumpshot runs in a custom linux environment. with the help of some talented open source developers, we automatically load the correct drivers for the person's pc, no matter how old or decrepit it is. we're constantly adding more support every week as we see more exotic systems. we then automatically attempt to connect to the internet and prompt the user for assistance if we can't find a connection or find ourselves trapped in a captive portal (like you get at hotels). once connected, we pull down the latest jumpshot engine code which consists of about a dozen different components that run in parallel and communicate with one another. this is all proprietary code that has been in development for almost two years and in testing for over one year. as the jumpshot engine loads, it automatically mounts and attaches itself to every hard drive on the pc that contains an installation of windows xp, windows vista, windows 7, or windows 8. a simulation of each users run-time environment is created and then each of our minions go to work applying their specialty. our engine interfaces with these windows instances forensically through disk. this is what we're referencing when we use the friendlier term "pc sedation". the fact that we are able to make changes to a "sleeping" system's windows installation through linux is a key differentiator that sets us apart from the other guys. this allows us to easily wipe away malicious viruses, spyware, and bloatware which may be more stubborn and hard to clean due to the fact that the windows system is actually running. ‚ the engine is powerful in its own right... but it's fueled by a brain. enter the cloud. because jumpshot‚Äôs intelligence is in the cloud, every user gets the benefit of real-time crowd driven results fueled by other users. the local engine is in constant communication with our cloud infrastructure that we've‚ built on top of amazon web services. the brain is responsible for all our knowledge processing, number crunching and other heavy lifting. we built on amazon for scalability in handling bursts of users and ability to spontaneously dedicate new hardware for behind the scenes processing. who are you guys? we're a pair of nerds who left our day jobs and founded jumpshot for a totally selfish reason. we were exhausted being pc consultants for our family and friends. don‚Äôt get us wrong, we love to help. but we knew there had to be a better way. we both graduated from tulane university with degrees in computer science and have spent the past 10+ years working in the computer security industry. more on us: david endler: linkedin , kickstarter pedram amini: linkedin , kickstarter faq what are the minimum requirements to run jumpshot? an internet connection, at least 512mb of ram and any of the following versions of windows: xp, 2003, vista, 7, or 8. please note that if your internet connection is not working in windows, it is likely due to software, and will function through jumpshot. last updated: sat, sep 1 2012 10:13 am edt does jumpshot run on macos? not yet, the jumpshot software runs on windows only. the usb drives will function as a regular storage device for macos. some day in the distant future, we may port our software to macos as well. last updated: tue, aug 21 2012 8:31 pm edt what are the differences between the 8gb usb 2.0 and 32gb usb 3.0 models? jumpshot works exactly the same regardless of which model or design flash drive you get. the only differences are the amount of free space for your personal use and the data transfer rate. usb 3.0 is significantly faster than usb 2.0. last updated: tue, aug 21 2012 8:31 pm edt are there any technical differences between the three flash drive characters? no. the jumpshot software operates exactly the same regardless of which character you choose. it s just based on your preference for which stick you want to show off to your friends. last updated: tue, aug 21 2012 8:31 pm edt do i need a jumpshot flash drive to use the jumpshot software? no. with the eventual public release of our windows app, you ll be able to run jumpshot directly from the app (without a flash drive), or you can create a bootable jumpshot usb / cd using your own media. however, until general availalability (some time next year), we re only pre-releasing the service to backers who pledge at any of the flash drive reward levels. last updated: tue, aug 21 2012 8:31 pm edt does this mean i don t need anti-virus (av) software anymore? no. jumpshot is not anti-virus, we can t *prevent* an infection. your av is running every time you boot windows. jumpshot is a solution you use periodically or as needed. last updated: thu, sep 20 2012 3:55 am edt how long will the jumpshot service be free to backers? jumpshot will be available free for unlimited use during the early access period. in fact, we encourage you to run it on as many grimy systems as you can get your hands on. the unlimited free early access period for backers will last until at least march of 2013. at which point we ll offer a discounted service rate to backers only. we ll be using the early access period to collect feedback, measure our monthly cloud costs, and determine a pricing model for the service. last updated: tue, aug 21 2012 8:31 pm edt ask a question

i am a filmmaker and entrepreneur with over 15 years of production experience. although i am not an engineer or electrician, i am qualified to bring the goplug from concept to completion. i have overseen multi-million dollar productions for fortune 500 companies as well as delivered campaigns/commercials/corporate projects on time and under budget. these projects require a specialized team of professionals with many disciplines to meet the objectives. the approach i‚Äôm taking with these products is similar to projects i have done in the past‚Äî by contracting with highly skilled professionals who specialize in design to make the goplug the best bag on the market. that is why i have partnered with the manufacturer i have chosen. they have many years of experience in textile design and bag manufacturing. byron -‚ byron holds a bachelor's of science degree in information technology, specializing in cyber security.‚ he studied and taught in the mechatronics program, growing his mechanical design and rapid prototyping skill set. he also has experience in human interface design and testing, project management, and other fun stuff. he likes to work on robotics and computing projects in his spare time, focusing on his 3d printers, security research, and mad science. 
 thanks for an amazing kickstarter campaign! the next chapter of 3d printing is just beginning. pre-order your form 1 at formlabs.com read about the form 1 on:‚ engadget ‚ wired ‚ techcrunch ‚ boingboing ‚ core77 ‚ xconomy ‚ make: ‚ the verge ‚ the boston globe ‚ fast company are you frustrated that low-end 3d printers don‚Äôt have the quality to make the true beauty of your designs real? do you dream of having the power and resolution of a truly professional machine on your desktop? we‚Äôve created an easy-to-use system that rivals the output of high-end printers at a fraction of the cost. formlabs is disrupting 3d printing. our reason for starting this project is simple: there are no low-cost 3d printers that meet the quality standards of the professional designer. as researchers at the mit media lab, we were lucky to experience the best and most expensive fabrication equipment in the world. but, we became frustrated by the fact that all the professional-quality 3d printers were ridiculously expensive (read: tens of thousands of dollars) and were so complex to use. in 2011, we decided to build a solution to this problem ourselves, and we are now ready to share it with the world. high resolution belongs on your desktop. we‚Äôve been hard at work for over a year, and with your help, we‚Äôre ready to take the form 1 into full-fledged production. by supporting this effort, you‚Äôll be the first to get your hands on an amazing 3d printer and help usher in a new era of 3d printing - an era in which your creative output is no longer limited by price or dauntingly complex machines. the form 1 will change creative design. we‚Äôve gone to extraordinary lengths to design a complete 3d printing experience: the form 1 printer is engineered to produce high resolution parts with the touch of a button form software is intuitive and simple to use so you can spend less time setting up prints and more time designing the form finish post-processing kit keeps your desktop organized so that you can easily put the finishing touches on your masterpiece read on for more details on what you‚Äôll help bring into the world (and onto your desktop) if you support this effort. hardware - the form 1: for most designers, the extruded plastic (i.e. fdm) of low-end printers is simply not capable of the high resolution and quality surface finish necessary for professional work. so, we decided to go straight for the real deal: a stereolithography printer we call the form 1. stereolithography (sl) is the gold standard for accuracy and resolution in the 3d printing world, reaching layer thicknesses and feature sizes that are worlds ahead of what is possible with fdm. the process is pretty straightforward - a laser is used to draw on the surface of a liquid plastic resin that hardens when exposed to a certain wavelength of light. the laser draws and hardens a layer at a time until the entire model is built. it‚Äôs simple, reliable, and quiet. unfortunately, sl is traditionally one of the most expensive 3d printing processes. with pricey lasers and high-precision optical components, sl 3d printers can easily cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. until now. ‚ check out these pictures of parts made with the form 1 as compared to a currently available fdm printer: after a great deal of research, engineering, and experimentation, we‚Äôve figured out how to do it at a much, much lower cost, making this premium technology available to everyone. the results are amazing: the form 1 can print layers as thin as 25 microns (0.001 in) with features as small as 300 microns (0.012 in) in a build volume of 125 x 125 x 165 mm (4.9 x 4.9 x 6.5 in). this means you can print complex geometries with the exquisite details and beautiful surface finish that will make your creations stand out. form print software:‚ great hardware is only half the battle. we painstakingly designed our form software to have a simple, intuitive user experience that streamlines the process of importing .stl models from any 3d cad package. generating smart support structures for complex geometries and sending jobs to the printer is as easy as a few clicks. a key advantage of the form software is the ability to precisely generate thin, breakable support structures that serve their purpose during printing but are easily removed afterward. test users have delightfully compared this part removal to a feeling almost like separating velcro. you can finally print those designs with crazy overhangs! materials: when the form 1 is released, it will come with our first material - a neutral matte gray that is great for look-and-feel models, standalone parts, or even as a base color for painting. after a successful launch (thanks to your support!), we will continue development of an entire palette of materials for your printer. a variety of colors, transparency, flexibility, and even burnout capability for lost wax casting processes are all possible with sl. accessories - form finish kit: with any 3d printing process, there are key finishing steps to get your print into its final and ready-to-use form. with sl, each part comes out of the printer with a small amount of liquid resin on its surface. we‚Äôve designed the form finish kit - a finishing tray and accessories set to assist you and keep your workspace clean and organized during this process. after printing, all you need to do is remove the build platform from the printer, set it into the tray, snap the model off its supports, and use the rinsing basket to clean the print for final use. check out our website for step by step photos! we are ready for full production with your support. so where are we in this whole process? we‚Äôve: formed an awesome team in boston, montreal, and london engineered the system to be mass-manufactured built and tested 7 generations of prototypes tested a wide range of material formulations written and optimized thousands of lines of code tested a production run of alpha units we‚Äôre nearly ready to set up full-scale manufacturing to get your form 1 delivered as soon as possible. we take this last crucial step seriously, and we‚Äôll need a lot of support to do the job right. that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve turned to kickstarter to get the production lines up and running! if you decide to pitch in, you‚Äôll get a discount and be one of the first to have our product on your desktop. but more importantly, you‚Äôll play a huge part in starting this revolution in 3d printing by providing your feedback and creating amazing things with the form 1. we can‚Äôt wait to see what you can design!

 electricity is the energy that powers the future, but will there be enough to power the growing needs of our global community? although there are many ways to generate electricity, for different applications, places and spaces, traditionally, it is generated at locations that are some distance from the point of usage. this requires transmission lines, which taken together comprise what is known as the electric grid. i recently became interested in developing a small, efficient and rugged source of direct current or dc electricity, for local consumption, generated by local wind energy. this sort of unobtrusive, locally acceptable, portable device is not widely available at this time. this is due in part to problems that are associated with the better known, propeller driven windmills, which are noisy and unsightly. they are generally unacceptable in urban environments. and so, the urban wind power potential is roundly ignored! little is said about harvesting the wind anywhere, and everywhere it abounds, not just on large wind farms.‚ the design i am advocating uses a vertical shaft rotor and resembles an air conditioner in shape and size. it is silent and has no exposed moving parts.‚ why has this industry been so slow to get started?‚ why is there not some ubiquitous, unobtrusive, silent and safe device on rooftops or windy ground locations? as more and more of the devices of daily life use dc, a reliable source dedicated to powering them could make a valuable contribution to the ever growing need for electric energy. constant innovation within the field of technology has brought about a new generation of highly energy efficient, mobile devices that require a significantly less amount of energy to power.‚ in underdeveloped regions of the world, with no functioning grid, pinpoint sources of electricity may be useful to connect schools and communities to the outside world, and to make possible low consumption lighting in communities.‚ what is a "windenhol," and how does it work? windenhol is a coined word, the combination of "mindenhol," the hungarian word for "everywhere," and the english word "wind." ‚ it is a reference to the fact that everywhere on the planet there are windy places where small machines such as this one can be used to harvest energy. ‚ this opportunity to produce useful energy anywhere off the grid is the meaning of windenhol. about the creator i am steven halverson, and i recently ended a 43 year career as a master furniture maker. my business had been at the same storefront location all those years and had become well known in berkeley and beyond. previously, i was a research engineer at the university of california, space sciences laboratory, providing engineering support to a variety of research projects. to take an idea to a completed artifact, to make things, is my passion. my handmade furniture is found in the best of homes but was also very affordable and practical.‚ in 2011 i became inspired to work on a small wind powered generator after seeing the suffering and devastation on a tv report of a disaster. i felt that such a device could be extremely useful, not only in the aftermath of disasters, but as a supplement to the grid in normal times. after making two functioning prototype machines, i now have a concept for a mass-producible version. i would be thrilled to build a next prototype, this time with a final production design as my goal. in the same storefront where i sold my furniture for 43 years, i would like to become an advocate for small wind powered machines and offer a working concept of one.‚ the following is a breakdown of anticipated costs for a 6 month period to complete the pre- production prototype: $ 1,100‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ fabricate base $ 3,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ fabricate main mast and large support wheels $ 20,000 ‚ ‚ ‚ computer modeling of blades and deflector cowling $ 5,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ fabricate blades $ 5,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ fabricate deflector cowling $ 5,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ fabricate gearbox $ 2,500‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ cost of generator and battery ballast $ 1,500‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ fabricate circular track and support carriages‚ $ 9,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ overhead (rent, utilities) $ 2,500‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ legal costs $ 5,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ fees $ 2,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ wind tunnel $ 2,000‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ instrumentation and measurement stretch goals: as a reminder, the direct goal of this fundraising project is the development and fabrication of an optimized,‚ professionally‚ engineered pre-production prototype. ‚ based on the feedback i have received from multiple sources, i am more than confident that i will eventually go a step further and enter the production phase. ‚ the test results of the prototype would dictate whether or not another version will be made before production. ‚ in the event of a successful fundraising drive, my efforts to ultimately enter the production phase would be greatly accelerated. ‚ any amount of money in excess of the initial fundraising goal will go towards any future steps and costs associated with this project. however, in the event that i am not able to go forward with my plans due to any‚ unforeseen difficulties, or for any reason whatsoever, i will‚ communicate with all of our backers‚ to reach an agreement on how to best move forward. ‚ this includes anything and everything that may affect any rewards, or donors, in even the slightest way. i pledge 100% transparency on every single step of the entire development and production process. ‚ i fully intend this to be a project of collaboration between donors/supporters and myself, and to that end, i not only welcome but solicit your input.‚ updates on the project will be posted on the www.windenhol.com website, and will be sent via email newsletters. 
 origin of the oddwerx species what if your iphone or android phone, or ipod touch was mobile and socially engaging? ologic has created the oddwerx platform to give you just that! ‚ the first prototypes debuted last year at google's developer conference, ‚ google i-o 2011 .‚ the initial feedback we received was, can it do more? we went back to the drawing board and made it modular so you could add wheels or tracks, and tied in lots of robotics research software. ‚ the oddwerx was born. we have some great prototypes, you may have seen on cnet, the daily planet show on discovery channel, or in the new scientist. ‚ we need kickstarter sponsors so the oddwerx can evolve into a production ready-product. the big vision autonomous consumer robotics has always been limited by computing resources. ‚ with the rise of the smartphone, it makes sense to leverage the computing power consumers already own by just turning the smartphone into a mobile robotic platform. ‚ as smartphones evolve into more powerful computing devices, robots will be able to evolve with them, since the bulk of the problem solving happens within the phone itself. ‚ robots are the ultimate phone ‚Äúappcessory‚Äù.‚ there are more details about the overall vision on the oddwerx blog:‚ http://www.oddwerx.com/category/vision/ ‚ why kickstarter? to make a highly articulated robotic platform that can support carrying a wide array of smartphones and keep the unit costs down, the design screams for injection molded plastics. we are on kickstarter to raise funds for the tooling and to build an initial run of robots! what do you get? with your $99 pledge you get a basic kit to put together the oddwerx robot with tracks.‚ you can get the extra parts to do the wheeled robot too for the $115 pledge, and then you can decide which you like best. ‚ why a kit you ask?‚ putting the robot together yourself is super easy, makes the robot more affordable and familiarizes you with the process of interchanging its parts.‚ if you really want one pre-assembled, we have a higher pledge amount to cover the costs of doing it for you. here is a list of what will come in the box: plastic parts for the body, the track holders, sprockets and bogy ‚ wheels, and a pair of rubber tracks a circuit board ready to install into the body screws and pins to hold everything together two servos used for the robot to be able to get up and down two metal gear motors for the drive train + wiring harness one suction cup to hold the phone to the robot (this allows you to mount the phone to the robot in many different orientations) sticky velcro dot to use instead of a suction cup, in case your phone has a funny, non-suctioncuppable back removable 3xaaa battery holder (you can use either alkaline or rechargeable cells. ‚ since you can remove it, you could put your own lipo cell in there instead) why oddwerx? as you have probably noticed, there are a couple of ‚Äúother‚Äù smartphone robots out there. ‚ unlike the others, oddwerx is designed completely from the ground up to be an expandable platform for developing autonomous robotics applications, that can socially‚ engage, and be interactive. if you want an app that is simply an r/c vehicle with video, you can do this in a snap with oddwerx, however you can do much-much more than that! oddwerx platform features: modular - tracks and wheels with‚ interchangeable‚ parts multi-platform - works with both iphone and android phones small size ‚ - small enough to fit in a big pocket‚ no wires required - uses bluetooth wireless to talk to the robot. bi-directional data communication - since we use bluetooth, we can read sensors on the robot and issue commands too extendable - lots of sensors and accessories coming soon hackable - you can make your own sensors, or plastic accessories developer library - (more info below) support for open source and advanced r&amp;d robotics oddwerx smartphone app: there is one main oddwerx app that the robot works with right out of the box. ‚ ‚ this sample app is designed as a demonstration of some of the capabilities of the oddwerx robot and shows how powerful the platform can be with a good app! social robots are great. you can get some super ideas for what makes a good one work from the personal robotics group at the mit media lab. there are two pre-loaded personalities to choose from: ike - a wild guy with a thirst for adventure, and romance lucy - a sweet girl with sassy attitude the apps use an advanced computer vision library combined with the onboard camera in the smartphone to maximize their interface with the world.‚ they are designed to seek out human interaction through the use of face detection and face tracking combined with mobility. support for serious future expansion: the oddwerx are built for expandability.‚ what good is a robot that cannot be adapted to solving lots of highly specialized problems? functional accessories :‚ the electronics are expandable to add a variety of different sensor options: line sensors for line following and edge detection ‚ ( this sensor is the only sensor currently available depending on your kickstarter pledge level) obstacle sensors for wall following and obstacle avoidance wheel encoders for distance measurement and wheel odometry bump sensors ‚ for interacting with the world in a tactile manner infrared receiver/transmitters for interacting remotes and other robots small gripper for mainpulating and moving small objects and interacting with the robots environment fashion accessories &amp; gear : ‚ there are slots in the top of the oddwerx base that allow you to add fashion accessories and gear, such as hats, ears, headphones, spears, clubs, as well as sensory hardware, making it easy to develop socially engaging robots that provoke‚ human-robot interaction . we are not offering any accessories yet on kickstarter, but we have some cool prototypes for them and hope to offer them soon. if lucy and ike had kids they might look like this.... developer api &amp; sample apps: the oddwerx has a developer api, along with sample applications for both iphone and android.‚ the sample application is called oddwerx dude and has a silly face with eyes, to give the sample some personality.‚ the developer api makes it easy to control and use the oddwerx base.‚ what is the next killer app that will make the oddwerx do something new and cool?‚ you can create it! ‚ are you app developer of an existing, interactive pet app? ‚ simply add a few lines of code, and the app can now be mobile! support for advanced research robotics: the oddwerx are designed to be a fusion of advanced research robotics, and a consumer electronic entertainment platform. ‚ some of the projects oddwerx supports are: ros - the robot operating system ‚ -‚ more details cloud robotics ‚ - ologic just won the silicon valley region of the cloud robotics hackathon, and placed 2nd in the world, using an oddwerx robot - ‚ more details open source cellbots projec t - ‚ more details how do i know you ologic guys can do this?‚ ologic started out as a robotics r&amp;d company, focused on consumer electronics and toy products. along the way, we designed some very cool products for others, but never for ourselves.‚ we have designed android robots for google, toys for hasbro, and we invented the star wars force trainer toy which is sold by uncle milton. ‚ we know how to design products and bring them to market and have always wanted to produce a robot product suitable for both high-end robotics r&amp;d, as well as for the consumer for fun and education. ‚ we think oddwerx is that robot . ‚ support our kickstarter by making your pledge today! frequently asked questions: does oddwerx support iphone &amp; android only? ‚ for now‚Ä¶yes.‚ no blackberry, or windows phone support at this moment.‚ maybe later on. can i use an ipod touch instead of an iphone? ‚ yes, as long as it is one of the later generations with built-in bluetooth. can the oddwerx carry a tablet? ‚ maybe a very small one, however, the current design is optimized for phone sized devices. can the oddwerx charge the phone? ‚ ‚ no. ‚ there are no physical wires connecting the phone to the robot. ‚ this allows for one dock to support many different kinds of phones. how can i support oddwerx outside of kickstarter? ‚ friend the oddwerx on facebook, add them to your circles on google+ or tweet about them on twitter with the hashtag #oddwerx where can i get more details? ‚ ‚ check out the oddwerx blog at:‚ http://www.oddwerx.com faq how complicated is the kit version? do i have to solder anything? are there any missing components i should plan on? our plan is to make the kits as easy to put together as possible. no soldering should be required. the pcb will come completely assembled, and all you will have to do is snap together the plastic parts, screw some screws, push some pins into the right spots, plug some plugs into the right connectors, put batteries in it, and you are ready. hopefully it should take less than 20 minutes to do. we will make one or more youtube videos you can watch, to step everyone through the process, pairing to your phone and firing it up. last updated: tue, apr 3 2012 12:05 am edt ask a question 
 never remembering usernames and passwords again! never typing usernames and passwords again! just 1 click on your cosmokey and the internet is yours, safely! this is our vision. if you want it, too, pledge now! our vision in more words the internet: so many possibilities ‚Äì and so many passwords! for many of us, the internet has long been an integral part of our everyday lives. many things would no longer be conceivable without the services available in the digital cosmos: emails, facebook, skype, online banking, online shopping... and then there are the other services that we only use occasionally ‚Äì ordering photos, the annual login to the insurance company's website, booking a flight for the summer holidays... how is anyone supposed to remember this increasing amount of access credentials? the solution cosmokey password management keeps all your usernames and passwords safe in one place. simply open the access-protected website, and you have all the right login information at your fingertips via app or web service. forgotten, re-used or trivial passwords are no longer a problem! and the best? you choose, what to do with it. do you want to entrust us with your encrypted credentials or do you want to host the password manager yourself? the only thing you need from us is the cosmokey, the rest is up to you. we will provide you with the necessary software, so you can integrate your cosmokey 2-factor-authentication for whatever you decide. for further details please see our stretch goals below. why 2-factor? you will probably agree that a username and password do not provide the security you need for your web applications. 2-factor authentication can be really annoying. but not any longer. with cosmokey, 2-factor authentication has become user-friendly ‚Äì just one click and the second factor is generated. ‚ how does it work? 1 click on your cosmokey app or token you login into your web account and thus initiate the verification process if both factors are validated positive, you can access your web application. but is it really secure? more security is the fundamental idea behind cosmokey: this easy-to-use password manager is safeguarded via a second channel, but at the same time it's so user-friendly that only a single touch of a button is required. on one's own mobile phone by means of an app, or ‚Äì for increased security ‚Äì using the personalized cosmokey token. you will actually use 2-factor-authentication, because it will provide more convenience to you. why an app? a smartphone app is very convenient. you carry the device with you most of the time, anyways. but be aware: a smartphone is unsecure by design. the choice is yours. why hardware? a smartphone is by definition not a secure device. it's possible for an attacker to get an unhealthy amount of control over your device. our hardware cosmokey on the other hand is a pretty challenge for attacks. 1-click convenience: all you need to do to generate your second factor is to press 1 single button. stand-alone device: no interface to your pc or mac is required - it works with every hardware: tower, tablet, smartphone, from every place: at home, at work, from your friend‚Äôs place, without anything to adjust or install. international use: you are travelling? by using the international standards like gsm, your cosmokey goes where you go. long battery life: the hardware token has power beyond our expectations, the app is energy-conserving. palm stone design: enjoy the secure feeling cosmokey provides does the cosmokey hardware token work already? we have just successfully fulfilled all official requirements for achieving the ce sign for our cosmokey hardware, audited by an independent jury. currently we are conducting an alpha test, securing vpn tunnels and thus making the remote login safer. right now: cosmokey vpn mobile and flexible ‚Äì these are keywords for modern companies, their employees and also for cosmokey vpn. as a role concept solution it makes external access to the corporate network via vpn not only more secure but also easier. and because it is not dependent on any particular interface, it really does work on all devices, whether laptops, tower pcs, macs, smartphones or tablets. we have just successfully finished the development of cosmokey vpn and now we start to sell the product to interested companies. the future: cosmokey vault cosmokey vault will make everyday online life so much easier. we have a prototype working, have a look: checking emails, online banking, booking a flight for the summer holidays, visiting social networks ‚Äì every time we need to enter the right username and password. it‚Äôs good to know that the cosmokey password manager keeps this information for all our applications safely in one place. it always provides the correct log-in data via app or web service without the user having to re-enter any password or username. and you will never fear keyloggers again. why should you as a users decide? with the planned features ‚ you can use this convenient 2-factor-authentication for anything you like. you have control over the application.‚ the same goes for our final vision, the 2-factor secured password administration. if you don't want us to store and secure your data, we provide you with all means to host it yourself.‚ we believe in freedom of choice for the user, you decide what you want to do with it. stretch goals at the following amounts, we can make your life easier by offering these different features: any developer can use this api for free. so they can easily set up a complete two-factor authentication system out of the box without a fee cloud password manager with one-click technology. runs on your server or on ours . use secure passwords easily schedule right now we are testing the first hardware prototypes and aim to to mass produce them. we already developed a way to use our system as additional protection for a vpn login. the certification process for europe is done, so we are confident that we will keep up with the following time table: reserve your own personal cosmokey and back this project right now. the history the main‚ reason the founders of money and data protection developed the cosmokey was to address something that had been troubling them personally. surely there had to be a way to deal with the ever-increasing flood of user ids and passwords. the brilliantly simple idea thought up by money and data protection was to double protect a password management system with an additional device ‚Äì a mobile phone or a hardware token ‚Äì at the touch of a button. and that‚Äôs how cosmokey was born. but how should we start this project? first of all, there had to be a lot of investment to develop the concept of cosmokey. business case, design of the product, material,‚Ä¶ the idea of cosmokey was built up piece by piece. with the persuasive power of the idea cosmokey was developed to the current moment. now, we have successfully fulfilled all official requirements for achieving the ce sign for our cosmokey hardware, audited by an independent jury. team ‚Äúi live my life online and i‚Äôm excited about the infinite opportunities and perspectives that technology can offer for the future. in the past there was no really convincing solution for passwords available, so self-help was called for. and out of one great idea grows a whole company.‚Äù ‚Äúwhat impresses me most about cosmokey is the convenience and accessibility it provides ‚Äì it‚Äôs so easy to use and is barrier-free accessible. so the cosmokey token can even be used by people with impaired vision.‚Äù ‚ ‚Äúi work as financial manager for this project, because i want to make the world a little bit safer with the brilliantly simple idea behind cosmokey.‚Äù 
 the arc angel is much more than a basic basketball shooting device... it is shooting 'perfection' . the units are mobile and cover various shooting distances and shooting angles for (5) shooters at one time.‚ 1. the goal posts raise and lower and are what the shooter shoots over and through. ‚ 2. the goal posts have clustered red vertical laser firing lights that go straight up and work with the shooters wrist and basketball sensors. this vertical firing light also moves left and right with the shooters movements. the clustered red horizontal laser firing lights also work with the shooters wrist and basketball sensors. the vertical and horizontal firing lights therefore create a ‚Äút‚Äù that the shooter aims for and shoots over. 3. there are multiple sensors affixed to the goal posts to pick up the exact flight of the basketball. 4. the led small lights can be adjusted in intensity depending upon the shooters preference. 5. the shooting distance display screen allows the shooter to actually see the distance (feet) they are shooting from on the basketball floor. ‚ 6. the small sensors pick up the flight of the basketball. 7. there are countdown clocks countdown clocks above each firing tube. these countdown clocks count down the seconds so that the basketball shooter is alerted when each of the basketballs will be shot out of the firing tubes. 8. the locked in display screen alerts the shooter that the shooting is about to begin. 9. the batteries are what power and moves the mobile units around the basketball court. 10. the programmed computer system allows the all of the system to work in unison. 11. the shooter evaluation station is a (24‚Äù) touch screen tablet computer affixed to the left side of each of the arc angel devices. it is where each individual shooter evaluates his or her shooting form, and visually sees his or her mistakes in their shooting form. powerful software will allow the shooter to see every aspect of their form from the multiple camera angles inside the arc angel itself. slow-motion camera angles will also be available to the shooter. 12. the round wheels allow the mobile units to move freely about the basketball court. ‚ 13. the brakes allow all of the arc angel units to stop in place. 14. the hydraulics raise and lower the arc angel units firing tubes ‚Äòcatch point‚Äô for each shooter. each shooter varies in height. the ‚Äòcatch point in the hands‚Äô for a 5‚Äô2‚Äù shooter is different than the ‚Äòcatch point in the hands‚Äô for a 6‚Äô8‚Äù shooter. the goal is to get the basketball into the shooters hands each time. 15. the camera‚Äôs are affixed to the front and side of the arc angel units to take pictures of the shooter so they can self-evaluate their shooting form through the shooter evaluation station. 16. there are (3) forward firing tubes where the basketball explodes outward to the shooter. the arc angel machine will also rotate the (3) firing tubes giving the shooter various ‚Äòcatch angles‚Äô to fire the basketball from, since the basketball is never delivered from the same spot all the time on the basketball court. 17. the basketball traveling firing tubes are inside the arc angel units and allow the basketballs to travel to be exploded outward to the shooter.‚ 18. these laser lights will hit the shooters chest sensor, therefore locking the shooter in before they actually begin shooting. 19. the spider is in the back of the (5) arc angel units. it is here where the basketballs are collected and delivered to the mobile units. 20. the spiders web is the netting affixed on long poles that deliver the basketballs to the spider unit.‚ 21. the sensor poles gather information from the basketball sensors that is delivered to the computer main system for dissemination. there are (1214) total nba teams, wnba teams, teams in division i college basketball, division ii college basketball, division iii college basketball and teams in the naia. the collective number of high schools nationally totals (37,100). public high schools total (26,407) and private high schools total (10,693).‚ ‚ any nation, professional basketball team, college/university basketball team or high school basketball team that ‚Äòdoes not‚Äô have an arc angel unit will be at a ‚Äò competitive disadvantage‚Äô to the ones that do. a prediction: as the arc angel units are utilized by nations around the globe‚Ä¶ america will lose its competitive advantage in regards to the basketball part of the olympic games. the arc angel units teach shooting perfection, so ‚Äòmultiple hot shooters‚Äô hitting from the outside in a single game can defeat any post up, dribble drive or athletically superior team. the olympic games therefore will become a ‚Äòpick em‚Äô event with all nations able to effectively compete.‚ the obesity factor: the obesity problem across the united states and specifically in high schools has hit a tipping point. introducing the arc angel units into high schools is a ‚Äòtop

 why digihoop? we believe that your hoop should express who you are, be easy to use, last for an entire evening of hooping, and most of all, be rugged enough to stand the test of time. all too often we run across hoopers that have stacks of hoops in their closets because each one only has one pattern, or very few modes. our vision is simple: make one hoop that is upgradable and reusable that can replace all the others. how? we have taken the latest technology and crammed it into a standard sized hoop. each hoop has a microprocessor that can individually control each of the 100 rgb leds. we wanted digihoop to have a continuous ring of light and not show a battery black spot like other led hoops. we solved this issue by designing custom sized lithium polymer batteries (like the one in your smartphone) and placing them inside the inner ring of the hoop, behind the leds. we use four 1.2ah batteries giving us a total capacity of 4.8ah, with the ability to add more if we need to. this gives us an astounding runtime of up to 6 or more hours depending on the active pattern. charging the hoop is just a matter of plugging in a standard usb charger or cable. digihoop doesn't have external switches or buttons. we felt that they just got in the way and would break easily. so instead we use internal magnetic switches. to turn digihoop on you simply slide the hoop inward from its charging position to the run position and it turns on. to change the pattern you are running, wave the included magnet over the digipoi logo and the hoop will advance to the next pattern in the playlist. what is digihoop? digihoop is a smart 100 rgb led hoop that is microprocessor controlled and weighs a mere 18 ounces. digihoop is both hardware and firmware upgradable. this means that when we come out with new features like bluetooth smartphone integration, all you will need to do is send the hoop back to us for the hardware upgrade. firmware will be hooper upgradable, and eventually you will be able to design your own custom patterns then download them along with your playlist to your hoop. there will be a social pattern website ( http://my.digipoi.com ) where hoopers like you can design, exchange, and download custom patterns. the future. we have plans in the works to take the same technology in the digihoop and re-invent other led props such as, staves, spinning poi, jugging balls, jugging clubs, and floating wands--and make them all compatible with each other. imagine having any combination of led props and they are all sequenced to a light or music show. need all the props to turn red, green then blue at once? it can happen. we need your help to make this dream a reality, and we have chosen the digihoop to start with. how can you help? we have spent the last 2 years of our own money and hard work to bring digihoop where it is today. we need your kickstarter pledge to help take it the rest of the way and fund our first production run of the digihoop. all of the digihoop production is done at our facility in dallas, texas. none of it is shipped out or sent overseas. so pledge any amount you can, every dollar does make a difference, and be sure to tell your fellow hoopers about us. and one last thing, if we don't reach our pledge goal by oct 15th we won't get any of the pledges. kickstarter is all or nothing. faq how does one go about designing a custom pattern set? initially, you will choose the patterns you would like in your hoop from a preset list. after a firmware upgrade, you will be able to use software on your computer, and eventually our website to design patterns and playlists. last updated: wed, sep 14 2011 2:05 pm edt how much will the hoops cost when the come out for sale? the hoops are expected to retail for $300 each last updated: wed, sep 14 2011 2:05 pm edt will there be a waiting list when they come out? the possibility of a waiting list depends on demand. last updated: wed, sep 14 2011 2:05 pm edt when will they be for sale? if the kickstarter is successful then shortly thereafter, if not it could be next spring or as late as summer. last updated: wed, sep 14 2011 2:05 pm edt how can i buy one of these awesome hoops? if you pledge at the $250 [the hooper] level you will be one of the first to own a digihoop. last updated: sun, aug 21 2011 11:10 pm edt ask a question

follow us on twitter!!! ever dreamed of the day when your shirts, shoes, and even furniture will magically clean themselves? well, no need to dream any more because liquidoff is there as your knight in shining armor (literally). we have developed a solution that uses the power of nanotechnology to repel against those countless wine spills, mud splatters, baby puke, and whatever else life brings your way. and all this take is a simple spray onto the surface of anything you wish to protect. liquidoff technology offers a safe and effective self-cleaning solution through the use of nanotechnology. compared to traditional applications, liquidoff is completely safe and produces much better results in regards to it's super hydrophobic properties and washing permanence. our spray also has no effect on clothing comfort, look, feel, or breathability. we are the 100% green and eco-friendly solution that contains no harmful chemicals and is completely aerosol-free! yes, that's right! no nasty harmful chemicals or toxic aerosol cans that could lead to detrimental health effects or even cancer like some of the other guys. we are the green and eco-friendly solution that will not only save you time and money, but also promote a cleaner and healthier lifestyle. composed of our proprietary trade-secret formulation, liquidoff is a strong super hydrophobic coating that protects against water, dirt, contamination and stains. liquidoff is not only revolutionary due to its safe, water-based formula; it is also unique as it can be used on an endless array of fabrics and textiles. a simple spray of our solution onto any clothing, shoes, or car seat will create a protective barrier that magically repels against all things liquid; whether its water or wine, ketchup or barbecue sauce. waterproofing has never been this easy. this is thanks to our proprietary nanotechnology formula. liquidoff will forever change your life. now cleaning and washing is a breeze since treated materials are easily cleaned and require less frequent washing. liquidoff began in response to complaints from consumers about the effectiveness and hazardous contents of existing products on the market. we listened to what people had to say, and an idea was formed on how this market need could be met. this idea was fostered by our high-level scientific research team and the idea started to take shape. nanotechnology came out of the research lab and into the manufacturing stage. today, liquidoff is just one of many unique and effective products that we will be bringing to market as a direct result of our cutting edge developments in nanotechnology. with the help of experienced senior technical members and a proven scientific testing system, our team continues to come up with solutions for customer needs. because it's awesome!. almost all liquid will easily roll off of any treated textile or fabric.many products claim to be super hydrophobic, but they just don‚Äôt match up. we‚Äôve obliterated the competition by providing a contact angle with water that is above 150 degrees. liquidoff does not include harmful compounds or chemicals.unfortunately, we can‚Äôt say the same for other repellant solutions, which are toxic and loaded with harmful chemicals that are both harmful to human health and the environment. many even contain carcinogens which are widely known to cause cancer. for treated materials that does not require washing (shoes, furniture, automotive interior, etc), liquidoff will last for 2-5 years. for treated materials that requires washing (clothing, tablecloth, etc.), liquidoff will last for up to 20 washes under optimal conditions. liquidoff will never damage your clothing, so if repelling properties start to fade, simply apply another coating to the area. you may apply as many times as you wish. clothing is machine or hand washable‚ do not bleach do not use detergent the self-cleaning properties of liquidoff causes it to be easily cleaned and require less frequent washing. for longer lasting results, we recommend not to use detergent or bleach when washing. almost all treated materials can be washed with water alone. therefore, chemical infused cleaners that are damaging to the environment are no longer required. please note that the longevity of the repelling properties depend on a various amount of factors such as the strength of the detergent used (if any at all), the amount of abrasion a treated material undergoes, as well as the amount of coating applied. therefore, longevity will be dependent upon the individual. liquidoff protects against the transmission of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. your treated materials will be completely microorganism-free. when we say ‚Äúsimple,‚Äù we are not kidding. here is our application process: spray allow to dry be amazed! other products require complex and tedious application processes and require you to wear a plethora of safety gears such as gloves and ventilation masks, etc. with liquidoff, you never have to worry about toxic chemical fumes or drastic safety measures thanks to our easy, clean, and eco-friendly solution. though we recommend at least 12-24 hours of dry time to achieve the complete effect, simply using a blow dryer, heat gun, or iron will drastically reduce the wait time to only a few minutes. (of course if you are a most leisurely type of person, just wait the few hours for the treated material to completely dry.) there is yet another benefit to our product- it hides any visible evidence of sweat on your clothes. say goodbye to sweaty underarms forever! liquidoff is invisible, as the treatment dries clear onto all surfaces.other products leave a white hazy cloud, but not liquidoff. liquidoff will not affect the breathability level or texture of your clothing or materials once they‚Äôve been treated.your garments will not be damaged, hardened or become uncomfortable in any way. want to make something more resistant to scuffing, scratching and wearing down? liquidoff it adds a layer of abrasion resistance to whatever fabric it is applied.this also helps to extend the life of the treatment. use liquidoff on virtually any fabric or textile.whether it‚Äôs your favorite clothing, your tablecloth, your car seat or your new shoes, liquidoff does it all.so feel free to put your imagination to work. liquidoff is the perfect answer to a stain-free day. thank you for viewing our campaign and we hope that you will back us - the green and eco-friendly solution that will save you time and money while allowing you to lead a cleaner and healthier lifestyle. check out our rewards for some awesome stuff ... including this shirt that has been deep treated with our liquidoff solution: 
 the motivation mathematics is not like history or philosophy. with those subjects, it's possible to become knowledgeable about them simply by sitting down and talking about them. mathematics is more like music, or a foreign language - it is a mental ability that requires practise through repetition and variation. so no matter how many times someone explains ‚ to you how to differentiate a trigonometric function, or how to convert radians into degrees, you'll never really know ‚ how to do it until you've had a go at it a number of times yourself. moreover, when first learning about a topic in mathematics, most students will work through the questions they find in their textbooks. this means that when it comes to revision a while later, they don't have any new questions to do. this mathematics revision application aims to resolve both of these problems, and, in doing so, improve the efficiency of revision. so many students waste time during revision by reading explanations - this application allows them to actually‚ practise . the web-application gives students randomly created questions - to which the computer figures out the answer. the questions are not pulled from a large data-bank of hundreds of pre-written questions - they are randomised (so they are infinite in number) and the student has ‚ to work out the answer (they can't look it up). the aim at the moment a scaled-down version of the application exists at http://www.mathematicsrevision.com/‚ - currently it can only give maths students a handful of different questions. this money, if raised, will go towards upgrading the application, so that it can give students a comprehensive set of different questions relevant to the uk a-level syllabuses. some money will also go towards publicising the application to raise awareness of it. the application will be usable throughout its development, and what's more it'll be free and unlimited for all students.

 sinurelief is the brainchild of scott archbold, who set out to develop a versatile device to relieve his chronic sinus problems. "as a sinus sufferer i know firsthand that a single sinus relief device does not help everyone equally. in my search for sinus relief i have used many sinus products as well as many different prescription medication sprays, with none being of great effect. with this dilemma in mind, i followed my most motivational saying, "a good engineer creates his own tools but, a great engineer uses tools that already exist", so i decided to do both. the result of this is sinurelief, the first tool that combines proven to work therapeutic treatments into a single easy to use device." what makes sinurelief different? ‚ ‚ about 37 million americans suffer from at least one episode of sinusitis a year. the feeling of pain and pressure in your face leaves many feeling tired, similar to having a cold, and unable to think straight. if you are a sinus sufferer you most likely are combining multiple forms of therapy to relieve your sinus symptoms. that is all well and good if you like filling your medicine cabinets with dozens of products, each of which does little to solve your problem. so, what makes sinurelief different? unlike other sinus products, sinurelief is a device designed to combine multiple therapies into one easy to use and comfortable solution. an example of our ground breaking approach to combat sinusitis is the combination of a gentile massage coupled with a limited amount of saline to bring about relief. this works by using the saline to change the viscosity of the mucus while opening up the sinuses allowing the sonic vibration to facilitate movement of mucus through the sinus tubes bringing relief to the user. limiting the amount of saline white paper: ‚ http://www.m.webmd.com/allergies/guide/neti-pot-nasal-irrigation-pros-and-cons?page=3 our design. in designing sinurelief, our main goals are to creating a one-of-a-kind product that is able to combine the most popular therapies out there into a single easy to use device while also being so comfortable to use that people will want to use it.‚ early development ‚ now ‚ big plans for the future! take a look. you'll need an html5 capable browser to see this content. play replay with sound play with sound 00:00 00:00 ‚ our team ‚ scott archbold - engineering student and inventor of sinurelief. ‚ ‚ dr. john castillo -‚ founder and director, head of medical advisory board, chief medical officer, director of product research and clinical trial oversight; dr. john operates one of the most successful dental clinics in southern california and is a well recognized healthcare strategist and forward thinker on the use and application of emerging technologies in healthcare. archie (dad) - has‚ 30+ years of‚ experience‚ in overseeing the marketing and sale of‚ life enhancing medical products and services to high value professional medical corporations, hospitals, clinics, and physicians. recognized for his practiced skills in channel development and medical market/product development. ‚ 
 the idea over a year ago, we started thinking about how we could build a better compression wrap for treating common sports injuries. ‚ you know the kind... sprained ankles, twisted knees, pulled hamstrings, etc. ‚ we went to china and met with factories that specialized in cut-and-sew. our initial samples fit well but didn't stand out from the crowd. ‚ basically, the first samples looked like everything else on the market. ‚ they were definitely missing something! around the same time as our china trip, we came across an industry report on the global market for hot and cold therapy products. ‚ we started thinking about how we could integrate ice packs into the compression wraps; initially targeting 5 key products. with some help from a u.s. manufacturer, we were able to get a small number of cold therapy wraps made. ‚ we shared them with elite level athletes competing in many sports - and got some really great feedback. ‚ some of the best feedback came from mixed martial arts (mma) athletes. ‚ here's john makdessi, ufc fighter testing some of our early versions of the cold therapy wraps: cold therapy‚ wraps with built-in icing and compression. a lot of athletes are familiar with the term r.i.c.e. which stands for rest, ice, compression and elevation. ‚ what makes our product better is that our wraps combine both "compression" and "icing". ‚ fullfx cold therapy wraps are ready-to-wear when frozen.‚ simply put the wrap in a freezer. its ready to use once the inside gel packs are frozen. ‚ once applied, the gels inside the neoprene will gradually thaw within 15-20 minutes - the length of time recommended by many sports‚ doctors and athletic therapists to reduce swelling. constructed of non-toxic and non-hazardous fda approved materials, fullfx cold therapy wraps are safe to use against the skin. 5 different cold therapy wraps fullfx knee wraps provide quick and efficient relief for active and reoccurring injuries, including: knee surgery‚ active sprains or strains sore/swollen knees from past injury or surgery‚ torn acl‚ dislocated or twisted kneecap torn meniscus jumper‚Äôs knee runner‚Äôs knee fullfx 3-in-1 cold therapy‚ wraps provide icing and compression to treat a variety of injuries in three common areas: elbow : overexertion, sprains, and repetitive tendon injuries such as tennis elbow, golf elbow, and nursemaid's elbow foot : heel spurs or plantar fascitis hand/wrist : wrist sprains and strains,carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, and surgical operations‚ fullfx shoulder wraps provide complete shoulder icing and compression to the front of the rib cage, over the upper chest, across the shoulder, down the upper back, and around the upper bicep for the effective treatment of: torn rotator cuff shoulder tendonitis bursitis tendon injuries shoulder impingements over-used biceps and upper arms‚ fullfx universal cold wraps provide quick and efficient relief of pain and inflammation in hard to reach areas of the body, including: pulled or tight hamstring shin splints over-worked or over-used bicep thigh strain sinus pressure headaches and migraines‚ designed to fit like an open toed, open heeled sock, the fullfx ankle / foot cold wrap provides icing and compression to treat: twisted, strain or sprained ankle ankle tendonitis torn ankle ligaments post-surgery recovery‚ going to production by supporting our campaign, you will fund our first large-scale production run. ‚ 100% of the the money we receive will go towards manufacturing. ‚ we've continued our relationship with the u.s. factory who helped us during our beta testing. ‚ they will manufacture our production run in their factory located in portland, oregon. ‚ production is expected to take 30-45 days with approximately 7-10 additional days for shipping &amp; handling. this factory will cut neoprene to our specifications, sew the the cold cell gel packs onto the inside of the wrap, and stitch the velcro on the outside. ‚ all product will be shipped in bulk to our warehouse in cambridge, ontario. ‚ we will assemble the individual packages and ship orders from canada. like most factories, our supplier has a minimum volume requirement that we need to reach before we can start production.‚ by clicking on "back this project" you can help us reach our minimum volume commitment. us and international backers our project is set up‚ to bill‚ canadian dollars ($cad). please don‚Äôt let this discourage you from backing our project. currently, the canadian dollar is lower than the $usd making our rewards slightly cheaper if you are paying in us funds and much cheaper if you are paying in ‚£gbp or ‚Ç¨eur.

 ‚ new stretch goal! light is important - it defines a space, creates atmosphere, &amp; effects how we feel. ‚ for something so important,‚ shouldn't‚ it do more than just turn on and off? we're creating a series of intelligent and tunable led lights that are bright, simple, and open a world of amazing lighting experiences. ‚ you're going to like the way your light looks, we guarantee it. you know that feeling of getting into bed and then realizing you left the light on in the hallway? or flipping through a bank of light switches and dimmers to try and create the perfect mood? or stubbing your toe as you get out of bed to go to the bathroom? yea, we hate that too so we're making ilumi to create better lighting experiences. ilumi works like a regular light bulb in the sense that it just screws into a normal socket. the kicker is that through the ilumi app, you can conveniently control your lights remotely, tune the color &amp; brightness, or even program your lights to create lighting magic. the key for ilumi is that it's bright, simple, and is all about experience. we need your support to finish up development and manufacturing, &amp; in turn we want you to be some of the first to enjoy it! what are you going to do in your living room over the next 20 years?‚ visualize all the festive holidays, birthday parties, or sporting events?‚ picture that morning cup of coffee on the couch, curling up with a movie at night, or having friends over for a party.‚ what type of lighting did you picture in each of those scenarios? the truth is that different scenarios require different types of lighting.‚ with ilumi, you have complete flexibility to adjust your lighting to any variation of both bright white lights as well as rich colors, at any brightness, any time.‚ ‚ plus, our patent-pending hyperlux led technology makes ilumi the brightest and most efficient multicolor light bulbs in its class. essentially, we pack more brightness per watt than any other multicolor light.‚ that‚Äôs important, because it‚Äôs nice to have flexibility, but we also wanted to ensure ilumi would give you the functionality for everyday as well. we love lighting control systems but hate that they are expensive and complicated.‚ with ilumi, you get the convenience of a scalable and customizable lighting control system with the ease of just screwing in a light bulb.‚ the great part is that it‚Äôs super simple. ‚ so turn off all your lights before you go to bed, set your bedroom lights to a romantic scene, or just set that one ilumi in the hall on. ‚ completely personalize and control your lighting just the way you want it.‚ also, everything is built inside the bulb, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about connecting to wifi routers or other complications and headaches.‚ ilumi uses‚ bluetooth 4.0 technology, which is now in nearly every ios and android device. ‚ with ilumi, we're also building bluetooth 4.0 meshing, so ‚ each ilumi can communicate with each other. ‚ each ilumi has a 100 foot plus range, and multiple ilumi can communicate with one another through the wireless mesh to pass on commands and extend the signal range. you can also share access with family and friends who download the ilumi app on their own devices. again, no boxes, routers, master-slave configurations or dependencies -- just screw ilumi in and it just works that simply. plus if you don't have your phone handy, you can always use an old fashioned light switch to turn your ilumi off and on to a personalized default setting. check out how easy it is to set-up your ilumi: it's all about experience with ilumi.‚ from the aesthetics of the bulb, to the ux of the app, to the amazing things you can do with your ilumi. here's an idea of what's possible: check out the ilumi music sync experience! right now we are building out two sizes of ilumi that with your help we'll introduce to the world.‚ both sizes of ilumi work great by themselves or as a team. small a21 - the flexible a21 ilumi rises like the sun over the horizon spreading bright light in all directions. the a21 ilumi is great for lamps, fan lighting, and most anywhere else in the home. the a21 produces about 800+ lumens while only consuming 10 watts. that's about 7x less energy than an equivalent 75 watt incandescent. ‚ large par30 - the powerful par30 ilumi shines down like bright light from the heavens (or your ceiling). the par30 ilumi is a flood light best for overhead, recessed, or track lighting. the par30 produces about 1100+ lumens while only consuming about 15 watts. that's about 7x less energy than an equivalent 100 watt incandescent. since inception, ilumi has evolved quite a bit while still retaining our‚ focus on brightness, simplicity, and experience. we've developed two iterations of working prototypes and now have the final design for both the a21 and par30 ready to go. ‚ check out the photos below to see the evolution of ilumi... behind ilumi is the ilumi app, which will be available as a free download in the app store or google play. ‚ like the lamps, the ilumi app has similarly evolved quite a bit as we've been working on it and with your feedback, we'll surely continue to refine it. ‚ ‚ ilumi is compatible with android bluetooth 4.0 (ble) phones and tablets plus iphone 4s, iphone 5, ipad 3 (retina display), and ipad mini. if you‚Äôre not sure if your android device supports ble,‚ check this website here . android just launched ble support this summer, and while we‚Äôre working on the android app, the ios app might ship first. we're also working on a software development kit (sdk) so others can come up with creative ways to use ilumi and share them with the ilumi nation. ‚ receive the ilumi sdk first by contributing to a 'light hacker kit' perk.‚ yes, ilumi is super cool, but it's also responsible. ‚ switching out your old light bulbs for ilumi will save you money on your electric bill, which is good for you and mother earth.‚ home lighting comprises about 1/4 of one's electric bill so it pays to practice energy efficiency.‚ by combining our advanced hyperlux led technology's efficiency with programming and automation functionality, ilumi is the most energy efficient light bulb in its class.‚ and every ilumi lasts up to 20 years. that means every ilumi pays for itself multiple times over through the course of its life.‚ changing out your old incandescent light bulb for a large 15 watt ilumi can save you about $265. switching out your small 10 watt ilumi for a 75 watt incandescent you can save about $190. from day one, our focus has been on making ilumi functional, flexible, and simple with a world class experience.‚ this ethos is apparent in everything from our hyperlux led technology to our automatic set-up process. we believe that this focus will not only ensure that ilumi will be a great product, but one that you‚Äôll have and enjoy for a long time. we've put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into ilumi...well figuratively, and we are so close to turning our dream into a bright reality. ‚ it takes a lot to manufacture a quality product, and while we are close, we need your help to get us over the last hump. ‚ there's tooling expenditures, cost of components, and manufacturing costs ahead, but also we‚ need your help to build a community around ilumi - the ilumi nation. in addition to your very helpful contribution, we're going to ask you for your advice and opinion before and after we ship ilumi. ‚ when you receive your ilumi, we are going to ask for your feedback. ‚ what bugs are you seeing, what do you like, &amp; what don't you like? further, we've only touched the surface of what ilumi can do. ‚ with your support you can use the ilumi sdk to come up with even more amazing lighting experiences. ‚ this is just the beginning, and together with your help we'll not only create a great product that we hope you'll love, but one that you've been a part of as a member of the ilumi nation. to give you an idea on where we are in our process and next steps, here's an overview of our timeline: the ilumi team is a combination of entrepreneurs, hackers, designers, and technologists. ‚ the team is led by co-founders corey egan and swapnil bora out of dallas, texas. swapnil and corey met as classmates at ut dallas where they came up with the idea in the fall of 2010 and won the utd business idea competition. ‚ partners: we've been fortunate to have the help of a number of different great partners both large and small. ‚ to name a few novation mobile has done a fantastic job helping us with developing the ilumi app, avnet electronics ‚ has helped us from day 1 to source the right components, and osram opto has been a great partner providing not only excellent led components but expertise and access to world class testing facilities.‚ team awards: finalist -

(2) prototype battery with printed circuit board regulated to output 1 amp based on the cross section of mobile devices targeted. (3) usb wall plug cap (4) battery housing with male usb throughput. juicebee technology juicebee uses lithium ion battery technology, coupled with advanced custom circuit design and enhanced safety features, that easily make it the champion of external batteries. why choose lithium ion? more stored energy can be held in a lithium ion battery per gram than other battery technologies per cost, thus making lithium ion a better choice. lithium ion batteries tend to hold a charge much longer than other battery technologies, making it a better emergency backup solution.‚ for example, it may lose only 2% of its charge per month. juicebee has no memory. what this means is that you do not have to fully cycle your battery, or discharge it fully before recharging as with some other batteries. juicebee can be charged hundreds of times more than other battery technologies. who we are juicebee is a new startup that focuses on designing innovative, portable power solutions for today‚Äôs mobile lifestyles. juicebee is a partnership founded by a group of longstanding friends that have unique and experienced disciplines, ranging from engineering, industrial design, graphics and international sales and marketing. adam and moez are entrepreneurs at heart, and have been designing products for a variety of tech companies for a number of years. adam has a degree in material sciences, and moez is an electrical engineer with extensive background in system design, user interface development and acoustic design. adam and moez always knew that they would eventually develop their own projects using their shared worldview and their passion for making beautifully designed, simple, smart and relevant accessory products for mobile lifestyles. adam and moez are the lead project developers for juicebee and believe that they have designed a superior portable power solution for most products in the battery backup space. juicebee is about delivering best-in-class, most innovative, coolest power solutions for the mobile road warrior. adam and moez are the lead project developers for juicebee and believe that they have designed a portable power solution that simply is a superior power solution to most products in the battery backup space. juicebee is about delivering best in class, most innovative, coolest power solutions for the mobile road warrior. 
 when i was growing up, i was always getting into things and taking them apart. i went through countless amounts of r/c cars. i would‚ take them apart to see how they worked and then i would see if i could put them back together. some were successful...others were not. through many trial and error periods, i had a great deal of "wouldn't it be cool if" moments. my father passed away when i was 5 years old, i was raised by my mother and grandmother, and we didn't have a garage or "shed". needless to say, most of my "wouldn't it be cool if" moments, fell by the wayside.‚ i am very blessed and thankful for how i was raised. i just wasn't around any "makers", so they couldn't relate. having a place to go, that allowed me to explore and answer my questions, would have been great! mix in actual resources for me to tinker and have hands on experience with, that would've been awesome! an actual place to make! maker kidz is that place i/we never had. a place where a child can take the steps to make their imagination into a reality. we strive to be on the cutting edge of all things steam (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) related, and up to date on the latest technology advancements. we also show appreciation for the evolving technology that has allowed us to make these innovative and creative steps. innovation is driven by creativity, thought, and education. we are the vehicle that helps usher in ideas that could one day change the world. the main focus of maker kidz is family and community. we are providing an opportunity for kids to come together, share ideas, and provide them with a safe outlet to learn about technology, or just making something. to be able to explore your own ideas without feeling overwhelmed or criticized means a lot to a child. it builds self esteem and confidence by showcasing their creativity without feeling shy about what they make. while we look for a permanent space to suit our needs, we will be doing pop up workshops at locations around annapolis. kids and families can come out and see what we are all about, the direction we're going, and make some pretty neat stuff! we will be using the money collected for‚ our first few‚ workshop supplies, and‚ 3d printers. items we are aiming to secure are.... printrbot simple kits makerbot replicator (stretch goal) littlebits‚ laser cutter (stretch goal) makedo arduino (stretch goal) circuit scribe and other various electronics, art supplies, creativity driven activities, and safety equipment that will go into our spaces for our events. we appreciate you backing our project. this is just the beginning, but the possibilities of where this could go are endless. your own "wouldn't it be cool if" moment is now here. and yes, it's very cool. ;0) also: big thanks to pimios ( www.pimios.com ) for the use of their maker faire clips.‚ they are doing some great things up‚ in pa. 
 what we want to build:‚ we want to create try ios , a code school course which teaches how to build your own iphone apps. our course will combine high quality screencasts, in-browser code challenges, and gamification principles to make learning fun. there will be no need to install anything, since students will build iphone apps using our in-browser iphone simulator (see the video above for a demo). update: what we'll do with extra funding you might notice that we already reached our funding goal, thanks if you already helped fund us! ‚ you can still secure your access to the course for $25 or more, and here are our additional funding goals: &gt; $75,000 - we'll hire a camera crew to do 2 "making of" videos during the course building process and we add video hints. basically if you get stuck during the challenges and need more explanation, we'll have instructors to explain topics in more detail. reached &gt; $100,000 - all of the above plus 2 additional levels of content and we also create the most awesome iphone development cheat sheet. reached &gt; $125,000 - we create a free try objective c course. just like tryruby.org , a free learn objective c course to learn the basics of the language. reached &gt; $150,000 - all $25 pledgers (and higher) get a free month of a code school subscription (which is worth $25). ‚ we have some great courses coming up, like ruby bits and assembling sass , as well as our current courses git real , real-time web with node.js , and journey into mobile , all of which you will have the chance to check out for free! when we will ship: this course will be teaching ios 6, the newest mobile platform from apple which (with any luck) will be released in october. last year, ios 5 was released at the same time as the new iphone 4s, at the beginning of october. so we would plan on shipping the early access beta of try ios in october, and the wide release a month later, in november. who are we and how will we do this? envy labs is a small web development consultancy in orlando, florida. from the consultancy we bootstrapped code school , which provides web development courses in the same format we want to teach iphone development (videos, in-browser coding, gamification). in the past year and a half we've released 13 courses including rails for zombies , journey into mobile web (shown below), real-time web with node.js , and more recently try git . all of our courses allow you to learn by doing , providing quick and accurate feedback as you code in your browser. we've always wanted to create an iphone course, but we knew it would only be worthwhile if we could show an iphone simulator in the browser as you wrote code... and we think we figured it out. recently, thomas meeks and eric allam from our team spent some weekends hacking on a prototype and came up with a way to offer an in-browser simulator. unfortunately, even though the result works (seen in the demo video above), the hardware and software costs are not small. this is why we're turning to kickstarter. where will the kickstarter money go? we will need about $20,000 for the mac mini "farm." this includes upfront costs for the mac minis, as well as bandwidth and colocation costs. the rest of your kickstarter pledge will go toward the development of the course. things like: the educational materials. the graphic design &amp; branding. coding up the in-browser challenges (usually the most expensive part). building and scaling the simulator technology. the front-end development. film production. refining the course based on feedback. ongoing support and hosting. if we raise additional funding than our ask we'll simply add additional levels of content, so please help us spread the word. do i need to know any programming for this course? a little, you'll need to have a basic knowledge of programming, any language will do. ‚ for instance, we're not going to teach what strings, methods, and classes are. ‚ we'll leave that to codecademy , which is free. if you have any other questions about how we will be using the kickstarter money, or about what goes into building a code school course, please don't hesitate to ask below. faq will the course videos include captions/subtitles? yes. we plan on supporting multiple languages in our videos using subtitles. if you d like to &quot;vote&quot; for your language, please just send us a message and let us know. we ll do our best. last updated: mon, aug 13 2012 11:19 am edt will you ship internationally? for t-shirts and patches we can ship internationally, but to help cover the costs we ask that you add $5 to the pledge. so instead of pledging $60 for the try ios t-shirt, you could pledge $65. we won t not ship internationally if you pledge $60, but it d help out the project if you added that $5. thanks! last updated: mon, aug 13 2012 11:19 am edt will the course itself cost anything when it s released? yes, the course will be for sale on http://codeschool.com when it is released in november. we are not sure exactly how much it will cost, but we know it will be more than the $25 is costs to get access to the course by pledging here on kickstarter. for reference, most of our courses cost $55. last updated: mon, jul 30 2012 7:14 am edt why do you need this money you guys are a for profit business? most of our courses do take a lot of time and money to build, and we ve been able to fund those courses by charging money. but there is a much larger initial capital investment to build an ios course like the one we want to build. we had a couple of different ideas on how to raise the money, from taking out a loan, to getting a more traditional vc or angel investment. we decided to try the kickstarter approach so we could get funding from the people who would actually want the course. last updated: mon, jul 30 2012 9:35 am edt what does the rails for zombies t-shirt look like?

 we‚ believe‚ anyone should be free in how they‚ use‚ their‚ devices. we also believe that writing applications and games on an open-source platform is a great way to learn programming, for both kids and adults. we have built fez game-o from the ground up with these two beliefs in mind. ‚ fez game-o is an open-source hand-held programmable console. ‚ with it you can accomplish more in less time as it is programmed using microsoft's visual studio, in‚ c# and visual basic (.net). these are the same tools that professionals use today to create all kinds of applications and‚ games for windows pcs.‚ a developer who knows c# or vb already knows how‚ to program the fez game-o and a beginner learning c# or vb on fez game-o can use that same knowledge to program a pc. the goal of fez game-o is not to compete with other closed-source platforms or to sell overly priced games. instead, we want to‚ build an open-source platform with a community‚ where you will‚ obtain the application for free and even‚ receive‚ the source code of that application as well. we want you to share your work, learn from and improve other's work ... this is the fez game-o‚ mentality.‚ the hardware fez game-o hosts a stm32f407 32-bit 168mhz‚ cortex-m4 processor‚ with 1mb of flash and a 320 x 240 parallel tft display. this may not seem like much compared to today's 3d standards for closed-source gaming consoles but fez game-o's specs are much more powerful than classic gaming consoles.‚ we want this console to be simple to hack, simple to understand and simple to program. you should be able to get setup and able to write your own application or game in the first day. key features: cortex-m4 168mhz microprocessor 1024kb flash 192kb ram 320 x 240 16-bit tft display 3d accelerometer (tilt sensor) speaker volume control usb connection (for loading and debugging applications) bluetooth option jtag/swd (for advanced users) runs off 3xaaa batteries the software by default, fez game-o ships loaded with the .net micro framework (netmf) system, which allows developers to connect it to a pc using a usb cable then use visual studio (even the free express version) to program it, using c# or visual basic. in contrast with typical "small system" programming, like arduino or mbed, netmf allows for run-time debugging, from stepping through code to inspecting variables. ‚ the netmf core libraries and the fez game-o drivers are completely open source. advanced users there are many options for advanced users. for example, the core libraries include a feature that allows users to load native code within netmf code (runtime loadable procedures) where game logic can be done with managed c# or vb but the‚ critical‚ inner loops can be done in c or assembly. ‚ this is similar to how dlls function on pcs. below is an example of a 3d software raycast rendering. also with an available‚ jtag/swd connection, developers can load any arm cortex-m4 compiled-code on the core micro-controller, using their favorite ide or even using the command line with gcc compiler. screenshots how does this compare to‚ the console‚ my kids use? it actually does not compare at all. unlike closed-source platforms, with fez game-o there are no ndas or legal strangle holds. ‚ we openly provide you with all the tools necessary to start creating applications or games directly "out of the box".‚ ‚ also, typical consumer consoles are very complex to program and need large operating systems to run, typically developed by multiple professionals with large budgets.‚ the goal with fez game-o is to create applications and games that can be programmed, maintained and improved by a single person. this does not mean you can't create some impressive applications and games. this console is much more‚ powerful‚ than the commodore‚ 64 for example‚ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commodore_64 how do we handle graphics?

 what is donut dash? inspired by the simple game play of "flappy bird" and sweet cuteness of "candy crush" donut dash is my new app that i've been developing part-time. the first release will be in about a month and will be completely free to download. their are no in-app purchase but their are some ads. first release will involve 72 different levels. why am i doing this? i've been told that making an app is only half the work. the other half is getting it out their and after already releasing three other apps i've come here not to fund the app but to get it out their. to get it notice. what will the funds be used for? adding the manufacturing cost, the shipping cost, fees associated with the website and a small margin in exchange rates leaves very little to nothing left over. i didn't come here to raise money to make an app. i came here to get the app out their before its released. what you get? only one thing possible and thats one 8gb purple wizard usb 2.0 stick shown in the pictures below. its custom made based upon the wizard in the game. 
 * new project update s ! the new early bird special reward gets you project sierra for just $45 and is limited to the first 50 backers. next up is the kickstarter special reward ‚Äì it gets you project sierra for $50 and it‚Äôs unlimited! we‚Äôve eliminated all project sierra subscription fees ‚Äì they‚Äôre no more! that means once you purchase the project sierra network encryption device, you‚Äôre ready to securely surf the web with no additional monthly fees! project sierra ‚Äì security simplified project sierra is a consumer-grade, android-based, plug-and-play network device that connects to a global network which enables you to‚ use the internet anonymously and encrypt all of your network traffic. unlike other web anonymity systems, project sierra is affordable and easy to use. with no prior knowledge of web security or proxy use, you can protect your data and internet use from ‚Äútraffic analysis‚Äù by simply plugging project sierra into your modem and joining the sierra network. this system is able to encrypt data and web usage on any device connected to the modem‚Äôs internet. project sierra uses an international network of proxies to allow you to run your data through a third party ip address and protect your location. you may already have software or a browser add-on that helps with this, but project sierra is the only simple solution that protects all of your traffic from all of your devices. browser add-ons only protect the traffic that‚Äôs routing through your browser, so chat applications, email clients and more are still vulnerable. beyond that, any software installed on your computer doesn‚Äôt protect your data that you‚Äôre sending from your phone, tablet or other devices. what makes project sierra unique: affordable easy to install requires no previous computer or encryption knowledge covers multiple devices at once connects directly to your modem why do you need project sierra? with project sierra, anyone can enjoy the benefits of web anonymity and traffic encryption by simply plugging in the device. as the internet becomes a more integral part of society, so do its risks. tech-savvy internet users have been aware of the dangers of unprotected ip addresses for years and have been securing their data by using proxies, vncs, ssh tunnels, and other complex means to gain anonymity.‚ project sierra seeks to bring this same level of security to everyone, even if you didn‚Äôt understand what you just read! so what is at risk? when you access the internet, it‚Äôs through a local and specialized ip address. every modem has its own address which is also connected to the local isp. so any information sent from your home can be intercepted by even the most inexperienced hackers or data thieves. most cyber-attacks are directed at your known ip address. when you create a connection between your computer and the project sierra servers, your home network is given a layer of security that you do not currently have. your information will not be seen, only the project sierra server ip will be visible to the world. this protects your data from being vulnerable to ‚Äútraffic analysis‚Äù which allows hackers and other third parties to access information about your location, spending habits, and behaviors. websites, such as shodan, have made it easier than ever for third parties to access private information through the internet. with shodan, anyone with basic computer knowledge can easily search through a database of online systems and gain access to them with a click. these systems can be anything, from the central heating system of an elementary school, to the wireless baby monitor that sits in your child‚Äôs bedroom and even your own laptop or cell phone camera. privacy is harder to ensure than ever, project sierra seeks to make privacy easy. what you‚Äôre vulnerable to without project sierra‚ geographically restricted internet access- throttling people intercepting information between your computer and the final location ‚ ‚ ‚ credit card numbers ‚ ‚ ‚ banking information‚ ‚ ‚ social security numbers‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ private pictures, videos or emails‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ geographic location third parties tracking your internet history and search queries ‚ hackers connecting to personal online devices ‚ ‚ ‚ baby monitors ‚ ‚ ‚ security cameras ‚ ‚ ‚ central air systems ‚ ‚ ‚ cell phones, laptops and tablets the sierra network the sierra network runs your ip address through third party proxy servers to allow you secure and anonymous web access. the network is based on https security protocol, making the level of security identical to standard https websites like banks or email accounts, which makes it very difficult to spy on or throttle users with project sierra. also, users will be able to choose the country where the traffic/connection is established, allowing you to bypass geographic restrictions and protect your location. specs user interface competitors about us my name is kerry c. cox, jr. and i am the founder of simplified network solutions, llc and the lead designer of project sierra. my combined experience comes from more than 10 years serving in the u.s. army, working for fortune 500 companies, and government institutions. i have been involved in designing, deploying, and managing mission critical systems and networks. my love for computers and curiosity of how they work has inspired me to create project sierra in order to protect one‚Äôs identity and location online. my ultimate goal with this project is to provide the average person with the comfort of security. 
 one of the biggest problems in my home and office is paper. it's everywhere and we have to either deal with it or find somewhere to file it. it's not good for us and its not good for the environment. traditional email has gone someway to solving the problem but wouldn't it be great if every physical location had an email address associated with it? we are creating an email address for every physical location which can be used by anyone to send appropriate material to the household. bank statements, utility bills, announcements etc can all be sent to the email address instead of physically printing and posting and using natural resources. but how will all this work? how do we know the intended recipient will receive the mail piece? everyone will be encouraged to claim their email address however in the event that an email address is unclaimed the system reverts back to printing and posting the mail piece with a cover note encouraging the householder to register for future mail. the email accounts will be free and a system has been designed to ensure the mail ends up in the hands of the correct recipient and can be transferred when moving home. the system will be funded via the revenue generated from the printed and posted items (the sender will pay) in order to make it financially viable.

 monitor the world around you ... even when you're not around! the internet continues to change everything, and combined with our mobile lifestyles things are getting very cool!‚ we're about to make your life and world a whole lot cooler!‚ welcome to wovyn !‚ with your help, we're building a new solution that is enabling the "internet of things" like nothing else. first, we'll let you scatter wireless sensors all over your home or business ... or even outdoors.‚ no, not just one or two types of sensors, but we're starting with 13 types now, and have 17 more in design ... and more of them are on the way. second, we let you create rules of what you want wovyn to do when it senses different things. ‚ sure, we can do email, sms, twitter and facebook, but we also allow you to connect to several of the top internet data services like pachube (now cosm), sen.se, thingspeak, and kynetx with a few clicks on our portal!‚ simple! third ... and this is where it really gets good ... we provide full support for rest/webhooks, eventedapi, and mqtt so that you can point wovyn and your sensor data at your own software ... or at software that we haven't even thought of yet!‚ (scott even has some evil genius ideas on where he wants to take this!) we've already been talking with dozens of software developers who are coming up with all sorts of ideas of how they can use all of this sensor data and provide you with new services! wait, you haven't heard of the "internet of things"? well, good thing you came here! dave found this really awesome video from ibm that does a great job of explaining some of what you can expect to see in the future ... and that is the future we're building at wovyn.‚ check it out: _____________________________________________________ it's not "the internet of thing"! look - the future isn't about the "internet of thing" ... its the "internet of things"!‚ plural!‚ multiple!‚ and we've designed wovyn to be exactly that.‚ wovyn is an extensible solution that lets you add numerous sensors - up to 50 of them per gateway - of all different types.‚ and then to create rules of all kinds that can notify you ... or push their data into any software you want that might do even more complex things. if you want to know if your freezer door is open or your basement is flooding or if your front door just opened, that's three separate sensors - wovyn allows you to do all that for under $200!‚ and the best part is that you can just keep adding new sensors to wovyn! what are we offering? for this project, we are offering the rewards listed over to the right to kickstart your desires to have the world talk back to you. ‚ we are offering over a dozen sensors in two groups - you pick your desired sensor(s) from below - and a choice of two gateways through which to connect. the sensors consist of: group "a" wireless sensors: temperature sensor ( -20‚∞c to 60‚∞c) water sensor (presence or‚ absence) active id sensor dry contact sensor 0-20 ma current sensor analog voltage sensor group "b" wireless sensors: temperature sensor with 3-foot external probe light sensor (binary on/off) magnetic open/closed sensor (entry/window) magnetic presence sensor activity sensor accelerometer button sensor (immediate notification) find full descriptions of the group a &amp; b sensors here note: in all of the rewards we're offering, the above sensors are the 1" cube size, and include the 2032 coin cell battery. the next set of sensors in design include: 120 vac analog voltage detection, 500 vac/vdc analog voltage measurement, humidity sensor (rh), humidity sensor (rh) - high accuracy, vehicle presence, compass, flex, lux, grains per pound, infrared motion, high temperature, low temperature, liquid level, liquid/gas/vapor pressure‚ (if we can blow out our funding scott thinks we can get these done by october also!) gateway choices (either supports up to 50 sensors): usb gateway (below) ‚ - this tiny device connects to your windows, mac or linux computer, and includes the wireless receiver radio. just run our wovyn usb gateway software and you're up and talking! wifi gateway (in video) ‚ - this stand-alone device (about the size of 2 decks of cards) includes the wireless receiver radio and wifi built in. after initial setup, it won't require any other device to operate, and is perfect for production installations. what services do you talk to? more like which ones don't ‚ we talk to? :) for the consumer crowd out there, wovyn sensors will speak to you via:‚ email email to sms text twitter facebook and others to come. for the hacker community, go crazy!‚ point wovyn at these initial hosted platforms: pachube ‚ (now cosm)‚ - see our public demo page here sen.se - see our public demo page here thingspeak kynetx knowledgeblue or write your own code, and have it talk to your software using: rest / webhooks eventedapi mqtt these are all configured using our cloud-based portal called the loom . (rob has been going crazy to get the loom working, trying to understand scott's constantly evolving design, and making dave's requested feature changes!) a note about our sensors and plan: these aren't ideas we dreamt up last night, or have scribbled on a white board somewhere. ‚ these are real, live, working sensors, and our gateways are operating now connected to many of the platforms you see listed above.‚ we have already secured quotes and agreements with the u.s. contract manufacturers we intend to use to deliver all kickstarters your chosen pledge level rewards. we also have our board designs complete, and have already been through several initial board revisions.‚ once funded we'll submit our boards to production, and it's estimated that worst case the production runs will take 12 weeks to build and deliver to us.‚ so this project is to launch into our first volume production run ... and that is where we need your support! bottom line: since we like to hack on cool stuff, there's one thing we know about the creative, diy and hacker communities ... we don't like waiting around for stuff!‚ we've done everything we could do in advance until this 'stuff' was ready to go before launching. our target is to finish the gateways and loom work by july, and provided we don't run into supply chain issues, we'd love to be one of the kickstarter projects that delivers early!! ‚ therefore, we are being conservative in our delivery estimates of october 2012. we hope you appreciate the effort, 'cause we sure appreciate the support! talk to us - tell us what you think we believe in the interactive nature of the kickstarter community, and will do the best we can to keep up with your comments and questions. ‚ thanks for your time, your attention, and of course your support - kickstarters pwn! faq what is the difference between you and twine? this is actually a popular question, and we ll do our best to answer it with some specific points: 1. wovyn is a next generation operating system for the internet of things. we are not just selling sensors ... our loom software is an extensible platform designed to connect almost any sensor or control system, to any cloud service or software application. what you see today is a small example of the sensors we can support, and just the beginning of the services and protocols that we ll support. 2. our sensors are not integrated into the core gateway (loom) but instead can be spread all over the place, and communicate back using a 900/868/433mhz radio. and that is just the first sensor topology that we are going to support. 3. our sensors are available in two different indoor form factors, plus fully outdoor enclosures. 4. we have a broader range of fully wireless sensors, and more coming. 5. we have two kinds of gateways (looms): our usb works with pc/mac/linux, and the wi-fi is standalone. 6. we do not force all communications to go out to our cloud service. our loom configuration portal is simply for configuration. once configured, the loom communicates directly to the configured end-points. last updated: thu, may 24 2012 1:00 am edt is there a cost for the wovyn loom configuration cloud service? no. we are not charging any additional fees for use of the loom configuration portal and cloud service. this service is used to configure your looms, to store the configuration, and generate notifications to you when critical events occur. last updated: wed, may 23 2012 12:49 am edt do you route all of my configured sensor communications through your cloud service? no. this is core to our architecture, and how we see the internet of things actually scaling! once a loom/gateway is configured, it communicates directly with the configured end-points. we do not believe that the internet of things is going to scale if all communications are required to flow through a single cloud service. last updated: wed, may 23 2012 12:52 am edt ask a question

 before i start, i want to thank the musopen.org for making the music used in the slide show freely available! i also thank dr. m. jones for providing me with the good-natured photographs of her, and mr. k. kelling for taking the photographs of me and my colleagues.the drawing, insects prepare for war, is by granville, 1842. the project: conservation starts with education and stewards of history. the desire to conserve begins with knowledge and an appreciation for the importance and diversity of species. the communities of the northern boreal forests and tundras of the north remain understudied. we know even less about their insect inhabitants of these regions so critical to our planet's health. these regions have also had less sampling of insect populations than in more temperate regions, thus the boreal forests remain a treasure trove for new information about insect diversity and adaptation. danks (1989) estimated that about 22,000 insect species make their homes in the boreal forests, far fewer than in more southern temperate zones‚ with your sponsorship, i plan to travel to north dakota and manitoba to collect insects from a wide range of ecosystems. these insects will become the basis for a study collection for students of noble international university (niu). why bugs? universities maintain and use insect collections to teach students about insect life, to introduce them to the wide world of biodiversity, and to prepare them potential employment in the many fields that involve insects. insects have a multi-billion dollar impact on our economy each year (economic entomology). agriculture, forestry, and medicine are just a few of the fields with opportunities for students well versed in entomology. more than any other type of land organism, insects have succeeded and diversified. although large vertebrates capture the imagination of the public more often, insects often act as accurate bellwethers (indicator species) of environmental conditions. more so than larger animals, small invertebrates also tend to function as keystones of their environments. they pollinate plants (e.g., bees and moths), decompose dead organisms (e.g., burying beetles), and form mutualist relationships (e.g., pastoral ants with aphids and bees with flowers). the parasitic life style of tachinid flies and ichneumonid wasps makes them important natural controls for many agricultural pests, and an important counterbalance to plant-eating insects in natural settings. ‚ insect images set 2 the project will have a strong focus the northern boreal forests of northern manitoba and the deciduous forests of north dakota. there is also a stretch goal to extend the north dakota collection into the short-grass prairies and badlands of western north dakota. in addition, i will be photographing insects, producing images for the niu students, for my kickstarter rewards, and for my own photography portfolio. i can then use this last set of images to raise funds for future research. i will start my expedition by scouting for insects in north dakota and along the interlake manitoba route to thompson mb. this path gives a longitudinal collection, with much boreal forest and muskeg, but also with systems that vary from northern deciduous forest and wetlands to old-growth coniferous forests. i will collect insects by using conventional techniques, such as a sweep net, drag cloth, aerial net and light traps.‚ should any of those specimens be rare they will not be collected, but photographed and released instead. why this project? currently, niu does not have a comprehensive insect collection for use with our students. five years ago, i successfully developed teaching collections for biology students of northeastern illinois university (chicago, illinois). i now propose to use those skills and experience to develop a teaching and research collection for students of noble international university. fewer schools have access to insect collections from northern boreal forests than access to insects from the midwestern states and southern canada. thus, niu will also gain the advantage of being able to increase their collection by the exchange of specimens with researchers at other universities. these recipients will likewise increase their collections. it is a win-win situation for all institutions involved. the process takes effort. there is scouting, collecting, sorting, pinning, and, identification of many individual insects down to the genus and species level. eventually, we also hope to digitize many of these insects and make them available online. all this takes experience, work, travel, dedication, passion, much more work, and money. with your help through kickstarter, i will build a teaching and research collection for the students of noble international university (niu). i cannot do it alone. i need your help to bridge the funding gap for this research. more than any other type of land organism, insects have succeeded and diversified. although large vertebrates capture the imagination of the public more often, insects often act as accurate bellwethers (indicator species) of environmental conditions. more so than larger animals, small invertebrates also tend to function as keystones of their environments. they pollinate plants (e.g., bees and moths), decompose dead organisms (e.g., burying beetles), and form mutualist relationships (e.g., pastoral ants with aphids and bees with flowers). the parasitic life style of tachinid flies and ichneumonid wasps makes them important natural controls for many agricultural pests, and an important counterbalance to plant-eating insects in natural settings. stretch goal #1: an exploratory journey to churchill if i exceed my funding goal by $1000, i can add an exploratory trip to churchill manitoba. there, i can make contact with the churchill northern studies centre to explore the logistics of collecting on the tundra next year and of bringing a group of students to the tundra for a university class in arctic entomology, perhaps as early as the 2015-2016 field season. about 1500 of canada's 30,000 known insect species have been reported multiple times above the tree line of the arctic. this small number includes fewer families of insects. the diptera (mosquitoes and other flies) and the parasitoid hymenoptera (wasps) have become more diverse, filling many of the niches held by different families in the south. this situation parallels darwin's observation that finches filled the many niches of other birds in the galapagos islands. why does the project give "flin flon" as the study location?‚ i will be collecting over a wide geographic range, but a good chunk of my time will in the provincial lands that lie between thompson and flin flon manitoba. thompson was not on the list of cities that kickstarter allows as locations. now for the good stuff: thank-you rewards. as i worked on my ph.d. in zoology, i also took art classes at toronto's three schools of art, and i studied with l. e. wakeland. i continued my art training upon my return to the chicagoland area by taking art classes at the college of dupage and the chicago botanical gardens. because most people are not particularly interested in receiving bugs in the mail-- and because i am not licensed to send bugs through the mail-- i am offering my art work- both existing works and works produced for this study and during this study-- to my benefactors. i hope i've convinced you this is a worthwhile project and that you will be getting a good return for your investment-- both in terms of the thank you gifts and in the good feeling you'll get from helping many students from many regions. so long and thanks again for your help!

 many people already speak a little english, enough to get by on trips, sing along to music and may be get the general gist of what is being said in movies but often this is not enough to understand technical, legal or more complicated material they need at work, for which a large vocabulary maybe needed! now, imagine a language simple enough to be learnt quickly by anybody. imagine a language elaborate enough to convey any idea and concept.‚ imagine a universal language that everybody in the‚ world could speak to communicate easily. this language exists. it is called basic english. combine it with an‚ efficient tool to convert any english language text into basic english and you obtain the perfect coupling for successful across-continents communications. this is when simplish comes in. the goal at the goodwill company, we want to ease the understanding between people. we believe that the world deserves a good tool to enable communication without misinterpretation.‚ our goal is to allow anybody to communicate together without effort and avoid the lost in translation issue. we think that basic english is the‚ common denominator‚ between people, since english is the international language and basic english can be learnt in one month by anybody. then you just have to convert your english text into basic english and the non-native english speakers can understand you perfectly even though the content might be complex. be patient, you'll know what basic english is in two minutes ! the motivation have you ever been convinced by the result of a translation tool? me, never. today's translation tools are good for‚ single words or maybe a phrase . but what about a whole text? what about complex, technical content? you won't understand anything from the result. but this is normal. the reason is that two distinct languages are way too different regarding the rules of grammar and the existence of homonyms that prevent simple, one-to-one word substitution. people who learned another language will know this. if teams at google or ibm haven't succeeded yet in releasing a reliable translation tool, you can see the picture of how tough it is. well, let me tell you that we have found a way to convert text ‚Äì even complicated text ‚Äì without losing information in the process.‚ the babel language basic english is the result of mr. charles kay ogden's work in the 1930's. he made up a version of english that contains only 1,000 essential words with which you can say anything you normally say. he also developed a course to teach basic english in a month. today, it is especially taught in asia using this universal and efficient‚ course . in a world where every second counts, it is important to learn fast and well. we used this reduced vocabulary as target language. moreover, we added 30,000 scientific words defined using the 1,000 essential words. check out the complete alphabetic list ‚ of those words and read further information about basic english . the tool the tool we have developed is called simplish. it works quite well actually. you enter some text or upload some files to translate them in basic english. if you try it, you'll see this result.‚ we use this color code to ease the reading. with simplish you can also add words to your personal dictionary to adapt it to your knowledge or the knowledge of the people you are writing to.‚ we also provide online the complete basic english course with the 45 steps to learn or teach basic english.‚ if you are interested, you should try simplish .‚ we are currently also working on an android app for this course that has voice recognition to check pronunciation, grammar checker, text-to-speech and a conversational agent to chat with! well, that's quite good, isn't it ? but still not perfect. the users examples are sometimes better than a detailed explanation. i'll present five different cases where simplish would be very useful. an entrepreneur dealing with china your business is the design of tiny projectors that you can connect to your mobile phone. you have raised enough funds on kickstarter and you are ready for production. the items are made in china and you have to firm a contract with your chinese corespondent who knows some english but not enough to understand the legal file you are giving him. simplish can translate the whole document and you will hand in two versions of the contract ‚Äì the english one and the basic english one ‚Äì both containing the exact same information avoiding further legal issue and an expensive translation into chinese. a man with the rna virus of the orthomyxoviridae family your doctor just announced you had the most aggressive rna virus of orthomyxoviridae family. shocked and afraid you decide to search the internet for more information about this virus. after reading multiple articles about the disease and don't understand a word of what it is, you use simplish to simplify one of them and benefit the 30,000 scientific words explained to find out you have the flu. a journal writer writer for a famous international newspaper, you want to write for a larger number of persons. being a renowned financial audit expert, your articles are of high-level and translating them requires top-quality translators in various languages. however, using simplish, you create a second version of your article that you can publish side by side with your original article targeting a broader public. perhaps the basic english version won't be marked by your so unique style, but the content will unaltered. a message to a foreign friend it's been a while since you haven't heard anything from your friend pierre-alain de moulinsart who lives in paris. your french is a bit lost in the the past so you use google translate to send him an email. two days later, you receive a weird message from pierre-alain telling he won't talk to you anymore. a bit confused, you try to read the translation and find out you insulted him ! using simplish you wouldn't have changed the meanings of your words and your friend, even though french and not good with languages, would have understood you. a medicine student struggling with an anatomy course your day was long and tough. arriving home, you have to study the anatomy course you just followed and don't understand anything it says. after looking for every terms you could understand, you are about to implode because everything is confused in your mind. that is when you enter the text in simplish and read the simplified version that provide all the definition using simpler words. now you can phagocytize the whole book without difficulty and without missing any important point. that was for native english speakers . in the same manner, simplish has of course great value for non-native english speakers . actually, it has maybe even a higher interest for them. they can understand anything they read although they have only a little knowledge of english. with the emergence of brazil, russia, india and china, the implications are huge for text translators because a giant niche is growing. in 2011, 5 million indian students graduated. english being the international and scientific language , imagine how important it is for those people to understand technical content. and this is just an example... the issues let's see why we are not fully satisfied. you will notice that the text might be quite difficult to read because of the errors in the translation.‚ take a look at the example we provided. you can see for instance that platform has been interpreted as operating system ‚ and that the plural‚ noun projects has been translated as if it was the third-person singular‚ of the verb ‚ to project ‚Äì however the second appearance of the term has been interpreted correctly.we can see that, even though it works out well in most of the cases, in some other ones our dictionary is not complete enough and that the ambiguities are not always well resolved yet. as well, the grammar checker is not perfect since films, games, ...‚ has been transformed into‚ filmsgames even tough they are recognized as two different words ‚Äì check it with the actual translation on the website, the tooltips are displayed adequately. basically, at the moment, if you don't correct it you can't use the resulting text "out-of-the-box", which is our objective. the improvements ‚ so what we need to improve is: the resolution of ambiguity the grammar checker final tidy-up module the general dictionary the scientific dictionary the legal dictionary minor software issues when we say dictionaries, we mean defining the english words in terms of basic english ones to carry out substitutions or explain them in footnotes.‚ well, this might seem complicated but it is not. the reason is that most of the computing part (mathematics, algorithms and coding) is done ! we mainly need to improve the databases that contain the dictionaries and checkers. and for this, we must translate books from english to basic english, correct the results word by word and update these databases! we have started to do this work but it is slow since we don't have the highly-trained human resources to finish it in a reasonable amount of time: keeping our current rhythm, we will be done in a looong time... concretely every book we translated and loaded in the database brought about a big change in the accuracy of translation. we calculate that with 10 more books translated and corrected, and the tool will be 99.99% correct. therefore, we want to build a small team of: 6 native english speakers translating and correcting each one or 2 books 1 person taking care of ambiguity resolution and fine grammar issues 1-2 developer(s) to implement those changes and do minor improvements during 6 months each, and we are done with an amazing service that efficiently and without errors translates texts from english to basic english. only 8 people for 6 months to complete 7 years of research and development. concretely, we need your support to pay those people and other related expenses.‚ it will not be a tough task to find them since we don't need nobel prized physicists, but well-educated individuals with a broad education level good enough to edit sophisticated english writing. thank you very much ! we don't mean to kill the language diversity on earth that is essential to keep all the amazing cultures and their differences intact, but our efforts are leading to ease the universal communication between human beings and the general comprehension of any type of content, regardless of complexity. in a highly-connected, globalized world, this challenge is today‚ undeniable. i would like to thank you very much for your support and interest in this project! "but who are you?" we have offices in guildford, england and guadalajara, mexico. we are a small team of young, and some not-so-young, dynamic engineers, physicists and computer scientists and even a lawer from different places in the world: mexico, italy, argentina, switzerland, england... cheers! rewards we offer as a reward, premium accounts on simplish. this account has these benefits : unlimited online translations unlimited file uploads manage your files personal dictionary to adapt the system normal and basic accounts have limited translations and uploads. besides, they don't allow to manage the files or have a personal dictionary. a site license allows you to distribute premium accounts to your whole company.‚ a law firm, for instance, could then use it to translate their papers into basic english and provide two versions to their non-english speaking clients! the t-shirts looks like this : we worked with hugo boss to design them. it is gonna be in their next fashion collection. no kidding :)

 it's time to give kickstarter fans something to get excited about! what if there was a new way to get out on the water without the hassle and expense of boating? what if we could open water sports up to everyone, not just a privileged few? and what if we could save lives and the environment at the same time? it's no longer a dream, kymera is a revolutionary solution, not to one, but all of these problems. kymera is small enough to fit in almost any vehicle, light enough to be carried by hand, and its simple design makes it a fraction of the cost of anything currently available. better still, kymera‚Äôs electric drive train makes it totally eco friendly and its unique heads up riding position gives you a ride like no other! all fun aside, with your support we will also help rescue swimmers reach drowning victims faster, by giving them the power they need when and where they need it. but we can't do it with out you! the back story the tide turns it took 7 prototypes, a decade of r&amp;d, and a team of experts, but the results have been nothing less than extraordinary. being electric and only 48lbs, kymera can be hand carried to the water, eliminating the need for a tow vehicle, trailer, launch ramp, gas, and hassle in general! ‚ brace yourself! the flip the switch-and-go convenience along with the lack of noise and fumes will take some getting used to, but we're pretty sure your going to love it!‚ with its small size you can store it almost anywhere. opening up water sports to everyone - even if you live in small home or apartment.‚ we take safety seriously! since the 1980's watercraft manufactures have been trapped in an arms race, building bigger, faster, more powerful pwc's every year. the most recent has topped the supercharged 300hp mark, with a top speed over 70mph and a fuel tank larger than most suv's. with the bigger more commanding crafts, they have continued to push the speed to maintain the thrill. kymera takes the opposite approach. much as a go-cart at 30mph can feel faster than a ferrari at 100mph, kymera's heads up riding position gives you all the thrill while maintaining a safe speed. ‚ kymera is undeniably fun, but its utility to the brave men and women who risk their own lives to save others couldn't be ignored. immediately after our first publication we were flooded with stories of close calls and grim outcomes from search and rescue teams. ‚ they pleaded that we see kymera through to production. from that moment, the project took on a new meaning. ‚ every day since we've been left struggling with how many sons, daughters, moms and dads could have been saved if they only had the right tools. your pledges will not only take the hassle out of getting out on the water, you will be directly funding the tooling needed to fast track kymera into the hands of search and rescue teams around the world.‚ so how will funding kymera help? typical water rescue equipment consists of a $20,000 personal watercraft or a $3500 paddle board. the paddle board is easily accessible, but it's slow and requires a huge amount of the rescue swimmers energy. the ski is fast but at 1000lbs+ in most cases, critical minutes are lost getting it into the water. kymera is the best of both worlds since it is easily carried to the water without the need of a launch ramp. ‚ kymera allows rescue swimmers to reach victims fast and allows them to be ready to act. it also became obvious that the remote control feature developed in early 2005 for testing would be a great addition. ‚ this will give rescuers the option to deliver flotation and deploy ropes to struggling swimmers without having to enter the water. the optional, detachable, fold out rescue sled will allow rescue swimmers to quickly recover victims, saving critical minutes. with your support and a successfully funded project, we will be able to supply affordable rescue models as soon as our rewards have been fulfilled.‚ we have been fortunate enough to get real insight from expert search and rescue teams.‚ discovery channel was there to help us spread the word! stepping up it is not often in life we are presented with the opportunity to help save others, much less have fun in the process. ‚ however, this is exactly kymera's kickstarter goal. by supporting our project you will not only support an eco friendly watercraft as a safer alternative to existing technology. ‚ you will also be providing the means of delivering an affordable tool to those tasked with responding in the most desperate moments of need.‚ with your pledges we will first finalize the hull design and work with our manufacture to perfect our polyurethane hull rotomolding tooling (as used in white water kayaks). this will greatly improve durability and reduce part cost. ‚ we expect this process to be the most lengthy. it will take approximately 6 weeks until the first part is produced and will be capable of 100 hulls per week going forward. the second major investment will be our custom built electric drive system injection molding tooling. currently, the upfront investment has been prohibitive however, with your support we will reach our goal. ‚ this will reduce the weight and unit cost simultaneously. we have been told to expect a 4~6 week lead time given the complex tooling requiring multiple "sliders". however, once produced, this tooling will allow for 100's of units per week. increasing our order quantities will help reduce cost and allow us to negotiate specific component improvements. ‚ specifically, increased water-cooling and higher grade materials. batteries being a major portion of the unit cost will also benefit greatly from larger orders. ‚ battery lead times have been very short, but require hands on assembly and enclosure. we will be stockpiling and prepping many of the "off the shelf" components while we are awaiting the arrival of our custom components. to keep our initial tooling costs at a minimum and reduce lead times, we will be taking advantage of the latest in desktop printing when possible. although relatively a "slow" process, the low cost will allow us to run multiple units around the clock and allow changes / improvements on the fly. other smaller drive train (drive shaft, coupler, throttle etc) components will be cnc'd by a local partner shop who has quick turn arounds that we have worked with for years. we are proud to support our local community and having a personal relationship with a strategic partner is always a huge asset.‚ the rewards! show your support! let everyone know you helped start a revolution and are doing your part to save lives with our sincere thanks for your contribution!‚ with a product as cool as kymera, you have to have cool swag to go with it! strapped for cash? no worries, tell a friend, post on facebook, or just shout kymera from the rooftops and we'll send you a decal just for helping spread the word! every dollar counts and will go straight to the tooling needed to get kymera into full production! kymera decal kymera key floaty‚ kymera tee kymera rescue team‚ your on the team! with a pledge of $50 or more, you will not only receive the kymera rescue tee, you will also be listed as an honorary member of the kymera rescue team. your name will appear alongside the names of those from around the world who have been saved with your support! all rescue team members will also be given first priority on the public release boards! the kymera system‚ picture a crowded beach with masses of people gathered at the waters edge. the stifling heat of summer beats down as you make you're way to the water, kymera in hand, heads turn, captivated by the lone rider and this strange new board. curiosity quickly turns to shock, as the impossibly small craft comes to life and you jet off into the distance. its truly an amazing experience that we can't wait to share with everyone! specs 48lbs (aprox) only 29lbs~ with battery removed!‚ 76"x 24"x 9" overall size super durable roto-molded hull (as used in white water kayaks) note* the polyurethane hull will not be painted, but will have graphics available in high visibility "rescue orange" ‚ (see stretch goals below) swappable 1000wh lithium polymer battery pack included (300 ~400 ‚ cycles average with proper charging) 2,000w peak 1,000w rms brushless motor (for nearly zero maintenance and silent operation) tunable performance w/ data logging allow for upgrades up to 6kw! 1 hour average run time (top speed and range will vary with rider weight but we expect 10mph ~15mph ts and 5 ~ 6 mile range per charge) suggested 220lbs ~ 6' 2" max rider for standard length board.‚ simple trigger throttle control and intuitive lean steering‚ ‚ the eco package you will receive everything listed in the standard package above as well as our revolutionary roof rack charging system!

(us shipping included) (travel not included) safety it goes without saying that safety is a must when operating your board. life jackets must be worn at all times while riding. the vest not only serves as a comfy chest pad but can save your life! kymera is a very capable craft but it should only be operated under conditions suitable for swimming and should always be operated "near shore" away from boat traffic and swimmers. before operation you should check all local regulations and follow all‚ harbors and navigation codes. kymera should never be operated by young riders without proper supervision. the technology only in the last few years has the technology come along to make kymera possible.‚ kymera utilizes the latest in super efficient brushless motor technology. capable of over 6kw of total power, your board will continue to gain performance as new batteries become available. not only does a brushless power plant produce huge power and torque, but the simple design makes it nearly zero maintenance. for marine use, a full fresh water hose down and occasional bearing lubrication are all that is required.‚ the one of a kind axial flow impeller drive system has been painstakingly tuned to perfectly match the power profile of the board. built from the ground up, it provides punchy thrust without an exposed propeller while maintaining the utmost efficiency.‚ the hull not only provides flotation and planing surface but, several other functions. the "hour glass" shape makes it easy to carry under your arm, cutting the bulk right where you need it. just as "parabolic" skis have revolutionized downhill skiing, kymera's new hull greatly improves handling without need of any mechanical steering.‚ ride quality is also key, and once again the revolutionary hull design comes into play. in your car, the ride is controlled by regulating the displacement of fluid in the shocks. kymera accomplishes this same effect with progressive wave displacement. by displacing water outward in a controlled fashion and reducing the surface area in key locations it stretches each wave out over a longer period of time and greatly smooths out the ride.‚ real control and flexibility over your power is also critical. not only will you have programmable control over total available power (programmable curves, motor timing, etc), also real data logging! you will be able to plug in and download your exact telemetry from your on-board controller. a few of the logging options include voltage, current draw, temperature, and rpm. as with all electric vehicles it is all about the battery. we have elected to get you started with our custom built 1000wh lithium polymer pack. with its small size, light weight, and monstrous current capacity it is a solid performer. ‚ the board controller will monitor your pack eliminating the need for a full (expensive) battery management system. we will provide an internal cell monitor to allow you to keep a close eye on cell balance since a full balanced charging system will maximize your battery life (300~400 cycles average). the packs can be charged onboard and can be easily swapped to extend run-time. we hope to offer the non proprietary waterproof battery case in the future to allow you to construct your own custom packs with chemistry of your choice.‚ it's go time! they say if you build a better mouse trap the world will beat a path to your door. time to find out if kymera has what it takes to capture the hearts and minds of people and forever change the way we spend time on the water. stretch goals spread the word! if kymera wins so will you! should we exceed our goal, we want to make sure to thank our supporters however possible! we put together a few extra incentives as an added bonus to our supporters! $500,000 or more, we will offer (3) additional color options for all standard kymera packages. in addition to the standard orange, we will add red, blue, and green!‚ $750,000 or more, we will add a dry storage compartment to your board with enough room for your wallet, keys phone and maybe even a sham-wow!

 dear potential backer - it's clear to us that many potential backers don't fully understand what taper is or why you might need it. meanwhile, when presented with services that will "filter" important email into a new inbox and move "unimportant" to another inbox, you "get it," you understand those. that's cool. we understand. taper is, unfortunately, something you need to use to understand, which is impossible on kickstarter. ‚ so let us try our best to explain the benefit of taper instead of what it does. the reason that other services, such as google or sanebox, move important email to a new folder is so you can focus ‚ on what is important. ‚ this is great and we like that, however, it's very difficult to focus when you have 20, 50 or 100 things to focus on. taper fixes this problem . ‚ taper lets you focus on email without distraction, allowing you the freedom to quickly and easily deal with a task. ‚ if you treat your inbox like a todo list, no problem, just flag or star the "todo" or "waiting for a response" email and taper will let in the next one. you see, taper is not ‚ about blocking email. ‚ in fact it doesn't. ‚ taper is designed to support how you already do email so you can do it faster with less distraction. ‚ if you can handle more than five tasks a time, no problem, taper can let in 7, or 10, or 15. ‚ it's up to you. without taper you have no control. ‚ we had no control. ‚ even with a "system" for managing email we often lost focus as the email kept coming. ‚ with taper we have the ability to focus on our terms. we hope this clears things up. best, p.s.‚ if you're a "single inbox" person who never uses folders, then you don't honestly need taper but thanks for checking us out. p.s.s. if you still want to read more, it's all below. ‚ if not, please back us so you can experience taper also. our goal is to take you... ...in about 23 seconds, without having to download or learn a single thing. taper is a doorman for your inbox. since, well, basically the creation of email, our inboxes have had way too many emails in them. look at yours right now - do you have more than ten sitting there? twenty? fifty? more?! that's called email overload. it's when you have more emails in your inbox then you can efficiently manage or deal with. email overload sucks up 30% of our day (according to the la times and others ), makes us more stressed, less productive and costs businesses a crazy amount in lost productivity. ‚ so we said, "well, if email overload means you have too much to deal with, wouldn't the solution be to, umm, have less?" ‚ guess what, it is! we looked around, and found some really useful tools that we just didn't want to duplicate: spam filters - for spam categorized inboxes - for social, news and promo email‚ auto-unsubscribe - tools to remove yourself from newsletter snooze buttons - ‚ to deal with email later apps to turn your email into a todo list but, there was still nothing to simply control the flow, which, let's face it, can be intense. so, we set out to add that simple feature to email - something to slow down the number of emails we deal with at any one time. you're concerned, i can tell 1. i'll miss an email from my boss and be fired. ‚ you can set your boss as a vip and he'll skip the line directly to your inbox. ‚ you will not be fired. 2. ok so i delete 5, another 5 come in. ‚ i delete those, another 5! ‚ how is that not stressful? ‚ you have the option of setting the frequency of incoming mail from immediately upon move/delete, to every 30 minutes. ‚ soon you will learn that not every email demands an immediate response, and 30 uninterrupted minutes can be a very precious thing indeed. 3. i'm too anxious to have emails waiting that i don't know about - i need to see all my email... taper doesn't withhold your email from you - you can peek in on it at any time in the taperqueue folder. ‚ if you have many emails in your queue, we'll even send you a notification listing them in a single email. don't fear the unknown, for it is not unknown - it is known. we knew this solution would have to run in the cloud so that it was always working, but that would cost a bit of money for hosting, data transfer, ip addresses, etc. so, we created a little mac app as a proof-of-concept that we called taper, which is now a patent-pending invention. it works like an invisible doorman to your inbox. instead of letting every email you ever receive go directly to your inbox, taper lets in five. once you delete, archive, move or flag an email, another is allowed in. the rest of your emails are stored securely in a folder in your email account‚ j ust in case you‚ really needed to see something before taper lets it in. so why only five emails? you know how easy it is to deal with five emails at a time? really darn easy! and, when you have so few emails at a time to deal with, you really miss nothing, work faster and simply don't worry about getting behind. yes we're serious. it works and it's that darn simple. no emails are ever filtered out; you'll eventually see everything, but in a calm, zen-like way, instead of having a crap load of email constantly dumped on you. do i really need this? look again at your inbox, right now. stress you out a bit? then yeah, you need it. because every email that comes in after this point, right now, adds to that stress, decreases productivity and wastes your time. already have an "email" system? good job! then you recognize how important a managed inbox is. taper helps to reinforce the most recommended email habits of quickly and decisively processing email, deleting what's unimportant and moving on. if you have a system designed to try to help you get to inbox zero ‚ everyday, taper can help make sure it happens without messing with your system. but i'm going to miss something! ahhhhhh! see, you're stressed. but with taper, you won't be and you won't miss anything. here's why: if you end up with emails in your queue, taper will send you a single summary email so you can see what's there at a glance. also, your queue folder is always there, so you can easily jump to it if you need to (which rarely happens once you start using taper cause you just do email better). taper also has a neat little feature called the vip list. anyone on your vip list will immediate move to the front of the line ‚ in your queue, ensuring that they will be the very next emails taper lets through. so, any emails from the boss, girlfriends, boyfriends, judge, etc. will never be missed and your inbox will still stay neat and organized. to use, do nothing different! taper just works, silently, in the background, communicating with your email server to block email and move it when ready. use gmail, yahoo, outlook, apple mail, your iphone or whateva. don't matter. it's like a diaphragm you didn't know was there (that let's in a baby or two every once in a while). but you'll learn a ton with taper, you simply learn how to manage email better. true, you don't have to "learn" anything new to use taper or use any fancy new software, but by using taper, you will find that your email habits improve. emails do not sit in your inbox. you either file or delete or taper no give you new one. it's better email management pavlovian dog style (yes, you're the dog). ok, but why kickstarter? why now? we built the proof-of-concept as a mac osx app that runs silently in the background just to see if our theory was right. we shared it with a handful of friends and relatives and so far no one has gone back. ‚ but there's a problem. right now, it only runs on a mac and only when that mac is running. we want to turn taper into a cloud-based solution that‚ anyone can sign up for to end email overload. once someone signs up, they're done. they change nothing. do nothing new. use any email device or client they want and taper will still fix their email overload problem. we have the plans, the technology and six months worth of experience on how to tame this beast called email, but we need your help. we need funds to help cover storage and bandwidth costs to develop taper as a cloud-based solution. ‚ what do i get? we've come up with some cool rewards based on your specific needs, but in a nutshell, there will be taper for personal use and taper pro for business use: we also have some cool, fun stuff like awesome buddha stickers and beautiful music so zen-like, you will swear you are emailing to the buddha himself. requirements for taper for the mac osx version, you simply need an intel-based mac and‚ os x lion 10.7 or later. for the web-based version, you'll need an imap, google apps or exchange server email account (which covers almost everyone in case you don't know what ya got, but please check first if you don't). works with... anything! as for reading email, taper has no requirements. what to use;‚ gmail.com , apple mail, outlook or even lynx? fine. iphone, android, blackberry, blueberry? okie doke. taper don't care. questions, doubts, concerns? ‚ almost everyone we've told about taper, before they try it, says the same thing: " this won't work for me, i have too many emails, i have a system, i'll miss emails from my boss, wife, lover, bail bondsman, etc." and our answer is always the same - we have no answer. trying to explain why dealing with emails in groups of five is so much faster and more productive than having an inbox full of emails is like trying to explain why having to fold only five shirts is better than a hamper full of laundry - it just is! and then we say this, "try it." try it for one week and tell us what you think. and now they send us cookies, and sometimes cakes 'cause they have more time to do baking, we guess. but seriously, we will happily answer any question or thoughts or concerns you have. just ask. and obviously, namaste (whatever that means). 
 ‚ here's what people around the world are saying about us "[the] possibilities seem endless." tom spendlove, designer edge "verve lets you play games like you never have before." vegard ottervig, teknofil "[the] interface makes customization the absolute easiest thing ever!" grant lahaie, epicpodquest "the verve has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with our computers." justin arnott, slimgamer "hackers, makers, tinkerers (is that a word?), programmers, and general noodlers should check out the verve kickstarter project." julie strietelmeier, the gadgeteer "verve's strength is that you do not need engineering skills to use it." manuel dorn, korben "programming the sensors ... is as simple as a couple clicks of your mouse." colin druce-mcfadden, dvice "it is an entry point for people who have no technical or coding skills." samantha cook, geek mom what is the verve? the verve is a product that lets you connect the world around you to a computer using almost any type of sensor. when plugged in to a computer, the verve behaves like a standard keyboard and mouse. plug in any sensor (light, force, motion), and suddenly you're controlling the computer by squeezing, waving, pressing, dancing... you get the idea? you have complete control over how to interpret the sensor information and convert it into meaningful keystrokes or mouse actions to control your favorite application or video game. everything is easy to use and no coding is required. the standard verve kit comes with a verve unit, seven useful sensors (adventurous users can make their own--we'll show you how), two banana clips for the touch sensor, seven cables to connect the sensors to the verve unit, 5 extension blocks, and a usb cable to connect to your computer. the verve unit comes with an app that makes it easy to configure the sensors, as well as a ‚Äúquick start‚Äù guide that contains step by step examples on how to use the system. once you configure the sensors for your application, *no software is needed*. the verve will work with any device or software that accepts keyboard and mouse, including macs, pc, linux, raspberry pi, etc. furthermore, the sensors settings are stored as a human readable text file to share with friends.‚ beginners can control any game or app (including web pages); techie's are free to write their own apps. our goal is to have you playing with sensors and controlling your computer within minutes after opening the kit. anyone can use the verve. below, one of our first inventors shares her project with you. you'll need an

controller‚Äù application. it‚Äôs called velostat and it enables you to make some really cool touch pads. simply cut the velostat into any shape and size and connect it to the touch sensor via alligator clip. below is a short video for the inner musician in all of us. for this application we used a touch sensor connected to velostat, a light sensor, and a motion sensor (to detect jumping).

who is it for? the verve is four things in one. first, it is a recreational gadget that allows you to have lots of fun playing with your computer in new ways. second, it is a diy (do-it-yourself) kit for students and inventors to prototype or build new technical solutions to problems. third, it is an educational product for budding engineers and scientists to learn about science, sensors, controls, computers, and technology. finally, it is a new kind of creative medium. this kind of ‚Äúphysical computing‚Äù device empowers artists and creators of all kinds to explore new ways to delight and share our humanity in ways beyond traditional forms of artistry. we can‚Äôt wait to see what you‚Äôll do with it! fun‚ since when did it make sense to control a video game with a mouse? why not play a baseball game with a baseball bat? with verve it‚Äôs easy. attach a sensor to your favorite sports toy and use verve to translate your activity into game controls. with verve, people come up with all kinds of amazing ways to play their games: jumping, swinging, slapping, and even touching hands. practical the verve lets you try out ideas quickly and prototype new systems. verve can be as serious as you want. the same easy-to-use interface allows you precision control of the sensitivity of your sensors and up to 10 actions per sensor channel. in minutes, you can set up a system that tracks your movements, detects a burglar, or even monitors a factory. almost any kind of sensor works with verve, so there‚Äôs no reason not to think big. educational the verve dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for learning about physical computing systems. even elementary school children can use sensors, control computers, design technology, and measure the world without the need for a degree in electrical engineering. the verve experience builds intuition about sensors and computing systems, and generates excitement about technology from the start. an educational pack, prepared by award winning educators and scientists, is available for teachers, complete with lesson plans and projects designed to teach children about science and technology in a way that is natural and fun. creative many artists are discovering that technology is the new medium for creative expression. but getting to use that medium has traditionally required the artist to face formidable technical obstacles. the verve changes that. with the verve, artists can produce incredible multimedia experiences that connect with people through touch, movement, sound, and interaction‚Äîall without having to write code or configure computers. meet the sensors all of our sensors are designed to be easy to use, right out of the box. plug in a cable (provided) and the sensor is ready to go. we‚Äôve picked the most useful and fun sensors for you. but we‚Äôre adding more all the time, so you should be able to find a sensor to fit your needs. how does it work? first,‚ plug your verve into your favorite computer‚Äôs usb slot, then pick a sensor and plug it to one of the seven sensor slots on the verve. the verve kit comes with seven useful sensors ready to go and you can order more‚ from our website.‚ second , open the up verve application and see how each sensor responds in real-time. this comes preinstalled on the verve device. ‚ third, choose what you want your sensor to do. you can make each sensor look like any keyboard or mouse action. simply move the bars on each sensor channel to set a threshold. then click on the area above or below the threshold bar to choose your keyboard or mouse event. and that‚Äôs it! ......but i want more power!‚ alright, you got it. simply click on the individual sensor tab and you‚Äôll find more advanced mappings options. here you can increase the sensitivity of each sensor, assign up to 10 keyboard/mouse commands, and tell the computer how fast/slow you want each action to happen. why kickstarter? we think kickstarter is the ideal place to launch this product. kickstarters are our kind of people--forward looking, tech savvy, doers who aren‚Äôt content to wait around for things to happen by themselves. verve is an idea whose time has come. we need kickstarters to help us get our product into production, thereby enabling a generation of technical and creative people to make awesome technology and creative projects. if we hit our funding target then we can afford to build the devices at costs low enough to be affordable enough to put these devices in the hands of anyone who wants one ‚Äì and in time for the holidays! our story the verve project started at the university of california irvine as a research project in exergaming systems for health applications. under the guidance of professor mark bachman, then-uci students nizan friedman and jordan linford developed sensors and games for exercise bicycles, treadmills, ellipticals, and other equipment. however, the in-house games just didn‚Äôt seem to match the quality and fun of commercially available games, and the team felt disappointed in the results of their effort. eventually, the team moved its attention to using commercial and open-source games with beautiful graphics and immersive gameplay. to accomplish this, at first the team simply hacked a game controller (which worked great). however, it quickly became evident that a dedicated electronic unit that could map sensor inputs to game controls was a far better solution. the team spent many months developing the first prototype on a breadboard. over the course of 18 months, the team improved the design, started getting printed circuits made professionally, and made the system capable of saving configuration files on an sd card, so that sensor settings could be saved. the unit was a great success--any kind of exergame could be created to match any kind of gameplay. these units are now used in several exergaming projects at uci and other institutions. after nizan and jordan graduated, the team felt that it would be a great idea to convert this project into a commercial product that could be made affordable and easy to use. with this in mind, the team developed the verve, a device that can be mass manufactured, has internal storage, can fit in an enclosure, and accepts seven standard 3.5 mm jacks for sensor input. in addition, the team developed pre-calibrated, plug-and-play sensors designed to be easy to use with the verve unit. the team also developed a beta version of a user interface software that makes mapping from sensor inputs to computer controls a breeze. with these changes to the initial designs intended for research, the team feels that it has made the project accessible and affordable for everyone to use. the project cannot continue without funding. the team still has to complete software development for a bulletproof user experience, get professional enclosures produced, manufacture the units in large quantities, and package everything together. however, the project is mature enough that most of the headaches usually associated with developing a new project are taken care of. production and fulfillment plan: we want to be perfectly transparent with you every step of the way. here‚Äôs some information on how we will be turning this product from an idea to a product that you can hold in your hands. production and fulfillment will be handled in a three step process. step 1: ‚ manufacturing: ‚ printed circuit board (pcb) fabrication, pcb population, enclosure manufacturing, and packaging will all be handled through noa labs. this manufacturing firm has a proven track record. they have worked with giants such as bmw and airbus as well as countless small businesses and start-ups. to personally vet the company, we purchased an initial sample run of printed circuit boards and enclosures (shown in verve v4 picture). the company is ready to produce up to 50,000 units per month and quoted us a lead time of 10-12 days for production. shipment will take another 3-5 days. in parallel, we will order the colorful sensor cables, the cable extenders, and the mini-usb cables from a trusted electronics supplier. we received initial sample units of all these components from this supplier and they too are ready to ship at a moment‚Äôs notice. their quoted lead time is 5-7 days with another 3-5 days for shipment. the second you help us hit our funding goal we will begin this process. step 2 :‚ assembly. ‚ we will begin assembly the same day the units arrive from both noa labs and our electronics supplier. we will program the microcontrollers, add the verve software to the flash memory located on the pcb, and test each sensor, board, and cable to make sure that everything works perfectly. we then package this item in the supplied retail box. we already have 10 people signed up to help us out with this step. this process is expected to take between 3-5 days depending on the number of orders. step 3 :‚ fulfillment. ‚ we partnered with a local fulfillment center that is ready to ship out all the units. this process will take 1-2 days. it will take an additional 3-5 days for ups to get the item to your door. we will push as hard as humanly possible to get this item to you before december 21st. if we hit our funding goal before the end of the kickstarter campaign, this will greatly improve the chances of us reaching this deadline. ‚ who you're funding the inxus interactive team consists of mark bachman (left), nizan friedman (middle), and jordan linford (right).

 as scientists, we are constantly expanding the frontiers of research and knowledge. yet, we are also constantly re-discovering knowledge that others have not had the time to publish and improving existing methods without the ability to share the improvements with the world. the mission of‚ zappylab ‚ is to change this with the‚ protocols.io ‚ repository. imagine you spend 3 months instead of a week to do a simple dna transformation in a new species. after much frustration and many cups of coffee later, you discover that you need to do it at room temperature instead of the 42-degree water bath. this is a tiny but critical detail in a common technique.‚ unfortunately, there is no effective way to let others working with this species know about your discovery. we started zappylab to create a free, central,‚ up-to-date , crowdsourced protocol repository. we just launched the beta version of‚ protocols.io . this is where you will be able to share and discover changes, corrections, and optimizations of published methods. the trick is to make the sharing easy and crowdsourced. that's why we have built a protocol checklist app, inside our mobile bench tools suite on ios and android . we are raising the funds to enable the sharing of protocol modifications from the mobile app with a tap of a button, and to implement the visualization of the edits on‚ protocols.io . so if you discover the need for room temperature instead of 42 degrees, you can tap "share" on your phone and this change instantly appears on‚ protocols.io ‚ and is automatically broadcasted to everyone who is using this protocol. and do keep in mind that we are just getting started. we are bursting with useful features that we want to include in bench tools (text-to-speech timer that announces "pcr timer completed" instead of buzzing, ability to troubleshoot your protocol by connecting to other researchers using it in the same species, and many, many others). our protocol checklist will soon be on google glass and we are actively exploring hands-free devices and controls so that in the future, you will be able to use bench tools while pipetting in your gloves. so please, take a look at bench tools . play with our personalized literature recommendations service‚ pubchase . and just imagine what we can do with your support! production plan. april 2014 - make published protocols editable on your mobile device or protocols.io may 2014 - "share" button to submit the changes. and interface to visualize all comments/changes on step-level at protocols.io. june 2014 - ability to connect for trouble-shooting to other scientists who are using a given protocol.

 pollen propulsion project: the sky's no longer the limit on earth, pollen is sometimes transported by wind.‚ in space, the propulsion provided by a fan should have the same effect on the pollen. we hypothesize that the force of moving gases will cause corn pollen to cross the micro-lab from point a to point b in a micro-gravity environment. we will use a fan to propel corn pollen from one point of a‚ micro-lab‚ to another‚ in‚ micro-gravity‚ to demonstrate that pollination of corn is possible in this‚ environment. the findings from this experiment could be helpful in developing a "space farming" program, where crops are grown in micro-gravity. if said "space farming" program were to occur, many potential benefits could be reaped, such as the increased productivity of essential resources for extraterrestrial colonies. also, as students, this project gives us the chance to learn about and solve challenging problems related to making devices capable of working in microgravity environments. some other things we can learn from this experiment are coding advanced programs, mechanical design, soldering, circuitry, and many other useful skills. point b ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ ‚ point a ‚ our final flight unit integration test date: the week of february 24 - march 1, 2014.

 what is it? ‚ combox live is a website that allows users to commentate on any live sports event, and broadcast the audio live to the world. for aspiring commentators - a website that allows you to find an audience, and for sports fans - a website offering a multitude of different commentary options across multiple sporting fixtures. sick of the same old sports commentary? combox live will open up a world of possibilities, including:‚ categorised feeds ranging from comedy to professional, from english to chinese.‚ live chat with those commentating, and other sports fans in the channel.‚ total control - switch between a plethora of different sports and commentators. honest commentary as commentators can say what they want without having to worry about officials who control their access.‚ why does the world need this?‚ consumers are now accustomed to having unlimited choice when it comes to entertainment, however traditional sports commentary has quickly become tired. if you don‚Äôt like the tv commentators that are chosen for you, you have very little choice but to simply accept them. in an age where i can listen to any song at anytime, why should live sports commentary be so restrictive? combox live‚Äôs ultimate goal is to bring more choice to sports fans by revolutionising the live commentary experience.‚ so how does it work? webrtc now enables browser based real-time communication so users can record and distribute audio content directly from their browser with one click. simply put - you can watch the game on tv, mute the volume, and broadcast your commentary live via comboxlive.com to the world. commentate by yourself, or connect with a friend anywhere in the world to call the game of your choice. users will consume this audio commentary in one of two ways:‚ mute their tv and listen to alternative commentary on combox live whilst watching the broadcast images, or;‚ listen to combox live as a standalone audio service, much like you would listen to sports commentary on the radio.‚ who will commentate on the site? of course anyone can, provided they have a microphone and an internet connection! that‚Äôs the beauty of the concept. but two key segments will be targeted initially:‚ sports enthusiasts - we all know someone who fancies themselves as a better option that the existing commentators. they are a bit of a know-it-all but are probably just as knowledgeable and entertaining as those on tv.‚ celebrities - there are actors, musicians, comedians etc that are passionate about sports and who people know and trust will entertain them.‚ where is combox live development at? this is an idea i have already been developing for a few years and thus far i have the site wire-framed, the web streaming technology built (and tested), logos and style guide done, and most pages designed. i am using kickstarter to help me get the actual site built, and to launch it to the world. so join me in revolutionising the live sports industry and hit pledge now! 
 thank you to all of our backers for making the glowing plant kickstarter campaign the success that it was. we are deeply appreciative of the trust and support you have shown us. you helped us put synthetic biology on the crowdfunding map, now it‚Äôs up to us to create and deliver the glowing plant . you can keep following us through our official blog , with regular updates and discussion on our facebook and twitter ‚ pages. missed the kickstarter campaign ? you can still support the project with donations at our store , where some of the rewards remain available.‚ we will update this store with other items like the open-source dna parts we are synthesizing when they become available in late 2013. donations at this store will count towards our stretch goals until the end of june. as seen on: testimonials what we are offering: all backers from the usa who back the project with $40‚ or more will receive seeds to grow a glowing plant at home. ‚ once we have the plant, it is just a matter of breeding enough offspring to grow seeds for all backers. you can expect around 50-100 small seeds in the packet.‚ ***update - we met our stretch goal. if you back the project at the $150 we will ship you a glowing rose as well when it's completed. ‚ delivery will be 6-12 months after the delivery of the glowing plant*** for those outside the usa we are waiving additional international shipping charges to compensate for not being able to send you the seeds. ‚ if you get the book and write to us after the project we will also send you a vial of the dna that way if it's legal in your country (your responsibility to check) and you can source the other‚ ingredients (eg agrobacterium) you can follow the instructions in the book and make your own plant. * see risks and challenges section regarding release of seeds.‚ the team making this happen help‚ spread the word about the glowing plant project:‚ ‚∑follow us on twitter ( http://twitter.com/glowingplant )‚ ‚∑like us on facebook ( http://facebook.com/glowingplant )‚ ‚∑email your friends our blog ( http://www.glowingplant.com )‚ ‚∑tweet about the project - click here for a sample tweet !‚ please back the project and tell everyone know to help spread the word! thank you for your support - we hope you'll join us in making this project successful!‚ additional information: what is synthetic biology?‚ all living organisms contain an instruction set that determines what they look like and what they do. these instructions are encoded in the organisms‚Äôs dna ‚Äî long and complex strings of molecules embedded in every living cell. this is an organism‚Äôs genetic code (or ‚Äúgenome‚Äù). humans have been altering the genetic code of plants and animals for millennia, by selectively breeding individuals with desirable features. as biotechnologists have learned more about how to read and manipulate this code, they have begun to take genetic information associated with useful features from one organism, and add it into another one. this is the basis of genetic engineering, and has allowed researchers to speed up the process of developing new breeds of plants and animals. more recently we have learnt how to make new sequences of dna from scratch. by combining these techniques with the principles of modern engineering, scientists can now use computers and laboratory chemicals to design organisms that do new things. this is the essence of synthetic biology and it‚Äôs potential is tremendous ‚Äì we can use it to produce cheaper, more efficient biofuels, to excrete the precursors of medical drugs or create new plants which naturally glow. why do we need your help? we‚Äôve already invested our own time and money into the project developing the dna designs, finding partners to help execute and investigating the legal ramifications but don‚Äôt have the financial resources to print the dna and complete the transformations ourselves.‚ by backing this project you can help create the world‚Äôs first naturally‚ glowing plant ‚ available to the public. inspire others to become interested in synthetic biology and receive some awesome rewards in the process.‚ what will you use the funds for? we are using synthetic biology techniques and genome compiler‚Äôs software to insert bioluminescence genes into arabidopsis, a small flowering plant and member of the mustard family, to make a plant that visibly glows in the dark (it is inedible). funds raised will be used to print the dna sequences we have designed using‚ genome compiler ‚ and to transform the plants by inserting these sequences into the plant and then growing the resultant plant in the lab.‚ printing dna costs a minimum of 25 cents per base pair and our sequences are about 10,000 base pairs long. we plan to print a number of sequences so that we can test the results of trying different promoters ‚Äì this will allow us to optimize the result. we will be printing our dna with cambrian genomics who have developed a revolutionary laser printing system that massively reduces the cost of dna synthesis. transforming the plant will initially be done using the agrobacterium method. ‚ our printed dna will be inserted into a special type of bacteria which can insert its dna into the plant. ‚ flowers of the plant are then dipped into a solution containing the transformed bacteria. the bacteria injects our dna into the cell nucleus of the flowers which pass it onto their seeds which we can grow until they glow! ‚ you can see this process in action in our video. once we have proven the designs work we will then insert the same gene sequence into the plant using a gene gun. ‚ this is more complicated, as there's a risk the gene sequence gets scrambled, but the result will be unregulated by the usda and thus suitable for release. funds raised will also be used to support our work to develop an open policy framework for diy bio work involving recombinant dna. ‚ this framework will provide guidelines to help others ‚ who are inspired by this project navigate the regulatory and social challenges inherent in community based synthetic biology. ‚ the framework will include recommendations for what kinds of projects are safe for diy bio‚ enthusiasts and‚ recommendations for the processes which should be put in place (such as getting experts to review the plans). why now? recent advances in the field of synthetic biology, such as‚ genome compiler ‚Äôs software and cambrian genomics dna printing hardware, have brought the cost and complexity of genetically engineering new organisms within reach of amateurs: as the chart shows, the costs continue to fall, and within a few years thousands of diy bio enthusiasts will be using citizen science to inspire their own creations. we want to create a signature project which inspires them and demonstrates to the world what‚Äôs already possible with a little creativity and imagination.‚ is this legal? yes it is!‚ there are three federal agencies which regulate genetically modified organisms in the us, each with a different remit for public safety: usda regulates plant and agriculture impact through aphis and are the most relevant for our project. we've been in touch with them to understand and address their main concerns which are mainly related to the introduction of potential plant pests.‚ after more than 15 years working with genetically engineered crops they have established a set of guidelines for what needs additional testing, and what doesn't.‚ so long as we meet all their requirements we can safely release the plant. one of their inputs was that we should use the gene-gun technique to transform our plants, instead of agrobacterium. epa regulates new uses of pesticides - many gmo's introduce pesticide or herbicide resistance to their plants (either as a selection agent or as an intended outcome).‚ we have elected not to do this, as we can use the glowing effect as a marker, so will not need to go through their testing procedures. fda regulates food and feedstock implications and requires extensive testing to make sure the product is safe if this is the case.‚ because our plant is strictly ornamental and not for consumption by animals or humans we do not have to go through this testing. we will continue to liaise with the federal agencies, especially aphis, as the project develops to ensure we are compliant with the frameworks they have put in place to protect the public. regrettably the european union has tighter restrictions in place so we can‚Äôt send seeds there as a reward. is this safe? the head of genetics at harvard medical school, george church, who works extensively on engineering biosafety described our project as 'as safe as it gets'.‚ we are introducing non-pathogenic, non-toxic, well‚ categorized‚ genes to a model plant which is well understood by biologists and which will not survive very well in the environment. ‚ in the lab we will comply with all nih guidelines on recombinant dna research. ‚ our work is graded at biosafety level 1, which is the lowest level of risk. what is genome compiler? genome compiler is software, designed by omri and his team, which allows a user to easily design genetic sequences and order them online. ‚ the software includes a large database of genetic parts and a beautiful interface so you can easily combine them to create your desired results. what is cambrian genomics? at cambrian genomics austen and his team make the first commercial hardware/systems for laser printing dna. presently, researchers in academia and industry order or clone &gt;$1b/year of dna. cambrian plans to deliver high quality sequence verified dna to buyers in this existing/growing worldwide market. what is project cyborg? currently being developed by the bio/nano/programmable group at autodesk research, project cyborg is a cloud-based meta-platform of design tools for programming matter across domains and scales. project cyborg provides elastic cloud-based computation in a web-based cad shell for services such as modeling, simulation and multi-objective design optimization. project cyborg allows individuals or groups to create specialized design platforms specific for their domains, whatever their domains happen to be, from nanoparticle design to tissue engineering, to human-scale self-assembling manufacturing. who made your video?

hybrid case and two device cards: gobattery and gosolar. these‚ two device cards are just the beginning. bonus rewards: unlocked as we reach the following "stacked goals" how gostacked works: the unique, patent-pending design of the hybrid case allows you to switch the gostacked device cards to suit your lifestyle.‚ the device cards are an intelligent, efficient, and adaptive energy management system designed to optimize the run time of your iphone, resulting in more power than other battery cases on the market today. the sky is the limit with how many and which type of device card will be next. the gostacked system provides a comfortable, ergonomic design with the complete protection of a dual-injected hard shell case with a shockproof outer coating. engineered with edge-to-edge protection and outfitted with unlimited battery life to keep your iphone safe and charged, allowing you to truly do more. its elegant, thin design makes it the perfect accessory, easily fitting into any small place.‚ the enhanced forward-ported acoustics redirects the iphone audio towards you, optimizing playback and maximizing your music experience.‚ don't give up any iphone features or functionality. plug in the hybrid smart case and charge both your iphone and the attached device card simultaneously. gostacked gives you the option to‚ purchase‚ a case that uses the 30 pin charger or a micro usb charger. the stacked dock will charge your iphone while it is in the hybrid case, and it will also charge two additional device cards that are docked behind it. gostacked device cards when it comes to battery life, gostacked has your back. its ingenious "no tools needed" attachment system is patent-pending. in other words, we built it from the ground up with you in mind. its design is simultaneously beautiful, simple, and so easy to install that it makes everything else look primitive.‚ device cards enable an added feature and function that the iphone does not currently have. we want to start off with two of the most desirable features that every smartphone‚ user wants: more power with the gobattery device card and ‚Äúgoing green‚Äù with the gosolar device card. when you know you will be away from a power outlet all day, you can stack on the gosolar device card and your hybrid‚ case will charge in either‚ solar or ambient light. gosolar is all about freedom. the solar cell is made from‚ impact-resistant and scratch-resistant‚ polymers, to protect it from life's‚ little accidentals.‚ the key to the success of this technology is the unique solar panel. it has several separate layers of amorphous silicon, each tuned to a different frequency of light. if your iphone is dead, it‚Äôs not a problem‚ with the auto-on power up feature. when you stack a powered device card onto the hybrid case it will start charging your dead iphone to get you back in the game of life. each device card will communicate via bluetooth 4.0 and the bluetooth low energy protocol chip that is integrated into each card. gostacked device cards will have a color around the outer rim that‚ represents‚ how it is used. red is for power and green is for solar.‚ whichever card you choose, you can rest assured‚ you will have enough power to do all of your tasks with some to spare. future-proof your iphone the days of‚ carrying‚ a charging box with extra cords around with you are over. this unique ability to stack and add power when you need it will change your lifestyle and set the platform for future technologies to be easily incorporated after later development. there are literally an infinite‚ number of features and‚ functions‚ that can be designed to keep you stacked. the device cards‚ will be compatible with future hybrid cases, eliminating the need to purchase new charging accessories or batteries with each new iphone upgrade. companion gostacked+ app while the hardware is the most visible part of this project, the gostacked+ app is the brain that controls it all. it starts with installing your‚ iphone into the hybrid case. your iphone will check to see if you have downloaded the gostacked+ app for ios, and if not the iphone will ask you if you want to download it from the app store. through the gostacked+ app you set what percentage to automatically turn on your device card and start charging your iphone battery. you also set the percentage for when to stop utilizing the device card battery. for example: if your percentages are set to start charging at 20% and end at 99%, once your iphone battery reaches 20% the battery from the device card will recharge your iphone. then, when your iphone reaches 99% battery power, the battery power in the device card will stop being transmitted into your iphone and saved until you need it in the future. the app learns your habits and recommends how best to set your gostacked device cards for your day. "look mom, no hands!" the built-in time management feature increases your productivity by providing usage feedback. the controls give you the ability to structure a power safe environment with real-time monitoring. the gostacked+ app programs itself in approximately one week. a personalized schedule is created based on your charging habits and the app continuously adapts your schedule to your changing life. the free gostacked+ app will be available in the app store before the shipments are sent out.‚ the community when you log in with gostacked+ app, the data automatically publishes to your account.‚ here, you track trends and share data with friends and family. easily view your power usage over time and determine the most efficient way to stay charged through your account's homepage. going green ‚ should be on everyone's mind. the data collected by gostacked+ lets you easily understand your charging style and its impact on the environment, and suggests ways to improve your profile. compare your power saving style with others. are you greener than your friends? ‚ app sdk for developers we built the gostacked+ app for ios, but gostacked will play with your app as well. we're making an open source software developer kit (sdk) available to people who want to build their own ideas for gostacked integration. just think how much fun it will be when you reach a‚ level in a game it unlocks increased functionality in your device card. ‚ how about a‚ wallet‚ device card that opens with a push of a button on your iphone app? a new idea or technology can easily be designed for a gostacked device card. we did the hard work for you and we don't like to play alone. why should we have all the fun? apple manufacturing license (mfi) why kickstarter we like to think of gostacked as a platform, not an accessory.‚ kickstarter is a great way for us to accelerate your gostacked system.‚ sharing our vision with the kickstarter community is something we envisioned from the start, from pre-orders to feedback, while celebrating our success with our future customers. even though this is our design, it is your product and we want it to be right the first time.‚ in the next couple of months, we will be turning our 3d prototype into reality. here are some areas where your pledges will help accelerate gostacked: sensors, batteries and pcb's ‚ - the components that make up the hardware of gostacked. injection tooling and molds ‚ - to manufacture the housing of gostacked and the device cards. manufacturing and assembly ‚ - we are very picky with how gostacked looks and feels, so the actual production is a highly specialized series of steps that need to be‚ finalized. research and development ‚ - we are highly‚ motivated‚ to not only kick-start you with these 2 device cards, but future cards as well. gostacked+ app and sdk ‚ - from cleaning up the ui and adding extra features, this is an ongoing process. we have put in countless hours to get both the gostacked+ app and the sdk ready. shipping and packaging ‚ - we have to get your new gostacked to you, wherever you are. as you can see from the breakdown some other fixed costs of business including prototyping, tooling, and samples. the other portion is covering the variable costs of design and engineering over the past nine months, including legal fees for patents and trademarks. project status we look forward to working with the kickstarter community closely and transparently as we go from prototypes to a polished product. here at stacked labs we know that the product is ready to enter into the next stage.‚ these are prototypes you see here on our kickstarter page. they are 3d printed, and have assembled circuit boards from a local company. the goal here was to verify‚ the entire gostacked system‚ can and will work - especially the bluetooth 4.0 smart ready module, since that is the most complicated module from a ios app perspective. in may, all the feedback from the kickstarter community will be applied to the gostacked system for manufacturability, reliability, and product improvements. after that, the full-force production of the gostacked system starts to meet our deadline for you. manufacturing and production plan there are a lot of parts involved in bringing a product like this to market. we have put forth our best efforts to planning. therefore, we have designed a stacked-phased production plan, intended to expose technical and production issues early.‚ we think a 4 month delivery time is appropriate for gostacked. obviously, the sooner, the better, but we can absolutely guarantee that we will not ship something unless we are 110% confident in its design and reliability. we promise to give you updates as often as possible so you can share in the journey. what the future holds: redefining "smart case" from rushing to get children off to school to the busy day filled with meetings and basketball practice, we want to ensure you have more than enough power to take on the day. we‚ are using state-of-the-art technologies to create your gostacked system and setting a new standard for fashionable lifestyle thus redefining the term ‚Äúsmart case.‚Äù‚ protection with power is a major void in today‚Äôs smartphone market. as more and more people switch over to smartphones, the demand for power will continue to grow. we want the gostacked system to fill that void. it's not always ‚Äúwhat you see is what you get‚Äù with gostacked. as new technologies become available we will have the ability to develop new device cards for you to stack how you see fit. you are backing something more than just another case-you are backing a new lifestyle. specification: ‚ delivered and on your iphone‚ gostacked: the hybrid smart case for iphone. "how will you be stacked today?" the evolution of case design and functionality keeps getting better. you desire to have the latest case technology but must constantly switch cases to achieve this desire. what if you really like your current iphone case? this is the issue that inspired us to design gostacked. with gostacked, you can integrate new technologies right into your hybrid smart case. to us it only made sense to create a hybrid smart case that would be able to grow with technology, while extending the functionality of your iphone as well as protecting it. with‚ your support, we will have your gostacked for iphone 4/4s and iphone 5 to every backer by mid-august. we hope that you are inspired and excited by the idea and choose to support the project. either way, message us with any questions and please spread the word with your friends and family. ----- we would like to give ben and the team at bx films a big thanks for all the hard work they put into the making of our gostacked video. ----- trademark disclaimer: gostacked(tm) and its logo are trademarks of stacked labs, inc.‚ apple, the apple logo and iphone, ipad, imac are trademarks of apple inc., registered in the‚ u.s. and other countries. app store is a service mark of apple inc. bluetooth‚Æ word mark is registered trademark owned by bluetooth sig, inc. other trademarks are those of their respective owners. 
 basics since leaving the apron strings of a goliath chemical corporation 10 years ago, my team and i have built up a portfolio of world-changing green technologies.‚ we've done contract work for oak ridge national labs, the natick army research center for flame retardant uniforms, and are working on alternative renewable sources of energy, materials, and plastics. two years ago an investor group buying up distressed biodiesel plants recruited us to set up an r&amp;d and analytical lab to support their effort. we happily spent that time building up our analytical capabilities, sorting out procedures, working towards accreditation, and trying to teach their production folks the basics of quality management. we also made a number of inventions along the way, and did a lot to support their business, so we were shocked when they told us they weren't going to pay us for any of the ongoing research after all ‚Äì then were shocked again when they told us they were pulling the plug on the lab and wanted all their shiny new stuff back by the end of the year. ‚ we are left with a lot of capabilities, but not a complete set of analytical instruments for biodiesel. we can't support ourselves as an analytical testing lab now, so it's time to bite the bullet and commercialize something. about our green technologies since founding missing octave insights, inc., we have developed flame retardant fabrics based on baking-soda-and-vinegar "volcano" reactions (patented) instead of toxic ingredients, made fire barriers out of recycled carpet and newspaper, found a way to make valuable plastics out of the hundreds of billions of pounds of paper mill waste that is burned to make greenhouse gases in the us annually (working on patenting this), and have conceived new approaches to algae farms for production of bio-based alternatives to petroleum (need to get started protecting these ideas). if you want see videos of our burn tests, check out myspace.com/missingoctave/videos . you can also see our websites at www.missingoctave.com and www.moilabs.com -- sorry, we've not put the attention into keeping it updated that we should ‚Äì too busy. our pet project - lignin paper mills burn about 350 billion pounds of lignin (the left over cell walls from the wood, which does not go into paper). ‚ they claim they're generating energy but really it's too wet to be anything but a legal waste-disposal method. ‚ what they're generating is greenhouse gases. we have better ideas what to do with it. people have had limited success mixing lignin into things like asphalt, epoxy thermosets, and plastics as fillers. ‚ we are the first to convert this lignin into a reworkable thermoplastic. ‚ this means you can melt it, form it, melt it again, reform it -- in short, mold anything and recycle it. here are plastic fibers we've made from lignin. now we need to scale up to the 1000-pound range, and make different sorts of things, to establish the properties. ‚ we need to make demonstration objects to pitch this project to factory-scale investors. ‚ these green technology firsts will also become historic collectors items, and we're offering them to you as rewards. protecting our intellectual property rights with a patent is a key step in being able to take examples of our technology out to the world and find factory-scale supporters. if we're successful, we'll be back looking for development funds for the next project. ‚ if this is wildly successful, we won't have to be back for more funding. we'll keep you informed as we meet the challenges ahead. if you want to be more deeply involved in taking the next steps with us, we should talk. our team dr. gerald keep holds a phd in physical chemistry from stanford university. with 27 years of industrial experience, he is the main driver behind our innovative new product developments. he is named as inventor on eleven issued patents and has commercialized about $100m net-present-value of new products for the big guys. he is now the owner and president of missing octave insights. mr. bryan kleske is treasurer and site manager. a home brewer, gardener, craftsman, and former desk jockey for the big corporations, he has taken well to running the analytical lab, and keeping our renovated 100-year-old building from collapsing. mr. terry cutshall is our jack-of-all-trades, with skills ranging from international sales to running the fork truck. he has many years of experience in formulating asphalt and floor finish products, and has a deft hand in the lab. with funding cuts, we were down to one part-time analytical lab technician where we once had three. help us in reversing this trend! we've recently added a new graduate, holding a master's degree in cellular &amp; molecular nutrition with a focus on fatty acid metabolism, to help with projects and testing, until he heads off to medical school next year. current analytical capabilties this is what we have now. ‚ some may be lost soon, and some of that we'll mortage our building or something to replace. two gas chromatographs, one for liquid and one for vapor headspace sampling, used in molecular identification,‚ inductively coupled plasma, optical emission spectrometer, for elemental identification,‚ fourier transform infrared,‚ karl-fischer moisture,‚ refractive index,‚ laser particle detection,‚ platinum-cobalt (apha) color index by tube and fiber optic probe,‚ ph and ion concentration by ion specific electrodes,‚ burn testing by various methods including flash point for volatile liquids,‚ biodiesel testing including viscosity, carbon residue, cloud point, cold filter plug point, copper corrosion, oxidative stability, distillation temperature, centrifugation,‚ a host of classic wet chemistry analytical methods, ‚Ä¶ and more!‚ would love to get into cytography ‚Äì characterizing algae populations. existing lab above is some of the shiny new lab equipment we may lose. you can also see several instruments in the background of our project video. ‚ but we also have a lot of old workhorse tools below, many of which still need to be dusted off and hooked up. we also have an array of plastics equipment (and lots of friends with more) as well as physical property testers. a few of the many possible green businesses to pursue analytical testing for green companies, including biodiesel makers and algae farms. safe flame retardant systems for cotton and nylon fabrics. flame retardant mats, pads, and ceiling tiles from recycled carpet and newspaper. green formulations for floor care and household products. asphalt and other materials from paper mill waste. better ways to grow and harvest algae. energy and green chemicals from biomass.‚ so much to do, so little time!

(leafy greens)‚ of course this depends on environmental conditions. how often do i change the water? it is advisable to change your water every two weeks. this will allow for fresh nutrients to the plants and‚ cleaner water. if your water contains a lot of chlorine, its best to leave the water in an open environment for 24-48 hours. this process allows the chlorine to dissipate. how do i start the pyramid garden? easy! just plug it in to any conventional outlet, add nutrients to the water, check your ph balance and you're ready to grow! how do i configure my plants on pyramid garden? each plant has its own set of requirements for growth. depending on what you are growing, place your plants accordingly. for example, if you are growing vining plants like tomatoes, cucumbers, and green beans; plant them on one side of the pyramid. or plant them on the lower level of the pyramid for easier trellising if required. ‚ a little research on the plant you want to grow, will alleviate future problems. where should i place my pyramid garden? the pyramid garden can be placed anywhere where there is a good light source. light is a requirement for highly productive growth. if you live an area where there is high intense summer heat, it would be advisable to provide some shading. how much space do i need for the pyramid garden? you need 16 sq. feet. the dimensions for the pyramid garden are 4 feet by 4 feet. what is the pyramid garden made from? the planter is made with a food grade polyethylene core which is laminated with a uv resistant stove lacquered aluminum for superior strength. pyramid garden will last for many years to come! ‚ 
 the dub cadet is a ball you can hold in your hands, containing a hi-fi speaker and a computerized musical brain to transform any kind of rotation into live and original music. any turn, spin, or wiggle triggers a new chord based on the unique way you have moved the ball. i believe holographic musical instruments like the dub cadet will be commonplace in the future, showing up everywhere from schools (for education), to homes (for fun), to media offices (for creativity), and in music studios (for production). the reason is simple: free-from rotational control takes a complex process and radically simplifies it: it's a holographic musical instrument, which means the notes you play are determined by the angle you have turned the ball. in fact, the dub cadet contains no prerecorded melodies or beats. but it does pack specially designed musical dna to morph your motions into amazing colorized songs. effortlessly explore musical patterns like never before for hours of creative brainstorming, ear training, and fun. it's motions are tracked with the same cutting edge electronic gyroscopes used in smartphones, pedometers and the infamous segway . the data from these motion sensors is processed into real-time harmonies and solo notes using the arduino programming environment on a custom created circuit board. each note of the scale flashes to the beat of your harmonies to create a display of bright animated colors. for more videos see my youtube channel. improvised music has the charming ability to help us discover new possibilities through unexpected outcomes and 'happy accidents'. the problem is, it takes a lot of practicing to build up the skills and confidence to improvise. with the dub cadet, anyone can enjoy making spontaneous music that sounds great. it uses technology to bridge the gap so that anyone can play. this magical device enables: over 10,000 chord possibilities. endless rhythm possibilities. 52 polyphonic (multi-note) instrument voices. expressive 3d pitch-bend. self-amplified loudspeaker. headphone and midi output. visual music you can see and hear! several buttons let you discover sound in the moment and react to it dynamically, setting off a chain reaction of creative synthesis that i find downright revolutionary. it lets you do more with less, giving you a new interface to simply enjoy the unlimited combinations available. solo turns the ball into a big 3d pitch-bender that snaps to the notes in your scale for super-cool bendy solo's. loop repeats your last measure of notes while allowing the rhythm to continue morphing with your motion. arpeggio breaks each chord into pieces and plays them one note at a time at high-speed for a truly epic progression. drumbot plays a beat that reacts to your music to fill out the sound. scale selects the base scale or key signature used to form your chords. there are 16 varieties of scales to explore. voice selects one of 52 instruments to change the way the dub cadet sounds. make it sound like a trumpet, a guitar, a pitched drum, or classic 8-bit video game, to name a few. i've worked hard to design a product with features everyone can use and explore. by trying out lots of things, i've been able to keep only the best innovations and tailor them for an extremely flexible and fun musical play experience. it is well known that the mood of music is largely dependent on the specific scale or key signature that provides it's harmonic backbone. whether excited, relaxed, funny, ephemeral, or exotic, the feel of the music is created from the relationships formed between the notes. by changing scales, you can completely change the mood of the music. the dub cadet allows you to play in these 16 diverse scales coming from all over the world: adonai malakh, acoustic/lydian dominant, blues, enigmatic, flamenco, gypsy, harmonic major, harmonic minor, hirajÂçshi, pentatonic major, major, melodic minor, mixolydian, persian, prometheus, ukrainian dorian. the dub cadet is open source , meaning that anyone who knows a lick about computer programming can start playing with the code to make it do new things. if you have an inspiration for a new feature, you can add it right into the musical brain (arduino based atmega328 micro-controller) via usb.‚ i've worked hard to balance simple midi operation, streamlined features, and expandability so you can add your unique touch. being a midi instrument means it can be outputted to other midi synthesizers, voice banks, and computers for further processing. streaks of light formed by photographing with a slow shutter-speed. the inspiration: while working at pixar, i picked up a little secret for creating good character animation: every joint and every limb of the body moves in an arc as it travels through space. in other words, rotation is the fundamental action by which animals and humans move. it's a basic fact that you only really need to consider when animating. this little secret marinated with my longstanding pursuit of musical exploration until one day i had an inspiration: i wanted to design an instrument that used only rotation to make music. no keys to press, no levers to pull, no strings to strum. it would be a totally unconventional approach to music: a ball. since rotation is 3-dimentional, it would create a dynamic and super-unique way to structure sound. i was very curious to see how an instrument could use the motion curves of human movements to generate music. the dub cadet is the fruit of this pursuit. my daughter lydia actually inspired me to go forward and build the dub cadet. i saw her playing with toys one morning and it all clicked: rotation-toys-musical-instrument-improvised-gizmo. i understood that a rotational instrument in the shape of a ball would allow her to discover music in a way that was not currently possible. i've had a blast building the prototype and now i am very excited to keep revising and innovating upon the discoveries. the funding i hope to raise with kickstarter will take the dub cadet prototype as seen in the video and turn it into a mass produced gadget for you and your friends to enjoy. i will be buying materials at bulk rates to create a quality product that is also affordable. the mass produced dub cadet will measure 6.25 inches (158 mm)‚ in diameter and will be created through a 3d printing manufacturing process using stylish and eco-friendly pla plastic. pla is a plastic made from the renewable resources of sugarcanes or cornstarch. in addition to the ready to play dub cadet instrument, i am offering an unassembled kit with instructions for those that like to tinker. the kit will come together in about 2 hours max. the source code is available too! from beginner, to expert, or power-user; anyone can push the boundaries of what is possible with this musical platform. i've spent a lot of time organizing the pledge levels, so you can get a reward that's right for you. thanks very much for your support! note: all pledges include us shipping. non-us residents will need to add $25 usd to your donation to cover customs clearance and international shipping and handling. the dub cadet logo t-shirt! dub cadet technical specifications: power: 4 aaa batteries (6 v). analog audio: on-board loudspeaker: 3 watt, 3 inch diameter. midi output: 16 channel. max polyphony: 16 simultaneous sustained notes. headphone jack: 1/8 inch. 44.1 khz analog output. core electronics of the prototype: atmega328 (microprocessor) itg-3200 (mems gyroscope) vs1103 (midi/wav decoder) 5060brg4 (rgb leds) the purpose of this kickstarter page is to raise the funds needed to mass produce the dub cadet. pre-order yours today to get an inside look at how an idea turns into a real product. the best part is, you can get one of your own to enjoy!

 survey of space a fun educational exhibit about space and people to be loaned to museums, schools and libraries at low or no cost imagine this. a small library with few resources announces an exhibit‚Äîthey‚Äôre going to show artifacts, films and images telling stories about space exploration. the exhibit will describe and show people and events from the early space age, to the present‚Äîand look into the future. the library never did anything like this before. it didn‚Äôt have the money or resources. but they happened to have a few locking display cases. and they had a desire to educate and excite the local community. so they borrowed the exhibit‚Äîat no rental fee. they only paid shipping. the institution‚Äôs own insurance covered the protection of the artifacts. it was easy. some community members loaned tvs and dvd players to show the exhibit videos. and the whole exhibit was made possible by small donors giving $1 or $5 or $10 or $25 (maybe more!) to the exhibit developer. donors like you. what makes this project so special? well, first of all, you do. this project will demonstrate that ordinary people who care can, with little money, create a new thing that enriches the lives of people who live near small or underfunded museums, libraries and schools. but there‚Äôs more. the exhibit will be fun and interesting. it will focus on fascinating contributions by all kinds of people‚Äîfrom astronauts to "just some guy" who worked on the space program. and the exhibit will allow those attending to contribute to future editions. yeah, but i‚Äôm not interested in space. i‚Äôm very, very aware that only some people are interested in space flight. that‚Äôs why much of the exhibit will center on really interesting and amazing stories about people. nearly everyone is interested in a good story, well-told, about people. as a space enthusiast, it‚Äôs part of my ambition to increase interest in space...and not just talk to those who are already into it. want an example of a really interesting story? download my free ebook or read a story online about boris volynov. it‚Äôs one of the most exciting stories you never heard! (and it's only one example of what i have in mind...) what‚Äôs in it for me? for starters, you help to change the world. because, once we prove this model works‚Äîthat you can make exciting and educational exhibits to loan for free or nearly free‚Äîyou‚Äôve given a gift to the world. adults and children in neighborhoods and communities that couldn‚Äôt normally see anything like this...well, suddenly they can! you‚Äôll also share the credit, i‚Äôll put your name in the credits for the exhibit, on dvds used in the exhibit, and on the exhibit website. (it will be at http://www.surveyofspace.com ). or, for a slightly higher level of giving, you can also get a dvd showcasing content to the exhibit. oh, and if a sponsor (possibly you!) puts in a good word for, say, your local library to get the exhibit, that library will probably get it ahead of venues that don‚Äôt have such connections. (the order of requests, and the ability of the facility to display the exhibit and protect artifacts will also be factors.) ok, mr. curator‚Äîwhat‚Äôs in it for you? i get a few things. the first is, i get satisfaction at putting something really good into the world. i love museums and i‚Äôm fascinated by space. i want others to be interested in it, too. perhaps i‚Äôll create enthusiasm in some kids who will become important scientists or astronauts or some other kind of contributor to our future in space. i‚Äôd also like to work in the museum field. i‚Äôve had a hard time switching careers. i had considerably success in the past, co-founding an internet development and marketing company, and serving as president for a decade. but then i wanted to do something else‚Äîwork with museums. that‚Äôs been tough. i first volunteered, then landed a low-level position. my current position exposes me to a lot, and i‚Äôve learned quite a bit..but i‚Äôm not authorized to do much. i hold an mba with a concentration in marketing. i‚Äôm smart and hard working. i‚Äôm hoping that by showing what i can do here, i‚Äôll get more and better opportunities to help museums...either as a consultant or on staff. i‚Äôm not hindered by ingrained ideas in that field; as an outsider, i think about things differently. for example, i‚Äôm told that traveling exhibits are extraordinarily difficult, expensive and always lose money. i feel certain that‚Äôs wrong. i intend to demonstrate that. who are you? well, i‚Äôve already told you something about myself. i‚Äôm a guy who‚Äôs been a successful entrepreneur, who‚Äôs had a lot (too much?!) education, and who likes doing new things. i‚Äôm interested in space flight and in putting something good into the world. i‚Äôve worked in the past in profit companies (including one i co-founded), and spent many years working for nonprofits. i guess i‚Äôd describe myself as an imaginative, gutsy, pragmatic idealist. i hope you‚Äôll help me, because together we can do great things. oh, and one last thing: one reason that the exhibit costs are so low is that i already own the historical artifacts: i'm a space memorabilia collector. so, my budget is for printing, promotion and other‚Äîrelatively cheap‚Äîthings. thanks for listening. faq 
 problem the problem of hazardous air pollution (hap) from indoor cooking is well documented. please visit the united nations foundation "global alliance for clean cookstoves" website at http://www.cleancookstoves.org/. ‚ over 3 billion people are negatively impacted by hap, resulting in more than 4 millions deaths annually, as well as destroying more than 750 million tonnes of biomass and emitting more than 1 billion tonnes of co2. women and children are disproportionately affected as they more involved in household cooking chores. solution ‚ natural gas (ng) is the cleanest burning of all the fossil fuels and is one of the most abundant energy sources found in nature. however, ng is a currently underutilized energy resource due to a lack in the development of economical transportation, storage and utilization technologies.‚ ng is the ideal cooking fuel for indoor applications as it produce minimal pollutants, however until recently, no technology other than pipeline delivery enabled ng to be used in this sector. ‚ our company, pangaea energy limited (pel) has developed a residential adsorbed natural gas (ang) storage system to connect low cost energy to the people who need it the most. ‚ developed ‚ through the efforts of‚ dr. brian spencer (pel director) ‚ and‚ dr. brendan harvey (pel technology manager), our ang system has the potential to enhance the lives of millions while reducing their fuel costs. ‚ ‚ pel‚Äôs first major product is a portable ng cylinder that is equivalent in energy content to the 3 kg lpg cylinder. it holds 125 scf of gas, which should be sufficient for one week‚Äôs usage by a household for its cooking needs. to fill this cylinder in the us or indonesia would cost around $1.00 - $1.40. ‚ technology ang utilizes a process that accumulates gas on the surface of a solid, such as activated carbon material, which allows for the storage of ng at substantially higher volumetric capacities than pressurized storage using compressed natural gas at an equivalent pressure. because ang does not require cooling or high compression, the infrastructure for gas processing and loading have significantly lower capital and operating costs. ‚ ‚ another benefit of the low pressure requirements of ang is that it can be better utilized in residential applications. for example, a low pressure ang storage tank can be filled with natural gas from a domestic pipeline using a small single-stage compressor.‚ pel‚Äôs residential ang system combined with the propane (lpg) delivery business model, allows ng to be commercialized in a manner very similar to residential lpg deliveries. project team dr. brian spencer over the past 40 years, brian has become one of the industry leading experts in the design and development of composite components and manufacturing processes.his industry contributions have been recognized by his peers through his unanimous election to ‚Äòfellow‚Äô status in the sampe by its

(llnl) and conducts research on multiple disciplines of‚ engineering, materials science, laser physics, and applied physics, including rocket‚ science, robotics, and unmanned vehicles in addition to being a pioneer of‚ compressed hydrogen storage. spencer composites technical staff has been‚ updating him on their customer's issues with ng composite pressure vessels since‚ 2005. his research in economically advantageous hydrogen delivery infrastructures lead‚ him to conclude that the same models favored trucked delivery of ng in iso‚ shipping containers as early as 2007. dr. weisberg had been advocating‚ transportable ng energy storage in minimum‚Äêcomposite mass pressure vessel‚ designs when pel approached him to advise and contribute to‚ proposals on ang storage in 2011.‚ he is also a technology advisor to the pel board of directors. dr. brendan harvey brendan harvey is currently pursuing his doctorate in electrical engineering through the memorial university of newfoundland. having two degrees in mechanical engineering, his main research focus has been in alternative natural gas storage and utilization technologies. past employment activities have also revolved around various sub components of the oil and gas industry such as oil sands production, sub sea oil and gas production and transportation, and energy transport logistics. brendan is also a sessional professor at the memorial university of newfoundland in the area of fluid mechanics. ‚ once his ph.d. is complete, brendan will be joing pangaea energy as technology manager.‚ zachary spencer zachary spencer is engineering manager of spencer composites corporation,‚ sacramento, california. he is responsible for tooling design, fabrication, and process‚ development at scc. he is also a technology advisor to the pel board of directors. zack holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from south‚ dakota school of mines and technology in rapid city, south dakota. while at tech,‚ zack was instrumental in the design, engineering, and production phases of the‚ solar cars that raced for south dakota in sunrayce 95 and sunrayce 97. zack has been involved with research in the development of composite gun barrels,‚ thermoplastic winding technology, and composite/metal matrix techniques. he has‚ written several papers on composite applications and has participated in tutorials‚ and seminars throughout the united states. progress to date technology this started in 2009 with a master's thesis from dr. harvey and testing of various materials for adsorbent capacity with ng, and progressed for the past 5 years with various concepts, culminating in the 125,000 btu residential system shown in the figure above.‚ our prototypes have been designed, fabricated and tested at spencer composites corporation (http://www.spencercomposites.com). ‚ their facility in sacramento is an asme qualified manufacturer so their products can be stamped as asme certified pressure vessels.‚ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3pukw5u8by commercial we have signed a memorandum of understanding with a ng distribution company in indonesia to run a pilot project in the province of west java, indonesia. ‚ however, we need to have a facility to serve as re-filling station completed before we can commence pilot project operations.‚ ‚ ‚ use of proceeds we are seeking funds to buy an existing mobile propane refilling facility and convert it to fill our natural gas cylinders. ‚ the conversion will include: replacing the propane fill system with a ng fill system (~ 200 psi vs 600 psi) installing a purge system once we have completed this final step, we will be able to demonstrate complete system operation to potential investors, clients and regulatory bodies. ‚ this will expedite the near-term objective of having the refilling station and 300 of our cylinders put in operation in a pilot project in either indonesia or peru.‚ the ultimate objective is to de-risk the technology and the business model to the point sufficient for institutional investors to finance a dedicated refilling facility capable of providing ng to thousands of households why we need to do this! sustainable development is achievable as we show in the figure below, when you are dealing with an issue that is killing over 4 million women and children per year, the sad reality is the ability to put a price on saving individual lives. ‚ for every $2-3m put into a residential cookstove project, converting biomass users to ng, will save between 150-600 lives annually, or between $500 and $1000 per life. ‚ the variability is due to the range of mortality figures from various countries, current fuel quality, and availability of ng. this would also save 25,000 tonnes of biomass annually with more than 500,000 tonnes of co2 emissions reduced over the life of the project.‚

 welcome . . . thank you for checking out my crowdgrant project. bestechnical is small upstart that i am using to launch my newest idea, the maverick engine-generator. why maverick? well because being independent, different, and a little non-conformist is what i believe in; but i can't do it alone. i hope as you read along you too will share the same desire i do in making a difference. objective . . . the goal of this project is to finalize the design of the new maverick engine-generator, build a prototype, and perform some testing. what it is . . . the maverick engine-generator is a newly designed engine and linear generator that is integrated into one assembly, designed to eliminate two areas of inefficiency associated the modern day internal combustion engine. the first improvement of the engine-generator is a linear design, in which the majority of the energy created by the engine is transferred to the linear generator where the mechanical energy is converted directly to electrical energy and then stored or used as desired. this circumvents the conventional process; where traditionally all oscillating motion is converted to rotational motion via a crankshaft. the second improvement utilizes the use of waste heat produced by the internal combustion engine. typically, energy (in the form of heat) is rejected through the exhaust and radiator of an internal combustion engine. the maverick engine-generator uses the excess heat to, 1) power a vapor expansion cycle in a subsequent cylinder and, 2) pre-heat the fluid that is to be injected for the vapor expansion cycle. how it works . . . the "left" side of the engine operates on a standard otto or diesel cycle. that is: intake, compression, expansion (power), exhaust, and repeat. the maverick engine-generator takes the combustion exhaust, and intakes it into the vapor cylinder, on the "right" side of the engine. the combustion exhaust is compressed, and the pre-heated fluid is injected, where the heat in the cylinder converts it to vapor and the expansion drives the piston down producing work. the exhaust from the vapor cylinder is then condensed and is re-heated by the water jacket around the combustion cylinder. the combustion piston and the vapor piston are connected by the linear generator connecting rod. the oscillating energy of the pistons is converted into electrical energy by the linear generator. the maverick engine also uses a conventional (auxiliary) connecting rod, crankshaft, and fly wheel; which (in the diagram below) is connected to the combustion piston. this is used to limit the travel of the pistons, store energy, start the engine, power camshafts, and power various other needs of the engine. however, the majority of the energy produced by the engine is converted directly to electrical output by the linear generator. patent pending. 
 i had an idea back in january, just like having cruise control for speed, have vision system control for direction. the project is also my senior project for engineering technology at the university of memphis. i have been working on the source code that uses a ms kinect to read the lanes on the street and send feedback to an arduino to steer a car left or right. i have made progress working on my own, but i do need some financial backing, because i am very limited in computer resources. i have already invested over $300 in this project and would like a chance to exceed my original goal of just having the car turn left or right. i want to use a faster laptop, since the one i have now is not fast enough to use the ms kinect sdk. i'm unable to upgrade this laptop anymore and don't have enough funding to purchase another. many times i wonder, how powerful is a vision system on a car? now i have the ability to push it to it's limits. so far i have a 1/10th scale model car. the goal is to have a‚ functioning‚ autonomous car by november 15th. my long term goal is to install a kinect on the front of my car. there are many ideas i have that i just don't have the funds to incorporate. my project so far uses the vision system to read the scale model road. i am working on a way to send this feedback to the arduino. there is one servo that controls the steering of the wheels on the rc car and the output to the drive motor still needs to be automatic. my power sources are 120v ac, a 9v dc battery for the ardunio, and a 12v rechargeable battery pack for the rc car. my goal is to create a circuit that lets me power to kinect through batteries. if you would like to help me on my project and reach my computer resources goal or even to help purchase more materials for construction please check out my rewards page. 
 once upon a time... puneet loves running - outdoors - in woods and on road. he has now been running for the past 5 years. he uses a garmin (forerunner) watch to track his runs outdoors and also sometimes uses mapmyrun app on his iphone.‚ last year he started practicing high intensity interval trainings on a treadmill. he discovered that there was no convenient way to keep track of his runs on a treadmill. and he is not the only one with this problem! after several brainstorming sessions with dr. peter (introduced in video), who used to be professional runner (till he decided to treat people with running injuries), we came up with a rather straightforward solution - use an ir sensor to measure the number of times a reflective strip reflected stuck on the running belt reflected light from an ir led. however, stuck tape tends to peel off and wear out. besides, you would need to measure the exact length of the band or use two tapes etc - complicated! so we used a mechanical roller with a white strip on it. the number of times it cuts the ir led-detector sensor is counted as one rotation which translates into an exact linear distance. these revolutions of the roller are transferred over bluetooth to an app running on a smartphone. we have kept cloudracer simple and portable:‚ it is quick and easy to connect and disconnect and can be mounted on most models of treadmills.‚ it can be connected to the front or back of the treadmill to suit your running preferences.‚ no alterations / modifications required to the treadmill. cloudracer has a built-in rechargeable battery and, therefore, does not require messy cables. it connects to your smartphone via bluetooth and does not require a wifi connection.‚ that makes it possible to use in your basement where the wifi connection might be weak and also in a gym where wifi might not be available at all. the logged data is transferred from your smartphone to your cloudracer account. this data can be retrieved in the app history using your smartphone.‚ you can link the cloudracer app to your facebook and twitter accounts and share your runs with your friends and followers at the press of a button. cloudracer is portable - you can take it with you to your gym and use it to track your run there or install it on your treadmill at home.‚ app on ios x &amp; android: the app is available on both android and ios x platforms. the app is initially developed on the android platform and then ported to ios. once testing is done with certified devices from the first production run are available, the apps are to be made available on the app stores. electronics: this was the relatively straight-forward part of the project! we went for the microchip rn41 bluetooth module for communication with the smartphone. it is rather expensive, however, works equally well for android and ios platforms. here are more details:‚ http://bit.ly/mcrn41 the microcontroller we chose is the one that we have successfully used in other products - ti's msp430 due to its very low power consumption and relatively limited processing and i/o capabilities and yet a perfect fit for the functionality required in cloudracer. mounting cloudracer on a treadmill: note: another alternative is to mount cloudracer below the belt of the treadmill. the mounting procedure depends on the frame of your treadmill. given the large number of frame shapes and makes of treadmills, we leave the mounting up to your creative skills.‚ production schedule: september 2013 :‚ * place order for making moulds * place order for components and get fabrication of pcbs started october 2013:‚ * get first engineering samples * get ce &amp; fcc certification november 2013: * testing pre-production samples to validate production quality * production start december 2013: * ship the first batch of cloudracers to supporters of kickstarter campaign‚ use of funds raised: through this campaign, we need to raise funds for two very specific and expensive activities: get an aluminum mould made that can then be used to produce the external casing of the cloudracer. in addition come the tooling costs and the moq (mininium order quantity) for the first production run that have been included in the rewards. get a ce &amp; fcc certification to allow the sale of this product specifically in europe and north america. this is a straightforward process that takes between 4 and 8 weeks but costs several thousand dollars. we already have a slot booked in october for the certification. stretch goals: if we exceed our target goal to get to $ 40,000, we will add the additional hardware (sensors) required to measure incline of the treadmill and add the functionality in the apps - both for android and ios. if we get to $ 75,000, we will offer cloudracer in 4 additional colors: dawn orange, olive green, sky blue and ‚ sunny yellow.
