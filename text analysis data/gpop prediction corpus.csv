John Barr Well, thank you. And welcome to the AGA Medical first quarter 2010 earning conference call. With me on the call today are Brigid Makes, Chief Financial Officer, Roland Lund, our General Counsel and Rachel Ellingson, Senior Director of Business Development and Investor Relations. Our plan this morning is for Brigid to provide a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter 2010. I will then provide some business highlights from the quarter and we will open up the call for your questions. Before I turn the call over to Brigid, I would like to start the call by saying that we're off to a very strong start for 2010 and pleased with our first quarter results. We had solid sales growth across all products and all geographies, clearly demonstrating the benefit of our investment in developing strong global sales channels. In addition, we had strong recruitment results in our PFO trials demonstrating the strength of our clinical team. Our spending was inline with our expectations and our strong gross margins continue to allow us to invest in the pipeline programs which are key to our mission of developing innovative medical devices that can change the status of careful patients. In this quarter, we successfully achieved two significant milestones for the company, one clinical milestone with FDA approval to begin the clinical trial in the U.S. to evaluate the safety in efficacy of our AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug to close the left atrial appendage and one business milestone with the settlement of our path litigation with Medtronic or to which we will discuss in further detail later in the call. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Brigid. Brigid Makes Thanks, John. And again, welcome to everyone on the call this morning. The first quarter of 2010 was a strong sales quarter for AGA Medical with reported net sales of $51.3 million versus $44.4 million in the prior year. This represents a year-over-year net sales growth of 15.4% as reported in 11.9% on a constant currency basis. For the quarter, atrial septal occluder sales represented 50.9% of sales, PFO Occluder sales represented 14.8% of net sales, Vascular plug represent a 10% of net sales. In other devices including devices to close ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus and the AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug to close the left atrial appendage, accounted for 12.7% of net sales. Accessories that are used in the procedure, such as delivery systems and sizing balloons, represented 11.6% of net sales. Direct sales in North America represented 38.9% of net sales. Direct sales in Europe accounted for 42.3% of net sales and distributors who cover the rest of the world accounted for 18.8% of net sales. As we have reported, we converted six distributors at the beginning of January 2009 with our distributor converging largely completed our first quarter of 2010 versus 2009 is a clean comparison in terms of growth rate. Sales in North America grew 11.9% versus the prior year. Direct sales in Europe grew 17.8% largely due to the availability certain product sold outside the U.S. and not yet approved in the U.S. Those products include Patent Foramen Ovale or PFO device. Our second product that close patent ductus arteriosus is the AMPLATZER Duct Occluder II. The AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug to close the left atrial appendage and our latest version of the vascular plug III and AMPLATZER vascular plug IV or AVP IV. Our distributor sales representing the rest of the world grew 17.9%. Overall gross for the first quarter was principally driven by higher unit growth with some benefit from currency. Our fastest growing product line continues to be our vascular business, which experience strong revenue growth in the first quarter of 2010, up 67% worldwide. While, the vascular business on impressive revenue growth in North America at 42%, Europe continuous to experience significant momentum with a 103% revenue growth versus the first quarter of 2009. All versions of the vascular plug are approved in Europe, in each plug product, we saw an increase in volume, but Europe's impressive performance continuous to be driven by sales of the AVP IV which was launched in Europe in the third quarter of 2009. Our PFO business continuous to perform as we see the benefit of having direct sales force in terms of our ability to better understand our customers and undertake market development initiative. In Q1, PFO sales grew 11% from the prior period. In terms of our AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug, we continue to be pleased with the performance of this device and acceptance by the physician community outside of the United States. As previously stated we hope to break our sale of this device as the separate line item by the end of 2010. Now, let me move down the P&L to gross margins. Our performance at the gross margin line was strong for the quarter with gross margin at 85.9% versus 80.2% in the same quarter last year. When you look at last year, remember that we've repurchased inventory from distributor for our conversation to direct distribution in January of 2009. The excess cost of that inventory was amortized to our cost of good, which was completed in May of 2009. Without this impact, gross margin would have been 85.6% in the first quarter of 2009 versus 85.9% in the first quarter 2010. Total operating expense for the quarter was $40.6 million including $31.9 million one time $1 million charge - one-time charge associated with Medtronic litigation settlement. The $40.6 million compares to $35.7 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $42.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. In March, 2010, we settled our path litigation with Medtronic relating to the January 2007 patent infringement action brought against us. The settlement agreement calls for us to paying Medtronic $35 million in four payments over the next four years. As a result, we are taking a $31.9 million charge in the first quarter reflecting the discounted value of the total settlement amount. The $3.1 million difference between the $35 million and the $31.9 million will be accredited to interest expense over the next four years. The agreement calls for payment of $7.5 million in April of 2010, which we have made and additional payments of $7.5 million in January 2012 and payments of $10 million in January of 2013 and in 2014. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter were $25.4 million, up from $22.7 million in the prior year period, but down $1.6 million sequentially from $27 million reported in Q4 2009. This is primarily due to lower legal fee. The increase in expenses from the prior year was associated with strengthening our sales force in Europe as well as North America. R&D expenses increased to $10.2 million in Q1 of 2010 as compared to $7.9 million in Q1 of 2009, largely due to increase spending on our clinical trials as a result of strong patient enrollment. Specifically, enrollment in the RESPECT trial, our PFO stroke trial was ahead of plan in the first quarter and contributed to the year-over-year increase. We also effectively re-launched premium, our PFO-Migraine trial in the U.S. in the first quarter, which contributed to increase expenses. Remember that we've received FDA approval for a significant change to our enrollment protocol last year, which we believe has the potential to accelerate patient recruitment into the trial on a sustained basis. It is important to know that spending in our clinical trials is driven by enrollment. In the future, there maybe some limited volatility in R&D spending based on the rate of enrollment in the trial. In this case, the faster pace of enrollment in respect is clearly a highlight for the quarter as it hopefully gets us closer to the end of the trial. We are pleased with our patient recruitment effort and John will provide a further update on our clinical trial later in the call. EBITDA excluding the litigation settlement charge was $9.4 million for Q1 of 2010 - excuse me - versus $4.3 million in the prior year. The difference in EBITDA has driven primarily by our higher sales in margin, currently offset by the investment and infrastructure that I described previously. The favorable comparison is also held by the write-off of $2.3 million of an investment in an early stage of the company that we took in the first quarter of 2009. We reported a net loss under GAAP of $21.2 million for the first quarter in 2010, which included a charge of $31.9 million for Medtronic settlement. Excluding that charge, net income before dividend was $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to a net loss before dividend of $6.4 million in the same period a year ago. Now, let me talk about non-GAAP EPS, given the high amortization expenses associated with our business and the expenses associated with Medtronic litigation settlement, we thought it would be helpful to provide non-GAAP net income in earnings per share information that would adjust for this charges. As details in our press release, non-GAAP adjusted net income applicable for common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2010 with $4.2 million versus $3.4 million in a same period of the prior year and for fully diluted share was $0.08 for the three months ended March 31, 2010 versus $0.08 for the prior year period. I'd like to remind you that these earnings per share number is not adjusted to reflect legal fees associated with Medtronic in the first quarter of 2010. Now, let me make a few comments relating to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $13.2 million in cash, a decrease of $11.3 million from our cash position as of December 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily due to approximately $8 million of cash payment in accordance with our distributor conversion agreement, $5.8 million associated with lower working capital primarily due to payment to employee under the company's annual incentive compensation plan and $2.8 million in higher restricted cash associated with certain litigation appeal. Accounts receivable totaled $50.3 million, an increase of $1.6 million from December 31, 2009, the company's day sales outstanding or DSO is 88 days, however, if the associate - if the activity associated with our Southern European business were excluded, the DSO would be 58 days for North America, the remainder of Europe and our distributors itself to the rest of the world. We are aggressively managing collection to various programs such factoring in certain country and we'll continue to do so. Inventory doing stable to $12.4 million as of March 31, 2010. There are also two new line items on our balance sheet as a result of our litigation settlement. We have recorded a short-term liability of $7.5 million to reflect payments due Medtronic in April of 2010, which I mentioned we already paid and a long-term liability of approximately, 24.4 million to reflect the discounted remaining payments due over the next four years. In summary, we are very pleased with the quarter, highlighted by strong sales and gross margin, and operating expenses that were overall in line with our expectation. R&D was high - quietly higher than expected primarily due to strong performance of our clinical group in the enrollment or our RESPECT trial. Our legal expenses were lower than expected primarily due to the timing of the litigation settlement with Medtronic. Now, let me provide a few comments and guidance for 2010. We are reaffirming our financial guidance for 2010, which was provided on our Q4 2009 earnings call. Although, the U.S. dollar has strengthen since providing our prior guidance, in preparing our full year guidance, the 2010 guidance, we had used exchange rates, which assume the euro would be in the range of $1.32 to $1.38. We continue to expect net sales for 2010 to be in the range of $221 million to $226 million, which represents an 11% to 14% growth over 2009. However, a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, could impact our results throughout the year. We expect our gross margin to be approximately 85%, excluding the charges associated with the settlement of our patent litigation. We expect EBITDA to be in the range of $56 million to $59 million and non-GAAP as adjusted net income for diluted share, which also exclude approximately $20.5 million of amortization expenses to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.54 per share, assuming approximately $51 million diluted, a fully diluted shares outstanding. Now, let me now turn the call back to John to review some of the operational highlights. John Barr Thank you, Brigid. Brigid has covered many of the financial highlights of our business. Let me shift the focus a bit and update you on some of our clinical programs that are intended to expand the market opportunities of two of our products that are sold in Europe today, our PFO occlusion device and our AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug. Our RESPECT study is designed to study whether PFO closure is superior to medical management in preventing recurring stroke. There is one to one randomization in the two arms. The study uses an adaptive model, permitting periodic looks at the data by an independent data safety monitoring board, sometime referred to as DSMB. The study may be stopped by the DSMB if certain pre-defined stopping rules are achieved, indicating that the end point has been met. Due to the strong performance of our clinical team and study centers, we have seen strong and steady enrollment in the last several quarters. The last three months were strong than any comparable period of the trial. As of April 30, 2010, 726 patients have been enrolled in the study and 1,352 patient follow-up years have been accrued. We are very proud of this performance and believe our team can maintain this momentum going forward. We have filed two of the three modules for our PMA submission for RESPECT and are working with the FDA to move through that process. The third and final, excuse me, PMA submission contains the clinical data, which will be filed when the trial is complete. This rolling submission will allow us to work on approval of the non-clinical aspects of the application, while continuing enrollment in the study. Following what we hope will be a successful outcome of the study. We will only need to file the final module of the PMA. In addition to our stroke trial, our clinical trial Premium is designed to measure whether PFO closure can result in a meaningful reduction in the number and severity of migraine headaches in patients that have a significant PFO, while experiencing the significant number of headache days per month and have failed at least three medications. As we mentioned in our fourth 2009 call, we gained approval of a significant change to that protocol that we believe has the potential to accelerate enrollment in the study on a sustain basis, that protocol has been approved at all sites and we have enrolled patients under that protocol at multiple sites. In parallel, we have invested and we’ll continue to invest in patients recruiting programs and based on early results. We are cautiously optimistic that the protocol changes along with our recruiting efforts will enable us to accelerate enrollment. We hope to be in the position update our shareholders in the second half of this year on enrollment and study, and also forecast when the study is likely to be completed. Next, I’ll switch gears and discuss the AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug. To remind you again, this is for left atrial appendage closure. In March, we received conditional Investigational Device Exemption or IDE approval from the FDA to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug to close the left atrial appendage. This trial is designed to demonstrate efficacy and preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation patients who are eligible to receive Warfarin, as well as safety of the device and the procedure. The clinical study will be a multi-center study up to 90 centers, with two to one randomization between AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug and patients continuing on Warfarin. This trial design includes a feasibility phase to be followed by a pivotal phase. Up to 10 clinical sites will participate in the feasibility phase of the study and we are started investigational review, board reviews at these sites. We expect to randomize, excuse me again, we expect to randomize our first patient in the feasibility phase of the clinical trial by the end of the second quarter of 2010. As you are aware, the AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug is CE marked, and we are currently selling the device throughout Europe, South America and the Pacific Rim. We are pleased with the performance of the device to date and excuse me, we are pleased with performance of the device to date and the reaction to position that use this device. The trend suggest a learning curve for safety and technical success that is comparable to other AMPLATZER devices. We are working in parallel to implement our focus marketing effort targeting electrophysiologists that treat the underlying disease atrial fibrillation. We believe that inventional cardiologist, trained and experience in repairing structural heart defects, along with electrophysiologists represent the two most important physician groups to educate and train on left atrial appendage closure. In parallel, we are working hard on obtaining reimbursement on a country-by-country basis in Europe, both efforts expanding physician use the electrophysiologist and reimbursement approval should have a positive impact on making left atrial appendage closure and more routine procedure in the market we have targeted. Let me now shift focus again and provide a brief legal update, which will be shorter than the legal updates on our last two quarterly earnings call. As you may recall, in August 2009 we announced a jury verdict in the first part of the Medtronic trial. Medtronic alleged that our products infringed two patents. In March 2010, we settle this patent litigation for $35 million to repay in four payments over four years. We believe this is a very favorable outcome for us as it eliminates much of the expense and uncertainty associate with the litigation. In addition it provides us with a fully paid up license for the patents and dispute known as the Jervis patents. This license not only covers existing products but also any future products that we develop and commercialized which use nitinol. In summary, the first quarter of 2010 was a strong start to the year. Our financial performance was solid with strong sales results and discipline investment in areas that provide the most significant opportunities to accelerate our growth rates. Our clinical and regulatory teams have done an outstanding job with patient recruitment efforts in our ongoing PFO clinical trials and in obtaining FDA approval to begin our AMPLATZER Cardiac Plug trial in the U.S. We look forward to continuing the momentum for the balance of the year, and continuing to update the shareholders on our progress. With that, operator, could you please open the call for questions."
1,GV_025180_2008Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Cynthia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2008 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today Tuesday April 29, 2008. I would now like to introduce Greg Peterson, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Peterson. Please go ahead sir. Greg Peterson Thank you Cynthia and good morning and thank you for joining us for AGCO's first quarter 2008 earnings conference call. During this call, we will refer to a slide presentation. The slides, earnings press release and our financial statements are posted on our website at agcocorp.com. The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides. On the call with me this morning are, Mr. Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started this morning, let me remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, supplier and production constraints, farm income, working capital improvement, cash flow, margins effective tax rate, capital expenditure and strategic initiatives. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. These documents discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. I will now turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Thank you Greg and good morning. I'll begin my remarks on slide 3 where you can see that we had a very good start to the year. We posted record quarterly sales and earnings. Our sales increased approximately 34% compared to the first quarter of 2007 and our adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter were up 142% compared to the first quarter last year. We used our well positioned brands to leverage very healthy market conditions and produce strong results in the quarter. Our EAME [Europe/Africa/Middle East] segment continues to grow strongly and improve its profitability. In Europe, our Fendt brand performed well, showing the best sales and margin improvement. Recall that during the first quarter of 2007, our Fendt sales were artificially low as we were initiating production on our new high horsepower series tractors and experienced supply constraints. Both of these events negatively impacted our sales during the first quarter of 2007. The South American market continues to respond to strong commodity prices. In Brazil, acreage devoted to corn, soybeans and sugarcane has expanded and crop production is expected to be up from 2007 levels. Market conditions in Argentina also were very good in the first quarter. However, government restrictions on grain export resulted in a disruption in the market late in the quarter that may impact industry demand there in the coming months. In North America, record 2007 farm income is driving strong sales in high horsepower tractor and combines. The slowing in the general economy softened demand for compact and utility tractors that are more often used in non-farming applications. On slide 4, you can see our production schedule for 2007 and 2008. Tractor and combine production levels were up 25% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. Production was up to support the strong growth in global demand. The increased production occurred across all regions with nearly all of our production facilities experiencing double-digit unit growth compared to the first quarter of 2007. Our current 2008 forecast calls for unit production of tractors and combines to increase 12% to 14% compared to the 2007 levels in order to satisfy the forecasted increase in the market demand. The strong global demand for industrial and farm equipment continued to put stress on AGCO's supply chain. As we told you last quarter, we are working with our existing suppliers to prepare them for expected demand levels and we are also working to qualify new suppliers to mitigate future supply constraints. The strong market conditions have at or near capacity in some internal assembly and production operations and we are making investments in some of our facilities to expand capacity. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first quarter of 2008. Industry tractor sales in North America were down 11% compared to 2007 levels. The weakest segment continued to be tractors under 40 horsepower that are more closely tied to the general economy. We also experienced declines in the 40 to 100 horsepower category. The professional farming segment continues to benefit from higher commodity prices, which contributed to an increase of approximately 30% in the over 100 horsepower tractor segment and growth in the combine market of over 12% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter of 2007. AGCO total unit tractor sales were down in the first quarter of 2008 due to the market weakness in compact and utility tractors. Consistent with the market, however, AGCO unit sales of tractors over 100 horsepower and combines both showed strong growth during the first quarter. For the full year of 2008, we expect weakness in tractor under 100 horsepower and strong growth in the high horsepower tractors in the North American industry retail [ph] market. Industry tractor volumes were up approximately 3% in Europe in the first quarter of 2008 versus last year. Strong market conditions in France, the United Kingdom, Central and Eastern Europe and Spain are offsetting weaker markets in Italy, Finland and Scandinavia. Our forecast for 2008 calls for market conditions in Europe to remain healthy with continued strong growth in Central and Eastern Europe and modest growth in Western Europe. South American industry tractor volumes increased approximately 45% during the first quarter of 2008. Brazil's industry tractor volumes were up 47% and Argentina's industry tractor sales increased 64% compared to the first quarter of 2007. Combine sales more than doubled in Brazil and also showed improvement in Argentina. In 2008, we expect the market in both Brazil and Argentina to remain strong and contribute to an increase in South American industry demand compared to 2007's robust levels. Globally, the markets are very healthy and our order books remain ahead of where they stood at this time last year. I will now turn the call over to Andy who will provide you with more details on our results. Andrew H. Beck Thank you Martin. Referring to slide 6 which highlights AGCO's regional net sales, the chart on the right shows our regional sales performance excluding the impact of currency translation. For the first quarter of 2008, currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 13%. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the Europe, Africa, Middle East segment had sales growth of approximately 20% during the first quarter of 2008. The growth in our European region was led by sales increases in Germany, France and Eastern Europe. North American sales increased approximately 10% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the first quarter 2007, excluding currency translation impacts. As Martin mentioned, sales increases in our high horsepower tractors and combines were responsible for much of the growth. In South America, first quarter 2008 sales improved approximately 44% from the prior year excluding currency translation impacts. Robust farm economics and expanding plantings in Brazil have led to strong demand for tractors and combines. We also saw improved sales in Argentina. Our first quarter 2008 sales in our Asia-Pacific segment increased approximately 28% excluding the impact of currency. Significantly improved harvests in Australia and New Zealand are producing better sales. Part sales for the first quarter of 2008 were $225 million, up 15.4% compared to the same period in 2007 after removing the impact of currency translation. Slide 7 highlights our sales and margin performance. Operating margins for the first quarter of 2008 were up from 2007 levels due to sales growth, improved product mix in Europe and cost control initiatives, partially offset by currency impacts in North America. Our Europe, Africa, Middle East margins, which reached 9.3% in the first quarter of 2008 were up approximately 330 basis points compared to 2007 due to improved volumes and product mix. In the first quarter of 2008, we had a relatively normal mix of products whereas the mix in 2007 was weighted more towards mid range and low horsepower tractors due to the initial production of Fendt's new high horse powertractor series as well as supplier constraints at our German plant. Last year, Fendt sales and production were high in the third quarter due to delays experienced in the first six months of 2007, especially for the margin rich high horsepower models. In 2008, we expect this impact to reverse in the third quarter and we expect our margins and earnings in the third quarter of 2008 to be negatively impacted. Volume growth in our South American business produced operating margins of 10.7% for the first quarter of 2008, up slightly from 2007 despite pressure from currency impacts associated with sales of equipment manufactured in Brazil and exported to other South American markets. Operating margins in North America continue to be pressured by the appreciation of the Brazilian real and the euro on the Brazilian and French-made tractors sold in North America. Our effective tax rate was approximately 36% in the first quarter of 2008 and we expect the tax rate to be in the mid 30% range for the full year. Moving on to slide 8 highlights the progress we're making with our working capital reduction as we focus on improving our return on assets. At the end of the first quarter, AGCO's working capital to sales ratio stood at 7.7%, down from 11.3% one year ago. Our goal this year will be hold the line on working capital despite the strong sales growth we're expecting this year. Compared to the first quarter of 2007, we saw improvement across all categories in North America dealer inventory month supply. At the end of March 2008, our dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors, 3.5 months for combines and 6.5 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows. Outstanding funding under accounts receivable securitization programs was approximately $497.8 million at the end of March 2008 compared to $419.8 million at the end of March 2007. Wholesale interest bearing receivables transferred to AGCO Finance, our retail joint venture... retail finance joint venture in North America as of March 31, 2008 were approximately $76.5 million. Losses on sales receivable primarily under our securitization facilities, which is included in other expense net, were $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2008 compared to $6.7 million for the same period in 2007. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Our seasonal demands for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby generate negative free cash flow in the first quarter of 2008 and 2007. As you saw on slide 8, we are continuing to focus on our working capital, but we expect to have a smaller benefit in 2008 compared to 2007. On our Q4 '07 earnings call in February, we shared our plan with you to invest in more... more in 2008 and for future growth. We expect to increase research and development, new product-related capital expenditures and system development costs. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we expect to generate strong free cash flow this year. Slide 10 shows the improvements we made in our capital and how we are... and how our net debt to capital... to total capital ratios have improved over the last two years. Our net debt to capital ratio was approximately 18% at quarter-end 2008 compared to 36% one year ago. Total debt was $719 million at the end of the first quarter of 2008. We are pleased with the progress that we have made with our balance sheet and overall leverage. Most importantly, we believe we are in good position to fund our strategic investment requirements in the future. Interest expense net for the first quarter of 2008 was $5.1 million versus $6.7 million in the first quarter of 2007. The interest savings were generated by lower debt levels and increased interest income earned in 2008 compared to 2007. Slide 11 quantifies the impact of our 2008 strategic initiatives. We will be making significant investments in our future in the form of increased engineering expenses to support a growing list of new product programs, costs associated with our European system initiative and spending associated with developing new markets and improving our distribution. We will be relying on our sales and margin growth to pay for these investments while generating an improvement in earnings in 2008 compared to 2007. Our initiative spending is focused on long-term growth and profitability improvements for our company. Our first quarter results were impacted by approximately $13 million of this strategic spend. Slide 12 lists our latest view of selected 2008 financial goals. We're projecting 2008 sales to increase 20% to 22%, driven by pricing, healthy market conditions and the positive impact of currency. We are targeting 2008 EPS to range from $3 to $3.15 while making significant investments in our long-term initiatives. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $190 million to $200 million range and our free cash flow to remain strong in the $175 million to $200 million range. For the second quarter of 2008, sales growth is expected to be in the 25% to 30% range compared to the second quarter of 2007 with the second quarter margins expected to be similar to those seen in the second quarter of 2007. That concludes our comments. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions. Question And Answer"
2,GV_025180_2009Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning my name is Terry [ph] and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2009 First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Greg Peterson. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks Terry, good morning. We appreciate you joining us for ACGCO's First Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will refer to a slide presentation. The slides, earnings press release and our financial statements are posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, growth, production levels, work force adjustments, plant rearrangements, factory process improvements, market conditions, industry demand, weather conditions, availability of financing, general economic conditions, currency translation impacts, commodity prices, farm income, working capital improvement, cash flow, effective tax rate, interest expense, new product investments, pricing levels, engineering, research and development, capital expenditures and strategic initiatives. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and an actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2008. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. I will now turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my remarks on Slide 3, where you can see that in the first quarter of 2009, AGCO felt the effects of the softer market demand, the tightened credit environment and the impact of a stronger dollar, compared to the first quarter of 2008. Farm economics remain healthy but farmers' sentiment has been hurt by the global recession and the ongoing financial crisis. Farmers have become more conservative with their equipment purchase decisions. In the face of this difficult environment, we continue to focus on adjusting our production and operating expenses, to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing working capital. Despite a strong turmoil in the commodity markets, we remain confident that long-term agricultural fundamentals are excellent. Strong harvests are still required to meet the growing demand for food and biofuel requirements. We expect global grain inventories to continue to be below historical averages and commodity prices and farm income to remain above historical levels. Our optimism for the long-term demand for our product is driving continued investment in our long-term growth initiatives. While we do plan to manage our production and working capital very closely this year, we are planning for substantial investment in engineering expenses and capital expenditures. Our first quarter sales, operating margins and earnings were all down from the first quarter of 2008, as shown on Slide 3. Now, I will take a minute to touch on two of the bright spots in the quarter. In the seasonally-weakest first quarter, our North America segment remained profitable. Much of improvement in North America is the result of the turnaround in our Sprayer business. Last year, we moved to distribution of our sprayers to the Caterpillar dealers and we have been investing more in new products. Both efforts have helped return our Sprayer business to profitability. Our Fendt plant, which is our technology leader in Europe, continued its strong growth. Most of Fendt's growth was in the largest tractor models, the Vario 800 and 900 series. Slide 4 illustrates our production volumes for 2008 and our current forecast for 2009. First quarter 2009 tracked time combined production levels were down 5%, compared to the first quarter of 2008. You can see from this chart that we are making aggressive cuts in the remainder of the year in an effort to reduce our inventory levels. The deepest cut is expected in the second quarter, when our production is scheduled to be down approximately 30%, compared to the second quarter of 2008. These cuts will have a significant impact on our second quarter sales and earnings. For the full year of 2009, our production of tractors and combines is expected to be down about 15 to 20% from 2008 levels. Geographically, our biggest production declines are plant for our South American factories. The industry demand has been impacted most severely. In the first quarter we made workforce reductions in South America and reduced the number of temporary employees in our European factories. We have a ready- made further workforce adjustments in the second quarter to match changes in demand. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first quarter of 2009. Industry tractor sales in North America were down 20% compared to 2008 levels. The weakest segment was the under 100-horsepower tractors, which are more closely tied to the redemption construction and general economic conditions. Row crop tractors were still strong from historical perspective, but were down slightly from last year's robust levels. The combined market grew approximately 33% in the first quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. We believe the increase is the result of timing for deliveries for competitors' presale programs, which were pulled forward to earlier in the year to offset legal demand in export markets. AGCO's store to unit tractors sales of tractors and combines in the first quarter of 2009, were both down from the same period last year. For 2009 we expect continued weakness for tractors under 100- horsepower and lower demand for tractors over 100-horsepower. Industry tractor volumes were down approximately 8% in Europe in the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008. Tightened credit, especially in the markets of Eastern Europe and Russia contributed to the reduced demand in those areas. Retail tractors sales in Western Europe were mixed with growth in the larger markets of France and Germany being offset by weaker conditions in northern Europe and Spain. We expect reduce from income in 2009 to result in weaker industry demand in Western Europe and most significant market declines in Eastern Europe and Russia, resulting from credit limitations. South American industry volumes decreased approximately 19% during the first quarter of 2009 compared to 2008. Dry weather conditions, limited credit availability and political turmoil in Argentina all contributed to a decline of approximately 60% in Argentina tractor volumes. Total industry tractors sales in Brazil increased 3% in the first quarter of 2009. In Brazil, a new government-financing program is providing financing for small agricultural tractors. The inexpensive loans with interest rates as low as 2% in low farmers to borrow for up to 10 years. This program covers up to 24,000 tractors for 2011. In the first quarter of 2009, we estimate the sales of tractors under 80 horsepower at approximately 80%, while sales of tractors over 80-horsepower in Brazil declined approximately 55% compared to the first quarter of 2008. We expect 2009 South American industry volumes to be down significantly from 2008 record levels, due to the dry weather conditions and the impact of the tightened credit environment on planted acres and crop productions. Andy will now provide you with more details of our first quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin. Slide 6, details AGCO's regional net sales performance for the first quarter of 2009. The bar graph show our regional sales performance excluding the impact of currency translation. For the first quarter of 2009, currency translation had a negative impact of approximately 14.5%. If the current exchange rate hold, we are estimating the currency translation will reduce our 2009 sales by approximately 900 million to $1 billion. During the first quarter 2009, the Europe, Africa, Middle East segment had sales growth of approximately 9%, excluding the impact of currency compared to the first quarter 2008. Sales in the first quarter benefited from a strong order backlog, which declined steadily throughout the quarter. The growth in our EAME segment in the first quarter was led by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, as well as Africa. North American sales increased approximately 13% in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008, excluding currency translation impacts. Strong sales results in implements and hay tools contributed to the improvement. The order board for North America decline during the first quarter, as well. First quarter 2009 sales in South America declined approximately 27% from 2008, excluding currency translation impacts. Softer market demand in Argentina and a shift in mix to low or a horsepower tractors in Brazil, that Martin mentioned, drove most of the decrease. Sales in our Asia-Pacific segment decreased approximately 2% in the first quarter of 2009, compared to 2008 excluding the impact of currency. Part sales for the first quarter 2009 were $193.8 million, flat compared to the same period in 2008 after removing the impact of currency translation. Slide 7 highlights our sales and margin performance. AGCO's gross margins were down approximately 40 basis points in the first quarter of 2009, compared to the first quarter of 2008. Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of sales in South America created a drag on our margins. Operating margins were 3.7% in the first quarter 2009, compared to 5.3% in the first quarter of 2008. The decline in operating margins resulted from lower gross margins, higher engineering expenses and higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Operating income at our North America segments showed the largest improvement and was positive for the third consecutive quarter. Improved margin on our sprayer products and expense control initiatives contributed to the improvement. Operating margins and AGCO's Europe, Africa, Middle East region declined about 130 basis points. Lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focus on our high horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the lower margins. Declining market demand produced lower sales volumes and significantly lower operating margins in our South American business. The special financing program for small tractors in Brazil, that Martin mentioned, is causing a shift in the mix of products toward smaller, lower margin tractors. This change in product mix also contributed to the decline in the operating margins. Turning to Slide 8, which addresses working capital. Our 2008 year end inventory levels were higher than we had planned. We were impacted by a number of issues, including supplier constraints, limited credit in Eastern Europe and Russia and also softening demand. In the first quarter of 2009, seasonal increases raised our inventory above year-end levels and had remained above targeted levels. We are very focused on working down our inventory levels by adjusting our production schedules. Significant production cuts are planned for the second quarter of 2009 and our sales and earnings in the second quarter will be significantly impacted. We expect to see inventory declining during the second quarter and our June 30, 2009 inventories are expected to be below current levels. We also expect to end 2009 with inventory well below 2008 year-end levels. At the end of March 2009, our North America dealer-month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows; 5.5 months per tractors, 3.5 months for combines, and eight months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows; outstanding funding under accounts receivable securitization programs was approximately 477.5 million at March 31, 2009, compared to 497.8 in March 31, 2008. We have an uninterrupted access to fundings through our securitization facility today and have liquidity backups in place for these funding source, if needed. Wholesale interest-bearing receivables transferred to AGCO finance, our retail finance joint venture in North America as of March 31, 2009, was 66.9 million compared to approximately 76.5 million as of March, 31, 2008. Losses on sales receivables primarily under our securitization facilities, which is included in other expense net were $5 million for the first quarter of 2009, compared to 6.2 million for the same period in 2008. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operation less capital expenditures. Our seasonal demands for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby generate negative free cash flow in both the first quarter of 2009 and 2008. As we discussed on a previous slide, we're continuing to focus on reducing our working capital and expect our progress to generate cash flow in 2009. As Martin explained, we plan to invest more in 2009 for future growth. We expect to increase research and development and make additional investments in our plants in new products. Even after covering these increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting strong free cash flow this year. One last item about our liquidity, today AGCO Finance, our joint venture with Rabobank, provides financing for about 50% of AGCO's retail sales in our major markets. AGCO Finance is well capitalized, it does not rely on the commercial paper or securitization markets for its funding and is currently increasing its participation in financing or retail sales, as other credits sources tightened. Slide 10 focuses on the assumptions underlying our current 2009 outlook. I want to stress that with the global recession, tightened credit market and volatile commodity prices, there continues to be considerable uncertainty around the market conditions we will face this year. You can see from the slide that our outlook for 2009 anticipates declines in all the global market. Some other specific assumptions include; the strengthening dollar and its impact on translation of our sales outside of the U.S. are expected to pressure our sales by approximately 11%, our 2009 forecast assumes pricing increases of approximately 4% on a consolidated basis. In 2009, AGCO will continue to invest for future growth, including increase in both capital expenditures and research and development. And finally on January 1, 2009, AGCO adopted FSP APB 14-1, the implementation of this new accounting rule resulted in approximately $3.7 million of additional non-cash interest expense related to our convertible notes in the first quarter of 2009. Prior year interest expense was also restated to include $3.5 million of additional interest expense. We will pose restated quarterly financial statements for 2008 on our website when we file our 10-Q for the first quarter. In the meantime, feel free to contact Greg for additional detail. For the full year, this accounting rule's expected result, at approximately $15 million of additional non- cash interest expense. Our effective tax rate was approximately 36% for the first quarter of 2009. We're targeting low to mid 30% percentage rate range, again for the full year 2009 for our effective tax rate. Turning to the next Slide, despite the level of uncertainty in the markets, we want to continue to provide you with visibility into our business. Slide 11 lists our view of selected 2009 financial goals. We are projecting 2009 sales to range from 6.7 billion to $7 billion. While our 2009 results are important to us, we're also very focused on AGCO's long-term profitability and we will invest on increased engineering and capital expenditures this year. With that long-term focus and the uncertainty that surrounds the market demand in mind, our forecast for 2009 diluted earnings per share ranges from $2 to $2.50 per share. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the 275 to $300 million range and free cash flow in the 150 to $200 million range, after funding the expected increases in capital. For the second quarter of 2009, we expect sales declines of 30 to 35% compared to the second quarter 2008 due to reduced production, the negative impacts of currency translation and softer market demand. Lower volumes in production, increased engineering expenses and the negative impacts of currency translation keeps second quarter 2009 earnings per share below half of the level of the second quarter of 2008. That concludes our prepared remarks, Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division My first question is around your outlook for free cash flow. You haven't changed that from last quarter. If you look at free cash in Q1, I'm assuming that it was significantly below your expectation. Can you talk a little bit about how you expect to generate the same level of free cash flow given all the changes in your outlook on that P&L? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Sure Ann, certainly, we didn't -- we wanted to show that we can still generate the cash flow that we had in our previous forecast. That will be a significant amount of work during the year to bring our working capital levels down. As you can see, what happened in the first quarter, we had a use of cash, most of that was the reduction in our accounts payable and also because of seasonal requirements. As usual, our inventories and accounts receivable went up, as well. So we're in a situation now, where we're cutting production over the course of the rest of the year with significant cuts in the second quarter in order to start to reduce that inventory level from where it is today. We hope that our payable levels stayed fairly consistent now and our objective will be reducing inventories and accounts receivable throughout the rest of the year and with that, we hope that our net working capital reduction will be about close to $100 million by the end of the year. That's our target and that should put us in line to generate the cash flow that we have targeted, as well. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And along those very lines, can you talk a little bit about what you would anticipate decremental margins to be around the different regions as you cut production rather rapidly and quickly in South America and probably in Europe also. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Well, we are projecting that our margins in Europe and South America will be down throughout the rest of the year and for the full year. In North America, we're projecting that our margins improved and that's because some of the cost reduction initiatives that we started last year, that market is, although, we're seeing it's down, we hope to perform well there and we are getting some benefit to currency in North America, as well. But in Europe, that's mainly the reduction in our production volumes. We'll reduce their margins, probably over 100, 150 basis points and then in South America, we're looking for more substantial reductions in our operating margins more like 300, to 350 basis points. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And just for a quick clarification, I know you gave us your outlook for the revenue impact from currency. What's your anticipated earnings impact from currency? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Currency impacts our first quarter by about $0.10 and we're looking forward to impact our full year results by somewhere probably between 35 to $0.45. We, obviously, are getting the impact of the translation, which is a negative impact. But there is a partial offset higher margins that we all see from the importing goods out back into the U.S. and some of the dollar sales that we have in South America, as well. But that's not to the same extent as our translation impact. Ann P. Duignan JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division And just the $0.10 was a negative? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, they're all negative. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn with UBS. Henry Kirn UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Could you give a little more detail on what you're doing for cost reductions? And maybe some sense of the tailwinds that you expect on an ongoing basis as you get the reductions up. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, we have a major portfolio of cost reduction initiatives we work on. We started to do that already 2005 and overall it's like one third is completed, another third is in the pipeline and the third is actually not yet started. So that means we have a pretty healthy portfolio on productivity improvement. It is going into core process, redesign in some of our factories. We changed the build-to-order approach in other factories, so that means we have plenty of different actions and activities we work on. Henry Kirn UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And is it possible to talk a little bit about the credit profile of your customers globally? Maybe a sense of where delinquencies are in the AGCO Finance business and what we should be looking for, there? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes. In the AGCO Finance business, which would be the credit environment for our end customer, we're seeing still very low delinquencies in our established markets of North America, Western Europe, those delinquency levels are fine. I think in most cases farmers are still very profitable in these markets and so we're not seeing any major changes or issues there. We have an ongoing issue in Brazil that we talked about many times, where the portfolio in Brazil, there's been numerous government-sponsored delays or deferrals of the payments due. And so we have a little more cloudy picture in Brazil in terms of where our credit situation is. Delinquencies are significantly higher in Brazil, but some of that is due to the fact that there is a number of these delayed -- payment delays being considered and farmers continue to wait to see what's going to happen with those before they make their payments. So again, we're monitoring that situation closely in Brazil and continue to hope that there is going to be a strong resolution to that, so we can get portfolio back in shape there. When you look at our dealers, it depends on the market. We have a situation in Eastern Europe and in Russia, where our dealers or distributors are probably carrying too much inventory. The market has declined significantly and so we're obviously working with those distributors in those markets. And our markets in Western Europe and North America, I would not say that there is any real significant change in the credit. Certainly dealers and some of our markets in Europe are carrying a little more inventory than they'd like. We've seen our order boards come down and in some cases, we're holding back further shipments until we see that inventory clear. But in most cases, I think we're in pretty good shape with our distributor network. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Morgan Stanley. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division I had two questions, I guess on the EAME, the first would be, have you already seen the slowdown in Eastern Europe and Russia in the first quarter? And is there an appetite to buy if there were more credit available or is it really a lack of confidence or economic issue? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO The slowdown in Russia and some of the countries of the former Russian Federation already started last quarter 2008. So that means we saw it already last year. And the market, basically, over in December, January was almost down to zero. There's a big demand for agricultural equipment, so that means in theory, everybody would like to buy. The problem is retail finance. So that means my impression is that as soon as local governments decide on programs, the market could turn around very quickly. There have been talks between the industry leaders in Russia last month, so I think that something could happen, but actually we are more on the conservative and safe side. We don't want to deal with assumptions that could be proven to be too optimistic. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division If things did get better on the financing front, would that be a next-year issue or is there mechanically thinking things moves fast enough to help this year? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO It depends pretty much on the products so that means, if it would affect combine harvesters, most probably it would be a little late. As far as tractor, this is our concern that could also help this year. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division And there's been some news on tariffs and such on imported tractors into combines into Russia. Can you explain just mechanically, what products these things apply to and whether it applies to inventory already sitting there that's not been sold, maybe just give us a recap of the mechanics of that? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Right now, the tariff is on combines and it would be on anything that's now imported. It wouldn't have been on anything that's already been imported or sitting on the ground, in the market. And so right now it's just on the combines. Robert Cameron Wertheimer Morgan Stanley, Research Division But is there any move to put it on other products or… Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO In theory, if they would be successful, one could think about other products. I don't think so, most probably, I see a pretty good chance that they discontinue the taxes on combines, because they had it already some years ago. It failed because combines did find their way through other neighboring countries into Russia. And so therefore, I think this kind of protectionism actually never works and it will not work in Russia, I'm sure. So therefore, I'm not very confident that this will go on forever like this. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies & Company. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division I wanted to follow up a little bit on North America and the margins there were a little bit better than what I was expecting. And I guess you're saying that they should even get a little bit better from here. How much of that, Andy, is due to the import issues with currency and so forth and how much is, kind of, core North American production, do you think? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO In terms of the improvement in North America for currency, probably about four or five million of the improvement would've been relating to currency. The rest was operational improvement. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division I guess, I would've expected the tax rate to be a little lower, given profitability in North America, is there anything, I mean, historically, I sort of think of those profits kind of dropping pretty much straight to the bottom line. Is there anything that's changed with respect to that? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO That's still the right concept. I think the only offset was, that we did have a lower income in South America, which carries lower than our, kind of, average tax rate, as well. So that pulled it back up from what you would have seen on the North America site. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division And then maybe from Martin, can you talk a little bit about -- it seems like the high horsepower equipment in the U.S, in Europe, the commentary was actually pretty good with respect to what you're saying in sales. And yet you seem somewhat cautious going forward. Have you actually seen cancellations in your order book? Or something that has developed there? Or are you, kind of, being conservative with respect to just economic condition? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, actually I think our focus on the professional farms and the product needed by professional farmers is the right strategy. So that means those products not only have higher margins but also the entry barriers are higher. And the farmers act more like investors, so that means those market in general have a much better stability than other markets. So we launched a full range of new products for the market here in North America and just start to sell. We have more internal problems to get the product delivered on time and only very few cancellations globally. So that means this market is pretty stable and those cancellations are not higher than, for example, also last year. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division It sounds like the weakness that your forecasting going forward, I don't want to put words in your mouth but it sounds like that's more in the non U.S., non-European and the lower horsepower? You put that back... Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Yes, it's in what we call lifestyle, in the lifestyle segment. So the smaller load tractors and it's basically than in the countries we talked about, Eastern Europe and South America. Stephen Edward Volkmann Jefferies LLC, Research Division Maybe last, but one real quick, an update on Challenger®, how are we looking for, sort of, revenue and profitability there? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Challenger® is improving, but we just need to check on the numbers, Andy, do you have something? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes. Challenger® sales were down about 10% on a global basis in the first quarter. But the income level was just slightly down from last year. So really pretty consistent with the overall results of the company. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO And Challenger® is our main partner in Russia, so that actually, the system more than other brands. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs. Frederick Curtis Darling Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Andy, I wonder if you can show us what happened with price in the quarter? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Sure, pricing in the quarter was up about 4.5% and as we said on the remarks, we have expected it to be about four for the full year. Frederick Curtis Darling Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay and that's just comps, or do you see things getting weaker in certain product categories or is that just mix or what accounts for the degradation on a full year? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO It's mainly comps, yes. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO And we don't intend to buy market sale by pricing. So we do what we said and so we will be pretty stable, I think. Frederick Curtis Darling Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division And then also on engineering expense, which would be expecting there for the year, I think you bet 3% of sales versus 2.3% last year? Is that a good run rate going forward and when would you expect that to tail back down? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO At about 200 million. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, that's about the right run rate. Frederick Curtis Darling Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay and does that continue into 2010 or is it just getting through the Tier 4 comp here? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO No, I think it's pretty much a run rate, so that means, we try to use those times in order to be prepared for the future. And I would assume that they stay pretty much on that level for the years to come. Frederick Curtis Darling Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Actually, Martin, can you share your thoughts on timing of a recovery here, is it solely tied to the macro or do you think that you're going to see some shift in the political landscape that can accelerate things? How do you factor into the equation your pretty strong purchases by farmers over the last couple of years and some potential that, it takes a little bit longer to turn equipment demand relative to farmer income as we move into 2010, 2011. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO As you can imagine, if you're going to read the future, it's much more difficult than ever before. But my impression is -- what I'm always saying is that the fundamentals didn't change. So and you can talk to people like Monsanto, other guys, who are now, our industry, they're pretty much saying the same, the world population is growing as fast as we saw before. Our renewable fuels is still mid-up, changing diets, still middle, so there's actually nothing that really changed. And therefore, I think our industry will be much better off than other industries and therefore, I also hope that we will recover faster than other industries. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Casey with Wachovia Securities. Andrew Millard Casey Wachovia Securities, LLC, Research Division Question on EAME in the quarter, the sales were up 8.7% x currency, while the regional market comments indicate, in broad terms, weaker European, in Middle East with higher African demand. Is it right to think about half of the 8.7 is price and the rest is a combination of positive mix in inventory bill budget? Can you talk about, in the distribution channel? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I don't have the split but certainly, yes, in terms of the pricing, you're right. And then what we had was a fairly strong order board at the end of the year and filling those orders through shipments into our distribution and through the retail channel occurred in the first quarter. Now as we get to the second quarter, we cut production and we'll expect to see our sales come down fairly significantly in the second quarter in that region. As we adjust inventory levels and as you mentioned as well, we'll see our distributors reduce their inventory levels, somewhat in the second quarter, as well. Andrew Millard Casey Wachovia Securities, LLC, Research Division Lastly, can you comment on what happened in the input costs on a year-over-year basis during the quarter? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO We were -- we saw some improvement there, but pricing offset the carryover impact of the higher costs from last year. So in terms of looking at where our pricing was and relative to our input cost, we didn't lose any ground. Let's say, we're fairly neutral and what we project going forward is that we're seeing obviously, reductions in input cost, we're seeing reductions in steel prices. And that should start to show better benefit in the second half of the year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Rentschler with Wall Street access. Charlie Rentschler Wall Street Access In view of your rising capital expenditures, could you give us a little bit of detail, Martin, maybe rattle off the top two or three biggest projects that you're undertaking currently? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO In engineering? Charlie Rentschler Wall Street Access With capital expenditures. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well, it's pretty much the same. A lot goes into Tier 4. And then the second big portion goes into capacity and the renovation and new factories in Fendt, Germany. Charlie Rentschler Wall Street Access And Andy, can you take a stab at where you think net debt will be at the end of the year? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Sure. I think at the end of the year, we're looking at cash levels of, hopefully, over $700 million and the debt level should be the same as where they are right now. So in the $600 million range. So net debt at zero or below. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO So we are much better than most of your companies. Charlie Rentschler Wall Street Access And thank, God, you haven't been buying your stock back? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Yes, you told us not to do that. Right? Operator Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Merrill Lynch. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Could you just provide a little bit more color as to, what is happening with, not necessarily your customers' access to credit, but your dealers' access to credit and current environment and how AGCO is helping dealers to relieve whatever problems they have? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Well actually, I think that most of our dealers also had some pretty good years and deleverage their businesses, as well. Overall, I think we do not have too many dealers talking about problems, or having restrictions, Andy, I don't know how you see it. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I think that's pretty much right. I mean from -- really, the key for our distribution is financing their the inventory they want to carry and certainly we're encouraging our dealers to reduce their inventory levels, turn their inventory faster. We have more, we're taking more retail orders and building to retail order and that allows us to reduce our inventory levels, as well as our dealers. And so we're trying to take actions like that to help work with our dealer network. In terms of the credit, obviously, we provide certain amounts of the credit to our distribution in terms of, for plant lines and terms conditions. And we're maintaining those and certainly working with our network. As I mentioned earlier, we are holding some of those shipments until their fleets get moved back down, as well in certain circumstances. But I don't believe any of our dealers are in financial problems or anything like that, as Martin mentioned. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Do you think dealers are encouraged to carry lower levels of inventory because the cost of short-term financing has gone up? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO We work with them in this direction anyhow because we do not think that it makes dealers very strong to have plenty of inventory. So therefore, most probably, our dealers already, last year were leaner than others. Andrew Burris Obin BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And in so far as you mentioned that you are working with dealers to reduce their inventory, when do you think production and inventory in the channel, sort of, balance each other? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO I think we'll be working through this, throughout the course of the year again. We're taking the biggest adjustment here in the second quarter. But we would expect to be below for the third and fourth quarter as well. That's more typical, particularly always in the fourth quarter, we're producing below retail as our working capital comes back down out of the -- off of the selling seasons. And so that's kind of a normal occurrence. Operator Your next question comes from Barry Bannister with Stifel Nicolaus. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division The history of the company is that you generate most of your free cash flow in the fourth quarter, in fact 84 to 94% of full-year free cash flow the past three years has occurred in the fourth quarter. And the first quarter has always been a loss. But it was a bigger one than I expected, in terms of operating cash flow and bled off most of your cash, so is it safe to assume that if volumes disappoint in the back half, you're still targeting a mid-single-digit working capital ratio? And that you'll cut production further just to keep that cash flow goal? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Yes, that's a fair assumption. Obviously, the later in the year that you're not hitting your targets, the more difficult it is. And that's the challenge we have. But that -- we are focused on trying to get our inventories and working capital, as we remain in line with our sales levels. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division In South America, particularly Brazil. Would you discuss on the Rabobank JV, what portion of the retail receivables are currently under this rate-deferred payment structure and in dollar terms, as well as percent of the portfolio? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Barry, I'm not sure I have all that detail in front of me. We have our portfolio in Brazil, it's about $1 billion or so. Again, I don't have the percentages. A fairly large significant portion of that has been under some sort of deferral or another during the last few years. We're certainly getting payments through those, but there are some of those that have been deferred and we've taken action in terms of increasing our loan- loss reserves to reflect any reduction in the collateral base that we have on those loans. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division In the first hour and a half of trading on the 24th, Friday, the stock rose about 10% and has since given back a lot of those gains, but there was a rumor of a merger or a takeover by Deere of AGCO. Two years ago it was C&H, three or four years ago it was CAT®. These are very distracting for analysts. Would Martin be willing to squelch those rumors? Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO First of all, Wall Street shouldn't generate those rumors, they were not generated by us. I heard about it, not earlier than you, and we don't comment on those rumors at all. So I'm not aware on rumor about C&H. I think the C&H rumor was the other direction. I'm aware on the rumor about CAT® some years ago. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division And then lastly, the tax rate in '09, did you say what it would likely be on your budget? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO It's somewhere in the low to mid-30% range. Barry Bernard Bannister Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division That's book and cash tax? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Cash tax would probably be a little lower than that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Jamie Lyn Cook Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division One, can you guys give your backlog by region or in total? My follow-up question on the pricing, for I was surprised, you kept pricing the same given, or lowered it modestly, given the dramatic decline you're seeing in the markets. Are you guys seeing any more aggressive pricing on the larger commercial deals? Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO In terms of pricing, it's been pretty much as expected. We haven't seen any significant changes or big discounting going on in the market. Let's say pricing is the toughest in South America right now. But everything seems to be holding so far and we're hopeful it remains that way. In terms of our orders, our orders overall or about order book look at the end of March, is about half of what it was a year ago and about a quarter down from the end of the year. So we've been seeing our order book come down. It's off of a extremely high levels. Remember when we talked last year, how strong our order boards were and so they're getting down to levels that we've seen before. But have been declining in the first quarter. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Also you have, I think you understand that a lot of the sales decline is caused by exchange rates. So the pressure in core markets like Europe and North America is not really big because those markets hold up pretty well. Operator Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions and answers. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Peterson for any concluding remarks. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Once again, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in AGCO and I encourage you, if you have additional questions, to follow up with me. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator This does conclude AGCO Corporation's 2009 First Quarter Earnings Call. You may now disconnect."
3,GV_025180_2010Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Shaira, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2010 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Gregory Peterson. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Shaira. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AGCO's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will refer to a slide presentation, which is posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We will make forward-looking statements including some related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market demand and conditions, margin and productivity improvements, inventory management, working capital, exchange rates, production volumes, general economic condition, pricing increases, capital expenditures, pension and benefit, planned costs and engineering. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. We started 2010 with contrasting regional trends. The growth in Brazil was stronger than expected, while North American market was stable. And the market in Europe continue to weaken relative to last year. During the quarter, we closely managed the seasonal build of our inventories by slowing production schedules and putting some factories on temporary shutdown. Our significant production cuts in Europe and North America negatively impacted our first quarter sales and margins. This controlled production in the first quarter positions us to improve our performance in the second half of 2010. Slide 3 shows AGCO's financial results for the first quarter of 2010. Our first quarter sales were down by approximately 13% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of currency sales, we are 22% below last year. In the first quarter of 2010, sales decline, slower production volumes, a weaker mix of products and high engineering expenses all contributed to the drop in our earnings. Our production volumes for 2009 and projected volumes for 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. First quarter 2010 tractor and combine production levels were down 20% compared to the first quarter of 2009, with significantly higher production in South America, offset by heavy production cuts in both our North American and European factories. This reduction helped us to manage the seasonal build in our inventory and our dealers' inventory in the first quarter of 2010. This trend will continue in the second quarter with the exception that our overall production levels are expected to be above the levels of the second quarter of 2009. As a result of lower production rates in the first quarter of 2010, our order boards have improved across all markets from year-end 2009 levels. At the end of March, the backlogs in Europe and North America are up over 30% from December 2009 levels but remained below the first quarter of 2009. In South America, the order board is up from both first quarter 2009 level and year-end 2009 levels. For the full year of 2010, we are expecting tractor and combine production to be about flat to slightly up compared to 2009 levels. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first quarter of 2010. Industry tractor sales in North America were up only slightly compared to first quarter 2009 levels. Compact tractor category, which is tied more closely to the general economy was up 4% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. The high horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economies and increased 14% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Declines in Utility Tractor sales offset growth in the other segments. The combine market grew by about 1% during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the strong levels seen in 2009. AGCO's total unit sales of tractors and combines in the first quarter of 2010 were both down from 2009 levels. Industry unit retail sales in Western Europe weakened further in the first quarter. Industry sales were down 23% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Slower recovery of the general economy, weaker farmer sentiment and lower farm income in 2009 all contributed to the decline. Demand was softest in France, Germany, Scandinavia and Finland. South American industry retail tractor volumes increased approximately 53% during the first quarter of 2010 compared to the relatively weak first quarter of 2009. Strong crop production Brazil and attractive financing programs provided by the government contributed to strong market demand. Better harvest in Argentina and improved creditability resulted in market growth of 37% compared to the drought-impacted volumes in the first quarter of 2009. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, provide you more information on our first quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a look at our regional businesses. AGCO's regional net sales performance for 2010 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 9% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2010, the Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales decline of approximately 37%, excluding the impact of currency, compared to the first quarter of 2009. The most significant declines occurred in France and Germany. Sales and production were significantly lower in 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009, due to soft retail market conditions. In contrast, our 2009 sales benefited from large opening order boards in the first quarter of 2009, which were carried over from the strong markets in 2008. North American net sales were down approximately 31% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Destocking initiatives and softer end market demand in the Dairy and Cattle Producers segments contributed to the decline. Hay tools, mid-range tractors and implement showed the most weakness. AGCO's first quarter 2010 net sales in South America increased to approximately 68% from '09 levels, excluding currency. In Brazil, strong harvest, stable commodity prices and low-interest rate, government- sponsored financing programs resulted in strong industry sales. Better growing conditions and improved credit availability contributed to the improved results in Argentina. Net sales on our Rest of the World segment declined approximately 14% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 2009, excluding currency. Lower sales in Australia and New Zealand contributed to the decline. Parts sales were $207.3 million for the first quarter of 2010, which was a decline of approximately 1% for the quarter compared to the same period in 2009, excluding currency. Slide 7 reviews AGCO's sales and margin performance. Gross margins were down approximately 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. Lower production volumes in North America and in Europe were partially offset by margin improvements in South America. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region declined significantly for the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Weaker sales, lower production volumes, sales mix and increased engineering and SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted in lower operating margins. In South America region, operating margins rebounded to 11.3%, an increase of over 800 basis points for the first quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. Robust market demand in Brazil and improved conditions in Argentina produced higher sales in both countries. Increased production and the shift in mix of products towards larger high-horsepower, higher-margin tractors also contributed to the improvement. Sales of tractors, combines and implements were all up sharply. In the first quarter of 2010, operating income declined in North America due to the significant drop in sales, production cuts and dealer destocking. Weak demand from dairy and livestock producers resulted in significantly lower sales of our hay equipment and mid-range tractors. Margins for the full year are expected to improve in 2010 compared to 2009. Higher levels of sales and production in the second half of 2010 in both North America and Europe, stronger full year margins in South America and our global cost- reduction efforts are expected to drive the expected margin improvement. Moving to Slide 8. Every year, our operating plan includes a build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring selling season, and Slide 8 provides visibility into our inventory management in the first quarter. You can see that the seasonal build from the year-end 2009 inventory level to the end of the first quarter of 2010 was much more controlled than in the previous two years. As Martin mentioned, we idled plants in the first quarter of 2010 to adjust our inventory levels for projected retail demand in the coming quarters. The controlled production schedule pressured our results in Europe and North America during the first quarter of 2010, but it positions us for better performance in the second half of 2010. At the end of March 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower in all categories and at the same time a year ago. We still have work to do especially in the area of hay equipment. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors were at 4.5 months, two months for combines and seven months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: On January 1, 2010, the company adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-16. And as a result of this adoption of the new accounting rule, the company's European securitization facilities were required to be recognized within the company's consolidated balance sheets. At March 31, 2010, the company's accounts receivable securitization facilities in Europe had outstanding funding of approximately $138 million. The company recognized approximately $138 million of accounts receivable sold through its European securitization facilities with a corresponding liability equivalent to the funded balance of the facilities. Losses on sales of receivables primarily under our securitization facilities, which is included in other expense net, was approximately $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2010 compared to $5 million during the first quarter of 2009. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. AGCO's use of cash in the first quarter of 2010 was $226 million compared to over $500 million in the first quarter of 2009. As a result, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the first quarter is significantly better than at this point a year ago. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in a $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Slide 10 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. We slowed the investments, some of our plant productivity projects and new products last year in response to softening market conditions. In 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China and in Russia. Slide 11 shifts our focus to the assumptions underlying our 2010 outlook. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for our industry and our business. Our strategies are aimed at helping AGCO grow profitably in this environment. Our latest outlook for 2010 anticipates declines in the Western European and North American markets and growth in South America. Our 2010 forecast assumes pricing increases of approximately 2% on a consolidated basis. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expenses by approximately 20% or $40 million. We also look for our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. The impact of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans is expected to increase expenses by approximately $8 million. Slide 12 lists our view of selected 2010 financial goals. We are projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion, a small increase from 2009. We expect forecasted pricing benefits and market share improvements to provide some lift despite relatively flat market demand. Our forecast for 2010 diluted earnings per share ranges from $1.65 to $1.75. We expect gross margin improvements to be offset by higher engineering and pension costs. In the second quarter of 2010, we expect sales to be flat compared to the second quarter of 2009. A higher effective tax rate and increased engineering and other project expenses will keep second quarter 2010 earnings per share below the level of the second quarter last year, with a range of $0.40 to $0.45. These earnings per share projections exclude restructuring expenses expected to be incurred in the company's European operations, estimated at approximately $0.10 per share for the full year of 2010. That concludes our prepared remarks, operator. We're now ready to open the call for questions."
4,GV_025180_2011Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Mische, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2011 First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, April 26. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Greg Peterson. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Mische, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. We will refer to a slide presentation that can be found on our website, which is located at  The non-GAAP measures used in this slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We will make forward-looking statements this morning including those related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market conditions, margin improvements, profitability, the effect of acquisitions, new product development and market expansion, factory productivity, production, investments in expanding markets, free cash flow, depreciation, emission requirements, product line expansion and general economic conditions. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning. AGCO's momentum continued in the first quarter. After our solid finish to 2010, we started 2011 with the strongest first quarter in our history. Recall that last year in the first quarter, we managed 2 weaker markets in the U.S. and Western Europe, and we were focused on inventory reduction. This year, we operated our factories at normal seasonal rates during the first quarter. Market demands strengthened in Western Europe, and we took advantage of robust market conditions in Europe and North America and posted first quarter sales close of nearly 32% on a constant-currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2010. First quarter operating margins in our Europe/Africa/Middle East region rebounded to 8.9%. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continued to be outstanding, and the market demand for large equipment remains robust. We capitalized on industry conditions and wholesale in North America, 25% compared to the first quarter of 2010, excluding the impact of currency translation. North American operating margins expanded over 600 basis points in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of $0.81 exceeded our guidance due to stronger than anticipated market conditions and better performance on operating margin. In the next few quarters, we will be increasing our investments in new product development and market expansions, limiting our margin improvement. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and projected volumes for 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. AGCO's first quarter 2011 tractor and combine production was up 17% compared to the first quarter of 2010. Improving order flow, along with increased production levels in our European and North American factories, were offset by lower production volume in South America. AGCO's order board for the EAME market at the end of March 2011 has more than doubled, compared to end of March 2010. Equipment order boards in North America were also up significantly from March 2010 levels. South American order boards remain strong, but were down from very high levels at the end of the first quarter of 2010. In 2011, we expect production volumes to be up in the first half of the year compared to 2010 and flat in the second half of the year, with higher production in Europe and lower in South America. For the full year of 2011, we expect production to be up 5% to 10% from 2010 levels. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first quarter of 2011. Industry tractor sales in North America were up modestly compared to 2010 levels. In North America, industry sales of compact and utility tractors both increased due to improvement in the general economy and the dairy and livestock sector. High-horsepower tractors declined nearly 8% compared to the strong levels in the first quarter of 2010. The combine market benefited from favorable row crop economy and increased 37% during the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year. Industry unit retail sales in Western Europe were up approximately 18% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the weak level of the first quarter of 2010. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the dairy and livestock sector contributed to the growth. Industry growth was strongest in Germany, France, Scandinavia and Finland. South American industry retail tractor volumes increased modestly during the first quarter of 2011 compared to strong levels in the first quarter of 2010. Eco farm [ph] fundamentals produced growth in Argentina and other South American countries, offsetting weaker sales in Brazil. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our first quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the first quarter of 2011 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 3.3% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the first quarter of 2011. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 51%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010. Sales increased in nearly every major market across Europe in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2010. The most significant improvements occurred in Germany, France and Scandinavia. North American net sales increased approximately 25%, excluding currency translation impacts, during the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Sales of combines and hay products showed the most improvement in the first quarter compared to last year. AGCO's first quarter 2011 net sales in South America increased approximately 1% from comparable 2010 levels, excluding currency translation. AGCO's first quarter sales in Argentina increased compared to the first quarter of 2010. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to the market strength in Argentina. Softer market conditions in Brazil in the first quarter of 2011 offset most of the growth in Argentina. Net sales in our Rest of the World segment increased approximately 70% in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 2010, excluding the impact of currency. Sales growth in Eastern Europe and Russia produced most of the increase. Part sales were $272 million for the first quarter of 2011, an increase of approximately 29% for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2010, excluding currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Operating margins were up over 500 basis points in the first quarter 2011 compared to the first quarter 2010. The benefit of increased production volumes and the leverage over our operating expenses resulted in the improvement. As Martin mentioned earlier, first quarter 2011 operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region were 8.9%, up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Margins were improved in the first quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher sales and production volume and a richer mix of products. In the South America region, operating margins declined in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 2010. A weaker geographic mix and lower levels of production and higher expenses contributed to the decline. In the first quarter of 2011, operating margins improved significantly in North America, also due to higher sales and production. Slide 8 looks at North American profitability in more detail. Margins in this region have been 1 of our main focus areas for the last few years. You can see from the graph on this slide that we have made progress. In the first quarter of 2011, margins improved 700 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2010 on relatively flat sales. We introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics cost and improved the efficiency of our factories. First quarter 2011 operating margins also benefited from higher levels of production and improved leverage over operating costs compared to the first quarter of 2010. We realized that we have more work to do and target additional margin improvement in 2011. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. AGCO's use of cash in the first quarter of 2011 were $204 million compared to $226 million in the first quarter of 2010. Despite a larger build of inventory to support our projected sales growth, our use of cash is slightly better than this point a year ago. We plan to continue to invest for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow of over $100 million during 2011. At the end of March 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was higher than the same period, the same time a year ago in preparation for forecasted growth in 2011. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors were not 5.9 months, 4 months for combine and 8 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: losses on sales of receivables, which is included in both interest expense net and other expense net, were approximately $3.6 million during the first quarter of 2011 compared to $3.4 million in the same period of 2010. Moving on to Slide 10, it looks that if we look at our depreciation and capital expenditure trend. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity in Germany and make investments in China and Russia. Our revised outlook for 2010 -- or 2011, excuse me, for our regional market is captured on Slide 11. We anticipate modest growth in North America, as the strong financial position of row crop farmers and the expectation of farm income above historical averages is expected to support strong demand. We expect the South American market to remain strong, but be down 5% to 10%. Higher crop prices for grain and dairy farmers in Western Europe and improving farmer sentiment are expected to generate market growth of about 15% compared to the weak levels experienced in 2010. Slide 12 lists our view of selected 2011 financial goals. We are projecting 2011 sales to range between $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvement, the positive impact of currency translation and acquisition impacts are all expected to contribute to the growth. Including significant investments in product development and market development, we expect 2011 earnings to be improved from 2010 levels. Our target for 2011 earnings per share ranges from $3.50 to $3.75 per share. We expect to increase capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $300 million range, and our free cash flow to remain positive and exceed $100 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. Operator, that concludes our remarks. We are now ready to take questions."
5,GV_025180_2012Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2012 Q1 Earnings Release and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Greg Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Sarah, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We will refer to a slide presentation this morning, which we posted on our website at  The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of our presentation. We'll make forward-looking statements this morning, including statements that are not historical fact, including the projections of earnings per share, sales, free cash flow, market conditions, farmer income, harvests, weather, market share, margin improvements, production levels, new product development, factory productivity, investments in facilities and expanding markets, government financing programs, industry demand, impacts of foreign currency, general economic conditions, depreciation, emission requirements, pricing benefits, plant shutdowns, engineering expenses, startup and market support costs, capital expenditures and the impact of the GSI acquisition. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including a company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. Now on the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's momentum continued in the first quarter of 2012. With a strongest first quarter in our history, we capitalized on improved demand in key Western European markets and continued market strength in North America while executing against our important margin improvement initiatives. First quarter operating margins in our Europe/Africa/Middle East region increased to 11.3%. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continue to be outstanding, and the market demand for large equipment remains very strong. Including the benefit of the GSI acquisition, AGCO's sales in North America grew by approximately 59% compared to the first quarter of 2011, excluding the unfavorable impact of currency translation. North America operating margins expanded over 500 basis points in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the first quarter of 2012. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2012 of $1.21 exceeded our guidance due to better-than-anticipated market conditions and better performance of operating margins. In the next few quarters, we plan to increase our investments in new product development and facility and market expansion. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2011 and projected volumes for 2012 are illustrated on Slide 4. AGCO's first quarter 2012 production was up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2011. Strong order books with increased production levels in our European and North American factories were offset by lower production volumes in South America. First quarter demand in South America was adversely impacted by the dry conditions in Southern Brazil and Argentina, and our production was reduced accordingly. Our European production benefited from the pull forward of farm production into the first quarter. The farm production schedule in 2012 is more heavily weighted to both the first and second quarters. We expect to have lower production at our plant in Germany during the third quarter to facilitate the transition of our brand new assembly facility in Marktoberdorf. AGCO's order book is up between 10% and 25% across all regions at the end of March 2012 compared to March 2011 levels. In 2012, we expect production volumes to be up for the remainder of the year, with higher production in Europe and North America. For the full year of 2012, we expect production to be up 10% to 12% from 2011 levels. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first quarter of 2012. Industry tractor sales in North America were up modestly compared to 2011 levels. In North America, industry sales of high horsepower and utility tractors both increased due to continued positive conditions for row crop farmers and improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors. The combined market was down significantly compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to the timing of industry production and due to very high levels of demand seen last year. We expect full year industry combine demand to be down modestly compared to 2011. Industry unit retail sales of tractors in Western Europe were up approximately 1% in the first quarter of 2012. Strong growth in the key markets of France, United Kingdom and Germany was partially offset by declines in Italy and Spain. South American industry retail tractor volumes declined modestly during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. Dry weather impacted the first harvest in southern Brazil and Argentina, and industry demand was negatively impacted. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our first quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the first quarter 2012 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of about 4% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the first quarter of 2012. Acquisitions, primarily the GSI acquisition, added approximately 11% to net sales in the first quarter 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 29%, excluding the impact of currency translation, during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011. Growth was highest in Germany, France and the United Kingdom and was partially offset by sales declines in some other -- some of Southern European markets. The accelerated production dealer shipments in Germany that Martin referenced earlier contributed to the increase. North America net sales increased approximately 59%, excluding currency translation impacts, during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Organic growth was approximately 27% after excluding acquisition impacts. Sales improved significantly across all major product categories in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2011. AGCO's first quarter net sales in South America grew 7% from comparable 2011 levels, excluding currency translation. Acquisitions generated nearly all of the growth. Organic sales were impacted by drought conditions in Southern Brazil and in Argentina. Net sales in our Asia/Pacific segment increased approximately 24% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, excluding the impact of currency and the benefit of acquisitions. Sales growth across Asia produced most of the organic increase. Part sales were $304 million for the first quarter of 2012, an increase of approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2011, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Adjusted operating margins were about 140 basis points in the first quarter of 2012, better compared to the first quarter of 2011. The benefit of increased production volumes and pricing was partially offset by increased material costs and higher engineering and marketing expenses. Operating margins in the first quarter of 2012 were highest in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region where they surpassed 11%. Margins improved nearly 300 basis points in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to higher sales and production volumes, combined with cost controls and a favorable mix associated with the accelerated Fendt production. In the first quarter of 2012, operating margins in North America, excluding acquisition impact, exceeded 7% due to higher sales and production, a favorable sales mix and cost-control initiatives. Including the benefit of GSI, North American operating margins reached 8.9%. In South America region, operating margins were 5.8% in the first quarter of 2012. Margins were lower compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to expenses associated with acquisition and increased engineering and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions. GSI performed well in its first full quarter as part of AGCO. Slide 8 details GSI's sales by region and by product for the first quarter of 2012. GSI sales grew over 10% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same period last year. Sales grew across all regions, with the strongest growth in Asia. GSI contributed $0.09 of EPS in the first quarter, and we are still expecting approximately $0.45 of accretion for the full year of 2012. Slide 9 provides visibility into working capital management over the last few years. Every year, our first quarter operating plan includes a build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring selling season. The inventory build in the first quarter of 2012 was attributable to both the normal seasonality, as well as to the altered production schedules in Europe. Inventories are higher during the transition at our Valtra plant in Finland, where we are installing SAP, and at the Fendt plan in Germany, where we are building a new assembly facility. At the end of March 2012, our North America dealer month's supply on a trailing 12-months basis was lower for combines and hay equipment and higher for tractors than the same time a year ago. Our dealer month's supply in North America was as follows: Tractors were 6.5 months, 3 months for combine and 7.5 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: Losses on sales of receivables associated with our receivable financing facilities, which is included in other expense net, were approximately $5.2 million during the first quarter of 2012 compared to $3.6 million in the same period of 2011. Slide 10 details our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. In 2012, we expect to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $350 million as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve factory productivity and complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly facilities in China. Slide 11 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash used in operating activities, less capital expenditures. AGCO's use of cash in the first quarter of 2012 was stronger than the first quarter of 2011 due to our higher inventory build for the selling season. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on those strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in over $200 million range during 2012. Our regional market outlook for 2012 is captured on Slide 12. Our forecast anticipates continued strong demand on a global basis. In North America, the solid financial position of row crop farmers and the expectation of farm income above historical averages is expected to support demand from the professional farming sector. We also look for improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors, which will help hay equipment demand. In South America, we expect elevated level of farm income in 2012 and the clarity around the government financing programs to keep demand at a relatively high level. However, dry weather impacted the first harvest in Southern Brazil and in Argentina. We expect the dry conditions to result in a modest decline in industry demand compared to 2012. Healthy income for grain and dairy farmers in 2012 is expected to keep Western European demand strong. We were forecasting modest growth in key Western European markets, offset by declines in Southern Europe. Better harvest in Russia and Eastern Europe in 2012 are expected to produce robust growth in these markets. Slide 13 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2012 outlook. We are forecasting price increases of approximately 3.5% on a consolidated basis, offset by about 5% of negative currency impacts. In 2012, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements are expected to cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 15% or $40 million. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Our SG&A expense is expected to include expenses associated with site and manufacturing startup and market support costs amounting to about $20 million for Fendt and $20 million to $25 million for our Chinese operations. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by about $0.45 per share. The strengthening U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact 2012 EPS by about $0.20 to $0.25 based on current exchange rates. Slide 14 lists our view of selected 2012 financial goals. Our order boards remain strong, and we are projecting 2012 sales in the $10.2 billion to $10.5 billion range. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvement and acquisition impacts are expected to be partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. Including significant planned investments in product development, market development and startup costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve gross and operating margins from 2011 levels. We've increased our target for 2012 earnings per share to approximately $5.50. We expect to increase capital expenditures to be in the $350 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $200 million after funding the expected increase in CapEx. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to take questions."
6,GV_025180_2013Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation's 2013 First Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Peterson, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Sarah, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. We will refer to a slide presentation this morning, and we've posted those slides on our website at in the Investors section. The non- GAAP measures used in that slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of that presentation. We will make forward-looking statements this morning, including demand -- those including demand for our products and the economic and other factors that drive that demand; product development plans and timing of those plans; acquisitions, expansion and modernization plans; and our expectations with respect to the costs and benefits of those plans and timings of those benefits; also, with regards to our future revenue, earnings and other financial metrics. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. These documents discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the first quarter of 2013. AGCO started the year in a very positive way. Our first quarter sales were the best in our history, as we capitalized on improved demand in South America and continued market strength in North America. In addition, AGCO executed our important margin improvement initiatives. First quarter operating margins in our South American segment improved over 400 basis points to 10.4%. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continue to be outstanding and the market demand for large equipment remains very strong in the region. AGCO sales in North America grew by approximately 10% compared to the first quarter of 2012. North American operating margin reached 11.6% in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, production rates at our new Fendt assembly facility in Germany increased to normal levels during the first quarter. As expected, sales mix and Fendt productivity impacted EAME's first quarter operating margins. However, we remain on track to deliver significant EAME margin improvements for the full year of 2013. I'm also pleased to say that we made our first dividend payment in March, a strong testament to the progress of AGCO's ongoing profitability improvement and to the health of our balance sheet. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes are illustrated on Slide 4. First quarter 2013 production was flat compared to the first quarter of 2012. Higher levels of production in our South American and North American factories were offset by lower build rates in Europe. As I mentioned earlier, our production volumes at our Fendt plant in Germany improved throughout the first quarter, and our total output was higher than expected. In 2012, Fendt had a front-end loaded production schedule ahead of the cutover to the new assembly facility in the third quarter. In 2013, our full year production is forecasted to be higher than 2012 with most of the increase coming in the second half of the year due to the low production rate experienced during last year's ramp-up in the new facility. We also expect to achieve improved production efficiency and costs in the second half of 2013. AGCO's order boards at the end of March 2013 were approximately flat in North America, down in Europe and up significantly in South America compared to the end of 2012. We expect unit production volumes for the full year of 2013 to be modestly higher as compared to 2012. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first quarter of 2013. In North America, industry sales grew across all categories of tractors. The strongest growth came from the high horsepower segment due to the healthy income levels of row crop farmers. The combine market also saw strong growth compared to the same period of 2012. Industry unit retail sales of tractors in Western Europe were down modestly for the first quarter of 2013. Market sales results by country remain mixed during the first quarter with weather-related declines experienced in the U.K., Finland and Southern Europe, offsetting growth in France. South American industry retail tractor volumes increased significantly during the first quarter of 2013 and compared to the drought impact of the first quarter of 2012. Favorable exchange and financing rates, improved weather and attractive soft commodity prices have energized the market in South America. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our first quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the first quarter of 2013 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of approximately 3% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The Europe, Africa, Middle East segment reported a net sales decline of approximately 1% excluding the impact of currency during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012. Lower farm income last year and a cold wet start to 2013 contributed to sales declines across many of the Western European markets, offset by growth in France. North American sales increased approximately 10% during the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The positive economics being experienced by the professional farming segment produced increases in high horsepower tractors, combines and implements. AGCO's first quarter 2013 net sales in South America grew about 26% from comparable 2012 levels, excluding currency translation impacts. Higher sales in Brazil due to healthy farm economics and attractive government financing plans accounted for most of the increase. Net sales in our Asia Pacific segment increased approximately 31% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 2012, excluding the impact of currency. Growth in China and East Asia produced most of the increase. Parts sales were $282 million for the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of approximately 6% compared to the same period in 2012, excluding the impact of currency translation. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Gross margins improved about 50 basis points in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the prior year period. The benefits of additional volume, positive net pricing and cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by additional costs associated with the start-up at the Fendt facility and a weaker sales mix. Operating margins were negatively impacted by higher engineering expenses associated with Tier 4 requirements and market development expenses. Europe, Africa, Middle East operating margins were down in the first quarter of 2013 from the high levels achieved in the first quarter of 2012 due to lower production volumes, a weaker mix of products and the impact of net factory start-up costs. North America operating margins exceeded 11% in the first quarter of 2013, up over 250 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2012 due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. In the South America region, operating margins improved to 10.4% in the first quarter 2013. Favorable exchange impacts, cost-reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced most of the increase. You will recall that the first quarter of 2012 was negatively impacted by a very dry weather in Brazil and in Argentina. Margins in the Asia Pacific region were positively impacted by higher sales volumes. Our profitability in this region will be diluted for the remainder of the year due to increased market development expenses in China. Slide 8 details GSI sales by region and by product for the first quarter of 2013. GSI sales were down approximately 5% in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in the last year. U.S. grain storage sales were negatively affected by the carryover impacts of last year's drought. For the first year -- for the full year of 2013, we are forecasting GSI sales and income to be relatively flat compared to 2012. We expect strong growth in Asia and South America to offset a decline in North America. Slide 9 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trend. In 2013, we expect to further increase our capital expenditures as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirement, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Our seasonal requirements for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby result in negative free cash flow in the first quarter 2012 and in '13. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. We also expect to increase inventory at year end as we build the necessary transition stock ahead of Tier 4 final implementation during 2014. At the end of March 2013, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors, 4 months for combine and 8 months for hay equipment. Relative to last year, this was lower for tractors and flat for both hay equipment and combines. Other working capital details are as follows. Losses on sales of receivables associated with our receivable financing facilities, which is included in other expense net, is approximately $5.6 million during the first quarter of 2013 compared to $5.2 million in the same period of 2012. Our outlook for 2013 for regional markets is captured on Slide 11. The revised outlook reflects an increase for the North and South American markets while our Western European market forecast remains unchanged. We're anticipating relatively flat demand on a global basis. In North America, the strong financial position of row crop farmers and the expectation of farm income above historical averages should support healthy demand from the professional farming sector. Strong farm fundamentals are expected to continue in Brazil in 2013 and clarity around government financing programs are expected to stimulate growth of approximately 10% compared to the levels in 2012. We are expecting softer demand in Western Europe with weakness in the U.K. and Northern Europe due to lingering impacts of a wet fall and spring and continued softness in Southern Europe due to tight credit and dry weather. Solid demand across France and Germany is expected to mitigate some of the decline in the other markets. We are also currently forecasting 2013 demand in Western European market to be flat to down 5% compared to 2012. Slide 12 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2013 outlook. Our forecast assumes price increases of approximately 2.5% on a consolidated basis, and we expect the impact of currency translation to be neutral. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense of approximately 15% or about $50 million. We also look for new products and our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. For 2013, our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with site and manufacturing start-up and market support costs amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. We are now forecasting an effective tax rate of between 33% and 34% for 2013. Slide 13 lists our view of selected 2013 financial goals. We are projecting 2013 sales in the range from $10.5 billion to $10.7 billion. We also expect improved gross and operating margins from 2012 levels after significant investments in product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects. We are targeting earnings per share in the range of $5.50 to $5.70 per share for the full year of 2013 while making significant investments in our long-term initiatives. We expect an increased capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $425 million and free cash flow in excess of $150 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with the Tier 4 product transition. In the second quarter, operating margins are expected to be approximately flat with the second quarter of 2012. Second quarter earnings per share are expected to be down 10% to 15% from 2012 levels due to -- primarily due to higher income tax expense. We are projecting earnings growth in the second half of 2013 compared to the same period of last year. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions."
7,GV_025180_2009Q2,"Presentation Operator Good morning, my name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2009 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Greg Peterson, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference, sir. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Brandy. Good morning and welcome to AGCO's Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will refer to a slide presentation. The slides, earnings release, financial statements are posted on our website at  The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides. During the course of the call, we will make forward-looking statements including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, market share improvements, general economic conditions, currency translation impacts, farm income, working capital and its components, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, interest expense, retail sales financing, pricing levels, capital expenditures, plant shutdowns and strategic initiatives. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. I will now turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you Mr. Peterson and good morning, everybody. Since the beginning of the year 2009, AGCO has taken decisive action to adjust our business to the slowing demand we are seeing across all of our end markets. We have reduced our production, lowered our work force level by over 17% and cut operating expenses. We started a discipline program to lower our inventory levels in order to deliver on our targeted levels of 2009 free cash flow. During the second quarter, when we typically see a seasonal build in inventories, we were able to bring down inventory by more than $235 million on a constant-currency basis compared to March 2009 levels. We have more work to do and plan to underproduce projected retail demand in the second half of the year. Slide 3 shows AGCO's results for the second quarter and first six months of 2009. Our second quarter sales were down by about 25% due to primarily softening demand in all our major markets. The challenging global economic conditions and the volatility in commodity prices contributed to a great deal of conservatism and farmers equipment purchase decisions. Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of products compared to the second quarter of 2008 resulted in a drop in adjusted operating margins to 4.5%. We saw a mixed result across our operating segments during the second quarter. The profitability of our North American unit continued to improve. Despite the pressure from lower production levels, operating margins surpassed 5.5% as new products, lower warranty experience, improved factory productivity and the positive impact of currency translation all contributed to margin expansion. In our South American region, we saw a significant decline in the results in the second quarter. Weak market demand, lower production and mix of product heavily weighted towards lower margin. Lower horsepower tractors and the negative impact of currency all contributed significantly lower sales and operating income. Slide 4 now illustrates our production volumes for 2008 and the first half of 2009 as well as our current forecast for the remainder of 2009. Second quarter 2009 tractor and combined production levels were down 35% compared to the second quarter of 2008. At the end of July, a full combination of layoffs, furloughs and dismissal of temporary workers, we have reduced the workforce by over 3,000 since the beginning of the year. In the first half of 2009, we had temporary plant shutdowns at nearly all of our facilities across Europe, North America and South America. We’ve reduced assembly shift at our plants in Brazil and Finland and reduced fabrication, welding and paint shifts at our plants in Jackson, Minnesota and Hesston, Kansas. The softening global demand is evidenced in our order boards which has declined significantly. At the end of June, the backlog was just under half the level we saw at June 30, 2008. In response of the softening demand, our full year 2009 production of tractor and combines is expected to be down about 20% to 25% from 2008 levels. In the third and fourth quarter, we will have additional temporary plant shutdowns on top of the normal maintenance shutdowns. These production cuts will have a significant impact on our second half sales and earnings with the heaviest impact in the third quarter. Slide 5 details industry, retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first six months of 2009. Industry tractor sales in North America were down 22% compared to 2008 levels. The most significant declines occurred in the sub [ph] 100-horsepower Tractor segment which are closely tied to the weak areas of residential construction and livestock production. All contractors were also down from last year's robust levels. The combine market grew approximately 30% during the first six months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. We believe much of the increase is the result of timing for deliveries for competitors' presale programs which were pulled forward to earlier in the year to accept weaker demand in export market and full year demand to end up below 2008 levels. AGCO's total unit sales of tractors and combines in the first six months of 2009 were both down from the same period last year. For 2009, we expect the largest declines for tractors under 100 horsepower and lower demand for tractors over 100 horsepower compared to 2008 industry retail sales levels. Industry retail tractor volumes were down by about 13% in Europe in the first six months of 2009 compared to 2008. The credit constraint markets of Eastern Europe and Russia have seen the sharpest declines. In Western Europe, dairy farmers and meat producers has been hit hard by low prices and industry sales in those sectors are down significantly. Demand in Western Europe was down across all over the larger markets, expect for France, with the weakest condition in Scandinavia and Spain. For the remainder of the year, we expect lower income across all the farming sectors will result in weaker industry demand in Western Europe and more significant market declines are expected in Eastern and Central Europe and Russia due to severe credit limitations. South American industry retail tractor volumes decreased approximately 25% during the first six months of 2009 compared to 2008. Drought conditions and limited credit availability in Argentina contributed to a decline of about 58% in Argentine retail tractor volumes. Total industry retail tractor sales in Brazil decreased 6% in the first six months of 2009. The new government financing program for small agriculture tractors stimulated an increase in sales in this category. Industry retail sales of higher horsepower tractors were down significantly for the first six months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. We expect 2009 South American industry retail volumes to be down significantly from 2008 levels due to the dry weather conditions and the impact of tightened credit on planted acreage and crop production. Andy will now provide you with more details of our second quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the second quarter of 2009 is outlined on Slide 6. For the second quarter of 2009, currency translation had a negative impact of approximately 10.8% on AGCO's consolidated net sales. At the current exchange rate hold, we're estimating the current translation reduced our 2009 net sales by approximately $750 million to $850 million. During the second quarter of 2009, the Europe, Africa, Middle East segment had a net sales decline of approximately 16% excluding the impact of currency translation compared to the second quarter of 2008. The EAME segment sales were weakest in the Baltics, Eastern and Central Europe and Russia. Declines in those markets were partially offset by modest growth in both Germany and France. North America net sales were approximately flat in the second quarter of 2009 compared to 2008, excluding currency translation impacts. Higher sales on high-horsepower tractors and balers were offset by declines in compact and midrange tractors. Second quarter 2009 net sales in South America declined approximately 26% from 2008, excluding currency. Softer market demand in Argentina and Brazil and the shift in mix to lower horsepower tractors and Brazil drove most of the decline. Net sales in our Asia- Pacific segment were approximately flat in the second quarter of 2009 to compared to 2008, excluding currency impacts. Parts sales for the second quarter of 2009 were $256.1 million, down approximately 4% compared to the same period of 2008 after removing the impact of currency. For the first six months of 2009, parts sales were 449.9 million, down approximately 3% compared to 2008, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 7 reviews AGCO's sales and margin performance. Gross margins were down approximately 170 basis points in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2008. Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of sales in South America were partially offset by improvements in North America. Adjusted operating margins were 4.1% in the first half of 2009. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating income in our North America segment showed improvement with operating margins reaching 5.5% for the second quarter of 2009. The positive impact of the stronger dollar on imported tractors, lower warranty costs and expense control initiatives all contributed to the improvement. We expect additional production cuts and dealer destocking will lead to lower net sales and margins in the second half of the year. Operating margins in AGCO's Europe, Africa, Middle East region declined about 420 basis points. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focused on our high-horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the margin compression. Declining market demand produced lower sales and significantly lower production led to the drop in operating margins in our South America business. The shift in the mix of products towards smaller, lower-margin tractors also contributed to the decline in operating margins. Slide 8 highlights the improvement that we have made with our working capital over the last three years. It also highlights the need we have to further reduce our inventories in the second half of the year. Working down our inventory levels in the second half of the year is a top priority. Martin will walk you through our planned production cuts which are aimed at lowering our company in the order inventory levels. The strongest dealer destocking is planned for our North America region in the second half of the year. Our sales and earnings will be impacted for the remainder of the year with the heaviest impact expected to be in the third quarter. We are targeting to the end 2009 with inventory below 2008 year end levels. At the end of June 2009, our North America dealer month's supply on a trailing 12-month basis was higher than the same time a year ago. They were 5.5 months for tractors, six months for combines and 8.5 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: Outstanding funding under accounts receivable securitization programs was approximately 482.2 million at June 30, 2009, compared to 497 million at June 30, 2008. We have had an uninterrupted access to funding through our securitization facilities to date and have liquidity backups in place for this funding source if needed. Losses on sales or receivables primarily under these securitization facilities which is included in other expense net was 5.2 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared to 8.3 million for the same period in 2008. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures. Our seasonal demands for working capital are greater in the first half of the year and thereby generated negative free cash flow for both the first half of 2009 and 2008. While we have made a significant reduction in our inventory since the end of March, our strong production cuts have also resulted in lower accounts payables which limited the benefit in working capital and cash flow. In the second half of the year, we expect inventory reductions to outpace our stabilizing payables position. As a result, we expect reductions in working capital will contribute to cash flow generation in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. As Martin explained, we plan to continue to invest for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending in these strategic investments, we are targeting improved free cash flow this year. Slide 10 addresses the assumptions underlying our 2009 outlook. With the global recession, tightened credit markets and volatile commodity prices, there remains an uncertainty around the market conditions we face in the second half of the year. You can see from this slide that our outlook for 2009 anticipates declines in all global markets. Some other specific assumptions include: the strengthening dollar and the impact of translation on our sales outside the U.S. that is expected to reduce our sales between 9% and 10%; our 2009 forecast assumes pricing increases of approximately 3.5% to 4% on a consolidated basis. In 2009, AGCO will continue to invest for future growth, including increases in both capital expenditures and research and development. In terms of interest expense, just as a reminder that AGCO has adopted FSP APB 14-1 on January 1 of this year. The implementation of this rule resulted in approximately $3.8 million of additional non-cash interest expense related to our convertible notes in the second quarter of 2009. Interest expense was also restated to include 3.5 million of additional interest expense for the second quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, FSP APB 14-1 is expected to result in approximately $15 million of additional non-cash interest expense. Our effective tax rate was approximately 25% for the second quarter of 2009 compared to 32.5% for the second quarter of 2008. The decrease results primarily from the improved profitability of our North America business. We were able to utilize some of the net operating loss carry forwards to lower the effective of tax rate in North America to near zero. For the remainder of the year, we expect our effective tax rate to range from 30% to 35%. Slide 11 list our view of selected 2009 financial goals. With the uncertainty around market demand in mind, we are projecting 2009 sales to range from $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion. While our 2009 results are very important to us, we are also focused on AGCO's long term profitability and we will maintain our investments in engineering and capital expenditures this year. With that long term focus and the uncertainty that surrounds our market demand, our forecast for 2009 diluted earnings per share ranges from $2 to $2.25. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $275 million range and free cash flow in the $150 million to $200 million range after funding our strategic investments. For the third quarter of 2009, we expect softer market demand, inventory reduction, the negative impacts of currency translation to result in sales declines of 25% to 30% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Lower sales in production, increased engineering expenses and the negative impacts of currency translation will keep third quarter 2009 earnings per share below half of the level in the third quarter of 2008. That concludes our prepared comments. Operator, we're now ready to open the call -- open for question and answers."
8,GV_025180_2010Q2,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Wendy, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to AGCO Corporation's 2010 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Wendy, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. We will refer to a slide presentation this morning, which is posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We'll also make forward-looking statements including some related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market demand and conditions, margin and productivity improvements, cost-reduction efforts, assembly capabilities, product line initiatives, working capital, free cash flow, exchange rates, production volumes, general economic conditions, pricing increases, capital expenditures, pension and benefit plan costs and restructuring engineering expenses. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning. AGCO benefitted from its global diversity during the second quarter of 2010. Industry conditions were very mixed. Our strong market position across South America allowing us to take advantage of robust market conditions. Our sales doubled in that region compared to the second quarter of 2009. This success helped to partially offset the weak market conditions across Europe. While demand continues to be weak in Europe, we have achieved stabilization in the order flow from our dealers and our order board in Europe is up about 25% at the end of June 2010 compared to the end of June 2009. Our order boards in North America are up about 20% and our South American order boards are nearly double what they had been at the end of June 2009. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the second quarter and first six months of 2010. AGCO sales were down approximately 1% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Despite the lower sales, our gross margins were almost 200 basis points higher in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Higher production levels and material cost management helped achieve higher margins in the second quarter. Our tractor and combine production volumes for 2009 and projected volumes for 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. Our factories operated at more normal production levels in the second quarter, with our second quarter 2010 tractor and combine production levels up 28% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Significantly higher production in South America was offset by lower production in both North America and European factories. The lower production in North America and Europe over the first half of the year helped us manage the seasonal build in our inventory and our dealers’ inventory in 2010. Production levels in the second half of 2010 are also expected to be above 2009 second-half levels. We expect that the higher production in the back half of 2010 will produce higher gross margins compared to the second half of 2009. For the full year of 2010, we are projecting our total tractor and combine production to be up 5% to 8% from 2009 levels. Slide 5 details industry unit volume by region for the first half of 2010. Industry tractor sales in North America were up only slightly compared to the first half of 2009 levels. The compact tractor category, which is tied more closely to the general economy, was up 5% in the first six months of 2010 compared to lower levels experienced during the same period last year. The high horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economies and increased 10% compared to the first half of 2009. Declines in utility tractor sales partially offset growth in the other segments. The combine market grew approximately 1% during the first six months of 2010 compared to the strong levels in 2009. AGCO's total unit sales of tractors and combines in the first half of 2010 were both down from 2009 levels. Industry unit retail sales in Western Europe weakened further in the second quarter. Industry sales were down 19% in the first half of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. Slower recovery of the general economy, weaker farmer sentiment and softness in the dairy and livestock sectors all contributed to the decline. Demand was softest in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. South American industry retail tractor volumes increased approximately 57% during the first half of 2010 compared to the relatively weak second quarter of 2009. Strong crop production in Brazil and the attractive financing program supported by the government contributed to strong market demand. Better harvest in Argentina resulted in market growth of about 53% in the first six months of 2010 compared to the drought-impacted volumes in the first six months of 2009. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our second quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for 2010 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a positive impact of less than 1% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the second quarter. Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales decline of approximately 10%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. The most significant declines occurred in France and Germany. Sales and production were significantly lower in 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009, due to soft retail market conditions. North American net sales were down approximately 19%, excluding currency translation impacts, during the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Hay tools, mid-ranged tractors and implements showed the most weakness. Dealer inventory, destocking initiatives and softer end market demand in the Dairy and Cattle Producer segments contributed to the decline. AGCO's second quarter 2010 net sales in South America increased approximately 74% from comparable 2009 levels, excluding currency translation impacts. In Brazil, strong harvests and the extension of low- interest rate, government-sponsored financing programs resulted in strong industry sales. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to the improved results in Argentina. Net sales in our Rest of the World segment declined approximately 18% in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 2009, including the impact of currency. Lower sales in Australia and in New Zealand contributed to most of the decline. Parts sales were $269.7 million and $477.0 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2010, which was an increase of approximately 7% for the quarter and 3% for the first half compared to the same periods in 2009, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Gross margins were up approximately 190 basis points in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Increased production volumes in South America and lower material cost contributed to the improvement. Operating margins were also improved, but increased expenditures for engineering and other initiatives mitigated some of the improvement. Operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region declined slightly in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses were partially offset by lower material costs. In the South America region, operating margins rebounded to 9.3%, an increase of over 800 basis points for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. Robust market demand in Brazil and improved conditions in Argentina produced higher sales in both countries. Increased production and the shift in the mix of products towards larger high horsepower, higher-margin tractors also contributed to the improvement. In the second quarter of 2010, operating income declined in North America due to lower sales and production cut. Weak demand from the dairy and livestock producers resulted in significantly lower sales of our hay equipment and mid-range tractors. Margins for the full year are expected to improve in 2010 compared to 2009. Higher levels of sales and production in the second half of 2010 in both North America and Europe, stronger full-year margins in South America and our global cost-reduction efforts are expected to drive the expected margin improvement. Every year, our operating plan includes a build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring selling seasons. Slide 8 provides visibility into the working capital management in the first six months of 2010. Our first-half growth in working capital was nearly $300 million less than the first half of 2009. As Martin mentioned, we reduced our production in Europe and North America and our position for better performance in the second half of 2010 compared to 2009. At the end of June 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower in all categories than the same time a year ago. We still have work to do in the area of hay equipment. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors were 4.5 months, four months for combines and seven months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: On January 1, 2010, the company adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-16. And as a result of this adoption, the company's European securitization facilities were required to be recognized within the company's consolidated balance sheets. At June 30, 2010, the company's accounts receivable securitization facilities in Europe had outstanding funding of approximately $122 million. Losses on sales of receivables, primarily under our securitization facilities, which is included in other expense net, were approximately $3.7 million and $6.3 million there in the second quarter and first half of 2010 compared to $5.2 million and $10.2 million in the same periods of 2009. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. As a result of stronger cash flow results for the first half of 2010, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of June 2010 was significantly better than at this point a year ago. AGCO's second quarter 2010 free cash flow of $195 million was generated from working capital reductions and improved margins. The production increases in the second quarter resulted in growth in our accounts receivable and a net reduction to working capital. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Slide 10 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. We slowed the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products last year in response to softening market conditions. In the second half of 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China and in Russia. Slide 11 shifts our focus to the assumptions underlying our 2010 outlook. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for our industry and our business. Our strategies are aimed at helping AGCO grow profitably in this environment. Our latest outlook for 2010 anticipates a slightly more pessimistic view for Western European markets and a more positive view of South American market. We're also now forecasting a decline of 10% to 15% in Western Europe; mild growth in the North American tractor and combine markets, with continued weakness in the North America hay equipment market; and a 20% to 25% growth in South America. Our 2010 forecast assumes price increases of 1.5% to 2% on a consolidated basis. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 20% or $40 million. We also look for productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. The impact of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans is expected to increase expenses by approximately $8 million. Slide 12 lists our view of selected 2010 financial goals. We're projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion, a small increase from 2009. We expect pricing benefits and market share improvements to provide some lift despite mixed market demand. Our forecast for 2010 diluted earnings per share ranges from $1.85 to $2 per share. We expect gross margin improvements to be partially offset by higher engineering and pension costs. These earnings per share projections exclude restructuring expenses expected to be incurred in the company's European operations estimated at approximately $0.06 per share for the full year of 2010. We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.20 to $0.25 compared to last quarter's guidance. We increased the guidance for the improvement in the South American market forecast and lowered it for the decrease in our Western European forecast. The net impact of change in market forecast was approximately positive $0.15. We lowered the guidance for the change in currency exchange rates since the time of our first call, primarily due to the devaluation of the euro versus the dollar. Currency had a net negative impact of approximately $0.08 to $0.10 to our latest forecast. We increased our guidance for improved margin experience and the expectation of higher margins in the second half of 2010 by 30 to 40 basis points of margin. The sum of these adjusting items gets you to our current EPS guidance of $1.85 to $2 per share. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect sales to be up significantly from the third quarter of 2009 and earnings per share to be in the $0.40 to $0.45 range. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the call up for questions."
9,GV_025180_2011Q2,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Tamika, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2011 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, July 28, 2011. Thank you. I would like to introduce Greg Peterson. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Tamika, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. We will refer to a slide presentation this morning, which is on our website. The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to the GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We will make forward-looking statements this morning including those related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market conditions, margin improvements, commodity prices, the impacts of currency translation and acquisitions, new product development and market expansion, factory productivity, plant investments, production volumes, free cash flow, depreciation, emission requirements, product line expansion, general economic conditions, pricing benefits, engineering expenses and capital expenditures. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that the actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. We'd also like to remind you that a replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. So this morning I have on the call with us, Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. AGCO delivered another record performance in the second quarter. Farm economics remained strong, and we took advantage of robust market conditions in Europe and North America and posted second quarter sales growth of over 20% on a constant-currency basis compared to the second quarter of 2010. Our focus on margin improvement this year has been quite clear. AGCO's operating margin reached 8.5% during the seasonally strong second quarter. However, Europe, Africa, Middle East regions delivered second quarter operating margins of 12.5%. In North America, we capitalized on healthy industry conditions, woo sales and expanded North American operating margins by over 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2010. As we look to the end of 2011, commodity prices remain at very high levels, a positive sign for farm income and farmer sentiment this year. Slide 3, summarizes our results for the second quarter and first 6 months of 2011. AGCO reported adjusted earnings per share of the second quarter of $1.35, nearly twice what we reported a year ago. In addition, our strong operating performance translated into nearly $200 million of free cash flow for the second quarter of 2011. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. AGCO's second quarter and first half 2011 tractor and combine production was up 8% and 14% compared to the same periods in 2010. Increased production levels in our European and North American factories were partially offset by lower production volumes in South America. AGCO's auto bought for the EAME markets doubled at the end of June 2011 compared to the end of June 2010. Equipment auto bought in North America were also up significantly from June 2010 levels. South American auto bought remained strong but they're down from very high levels at the end of second quarter of 2010. We expect production volumes to be up modestly in the second half of 2011 versus the comparable period in 2010. For the full year of 2011, we expect production to be up approximately 9% from 2010 levels. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first half of 2011. Industry tractor sales in North America were up modestly compared to 2010 levels. In North America, industry sales of compact and utility trucks, as those increased due to improvement in the general economy. Sales of high horsepower tractors remained at an elevated level but declined about 3% compared to the strong levels in first half of 2010. The combine market benefited from favorable whole crop economics and presales whole grain to increase about 8% during the first half of 2011 compared to the same period last year. Industry tractor unit retail sales in Western Europe were up approximately 14% in the first 6 months of 2011 compared to the weak level experienced in the same period last year. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the Dairy and Livestock sectors contributed to the growth. Industry growth was strongest in Germany, Scandinavia, France and Finland. South American industry retail tractor volumes decreased modestly during the first 6 months of 2011 compared to strong levels in the first 6 months of 2010. Despite healthy farm economics, declines in Argentina and Brazil were mostly offset by growth in smaller South American markets. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck who will provide you more information on our second quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the second quarter and first half of 2011 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a positive impact of nearly 13% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the second quarter 2011. Acquisitions added approximately 5% of sales in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 40% excluding the impact of currency translation during the second quarter 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. Sales increased in nearly every major market across Europe in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010. The most significant improvements occurred in Germany, France and central Europe. Recall that in the first half of 2010, we managed through weaker market conditions in the U.S. and Western Europe, and were focused on inventory reduction. This year, we operated our factories at normal seasonal levels during both the first and second quarters. Last year, market demand recovered in the back half of the year. So we will face tougher comparables as we move forward into the final 2 quarters of 2011. North American net sales increased approximately 5% excluding currency translation impacts during the second quarter 2011 compared to the same period of 2010, with our dealer inventory de-stocking efforts complete, sales of sprayers, high horsepower tractors and combines all showed improvement in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. AGCO's second quarter 2011 net sales in South America were flat from comparable 2010 levels excluding currency translation. Trade disruptions in Argentina and lighter demand in Brazil for small tractors, resulted in sales declines in those markets for AGCO during the second quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Strong growth in the smaller South American markets offset the decline in Brazil and Argentina. Net sales in our Rest of the World segment increased approximately 52% in the second quarter compared to 2010, excluding the impact of currency. Sales growth in Australia, New Zealand, Eastern Europe and Russia produced the increase. Part sales were $363 million and $635 million for the second quarter and first half of 2011, an increase of approximately 23% for the quarter and 26% for the first half compared to the same periods in 2010 excluding currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Adjusted operating margins were up nearly 300 basis points in the second quarter 2011 compared to the second quarter of 2010. The benefit of increased production volumes, material cost control, pricing and leverage over operating expenses, resulted in the improvement. As Martin mentioned earlier, second quarter 2011 operating margins in AGCO's Europe, Africa, Middle East region were 12.5%, up significantly on a year-over-year basis. Margins were improved in the second quarter of 2011 compared to the same period of 2010 due to higher sales and production volumes, better pricing and a richer mix of products. In South America region, operating margins declined in the second quarter of 2011 compared to 2010. A weaker geographic mix, lower levels of production, increased material costs and higher operating expenses contributed to the decline. In the second quarter of 2011, operating margins improved significantly in North America due to higher sales and production along with cost control initiatives as you can see on the next slide. Slide 8 looks at North America profitability in more detail. Margins in this region have been one of our main focus areas for the last few years. You can see from the graph on the slide that we have made significant progress. In the second quarter of 2011, our margins improved over 500 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2008 on lower sales. We Introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics cost and improved the efficiency of our factories. Second quarter of 2011 operating margins also benefited from higher levels of production, pricing and improved leverage over operating costs compared to the second quarter of 2010. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the second quarter remains very strong. AGCO's second quarter cash flow of $193 million, which generated from elevated sales levels and improved margins and covered a $76 million-increase in capital expenditures. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering the increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting positive free cash flow for 2011. At the end of June 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows: Tractors were at 4.9 months, 4 months for combine and 8 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: Losses on sales or receivables, which is included in both interest expense net and other expense net were approximately $5.2 million and $8.8 million for the second quarter and the first 6 months of 2011 compared to $4.3 million and $7.5 million for the same period of 2010. During the second quarter, we redeemed our EUR 200 million 6 and 7/8 notes due April 15, 2004. This early redemption was funded with a new of EUR 200 million senior unsecured term loan. The new term loan is due May 2, 2016, and bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.5%. We recorded expenses of approximately $4.3 million. With an interest expense in the second quarter in connection with the redemption. Interest savings from the lower rate on the new loan is expected to completely offset this loss by the end of 2011. Slide 10 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity in Germany and make investments in China and Russia. Through the first 6 months of 2011, our capital investments totaled $112 million and will accelerate through the rest of the year. Our outlook for 2011 for our regional market is captured on Slide 11. We anticipate modest growth in North America as the strong financial position of row crop farmers and the projection of farm income above historical averages is expected to support strong demand. We expect the South American market to remain strong but be down 5% to 10%. Higher prices for grain and dairy farmers in Western Europe and improved farmer sentiment are expected to generate market growth of about 15% compared to weak levels in 2010. Slide 12 lists our view of selected 2011 financial goal. We are projecting 2011 sales to range from $8.5 billion to $8.7 billion. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvements, the positive impact of currency and acquisition impacts are all expected to contribute to the growth. Including significant investments in product development and market development, we expect 2011 earnings to be improved from 2010 levels. We are raising our target for 2011 earnings per share to $4 per share. We expect to increase capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $350 million range and our free cash flow to remain positive and exceed $150 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. In the third quarter of 2011, earnings per share are expected to be flat with the $0.66 reported in the third quarter of 2010. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we expect higher sales and gross margin improvement to be offset by increases in engineering and market development expenses as well as a more normal tax rate. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we expect strong sales and earnings growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks we are now ready to open up the conference for questions."
10,GV_025180_2012Q2,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation's 2012 Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Peterson. Please go ahead, sir. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning, and welcome to those of you joining us for our call and Internet playback of that call for AGCO second quarter earnings. We will refer to a slide presentation, which is posted on our website at and we'll also use some non-GAAP measures during our presentation this morning. And we've got those non-GAAP measures reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We'll be making forward-looking statements this morning, including projections of earnings per share, sales, demand, government financing programs, market conditions, farm incomes and production, commodity prices, margins, currency translation, pricing increases, productivity, investments in product development, facilities and expanding markets, inventory and production models, acquisition impacts, completion of facility construction and upgrades, industry demand, general economic conditions, engineering efforts, depreciation, free cash flow, supplier issues and capital expenditures. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. And finally, a replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Martin. Please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. AGCO posted another quarter of outstanding results with strong sales growth and record quarter earnings. We took advantage of healthy market conditions while executing against our important margin improvement initiatives and delivered second quarter sales growth of over 14% and gross margin expansion of 200 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2011. Both our Europe, Africa, Middle East and North American business delivered operating margins in excess of 12%, and our South American margins rebounded to 9%. North America posted operating margins of 10% in its core business for the second quarter, the best in over 10 years. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the second quarter and first half of 2012. In the second quarter, we reported sales close [ph] across all of our regions compared to the second quarter of 2011 on a constant currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $2.08 and reflected both strong execution and the benefit of higher production volumes. In the second half of 2012, we plan to increase our investments in new product development and facility and market expansion. AGCO forecast for tractor and combine production volumes for 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. Second quarter 2012 production was up 5% compared to the second quarter of 2011. High-horsepower tractor and combine production was about flat with the second quarter of last year in North America and Europe, but production of lower-horsepower tractors were up. Production levels in our South American factories were modestly lower than the levels in the second quarter of 2011. In September, we expect to start our production in the new assembly facility at Schengen [ph] Marktoberdorf, Germany. The production schedule in Germany was more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year to compensate for lower production during the third quarter when the new assembly facility will be brought online. The production schedule at our Valtra plant in Finland was lower in the first half of 2012 compared to 2011 in conjunction with our SAP conversion and offset some of the increase in Germany. AGCO's order board at the end of June remained in very good shape. In Europe, the order board is down about 10% from very high levels at the end of June 2011. North America high-horsepower tractor and combine orders are down about 5% compared to June 2011 levels. While order books are still healthy, we are closely monitoring the impact on orders in the second half demand from the severe drought being further caused much of the U.S. corn belt. The order board in South America is up about 20% compared to June 2011 levels. We expect production volumes to be up modestly for the remainder of the year. And for the full year of 2012, we expect production to be up approximately 10% from 2011 levels. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first half of 2012. Industry tractor sales in North America were up modestly compared to 2011 levels. In North America, industry sales of high-horsepower and utility tractors both increased due to higher levels of farm income in 2011. The combine market was down significantly compared to the second half of 2011 due to the timing of industry production and due to very high levels of demand experienced in 2011. Industry unit retail sales of tractors in Western Europe were down modestly in the first 6 months of 2012. And growth in the key markets of France, the United Kingdom and Germany was partially offset by declines in Southern Europe markets like Italy and Spain. South American industry retail tractor volumes declined during the first half of 2012 compared to the first half of 2011. Dry weather impacted the first harvest in Southern Brazil and Argentina. Industry demand was negatively impacted earlier this year. Favorable exchange rates, improved weather and healthy farm economics have stabilized the market in South America. I will now turn the call over to Andy, who will provide you more information on our second quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the second quarter and first half of 2012 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of about 11% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2012. Acquisitions added approximately 11% of sales in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The Europe, Africa, Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 12%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011. Growth was highest in Germany, France, U.K. and Russia and was partially offset by sales declines in some of the Southern European markets. North American sales increased approximately 88%, excluding currency translation impacts during the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding acquisition impacts, the growth was approximately 45%. Increases in hay equipment sprayers and high-horsepower tractors produced most of the growth. AGCO's second quarter net sales in South America grew 9% from comparable 2011 levels, excluding currency. Acquisitions generated about half of the growth and higher sales in Brazil due to improved crop fundamentals were partially offset by declines in Argentina. Net sales in our Asia Pacific segment increased approximately 17% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, excluding the impact of currency translation and the benefit of acquisition. Sales growth in Australia and New Zealand produced most of the organic increase. Parts sales were $357 million for the second quarter of 2012, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the same period in 2011 excluding currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. AGCO's operating margins were up over 130 basis points in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2011. The benefit of increased production volumes, a favorable pricing environment and only modest inflationary pressure around materials accounted for most of the margin improvement. Operating margins in the second quarter of 2012 in AGCO's Europe, Africa, Middle East region surpassed 12%. The EAME margins were approximately flat compared to the same period in 2011. North America's second quarter operating margins exceeded 13%, including the benefit from GSI. Core margins were up significantly due to higher sales and production and favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. In South America, operating margins improved to 9.3% in the second quarter, up approximately 170 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2011. Favorable exchange impacts, improving pricing and higher sales volumes produced the increase. GSI, our new grain storage and protein production business, performed well in its seasonally strong second quarter. Slide 8 details GSI's sales by region and by product for the first half of 2012. GSI sales grew 7% in the 6 months of 2012 compared to the same period of last year. Sales grew across all regions with the strongest growth in Asia. GSI contributed approximately $0.30 of EPS during the second quarter of 2012. We are closely monitoring the impact of the ongoing drought in the U.S. on GSI's North American grain storage and protein production businesses. However, with higher international sales and better margin experience, we are still expecting approximately $0.45 of accretion for the full year of 2012. Slide 9 highlights our inventory and receivables position at the end of the second quarter. Every year, our operating plan includes an increase of dealer and company inventory required for the selling seasons. The inventory build in the first half of 2012 was attributable to normal seasonality, as well as the accelerated production schedules in Europe and some supplier delivery constraints. We expect to reduce inventory by the end of 2012 as we complete our plant improvements and work through some supplier issues. At the end of June 2012, our North America dealer month's supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower for hay equipment and higher for combines and tractors versus the same period a year ago. Our dealer month's supply in North America was as follows: tractors were 6.5 months, 5 months for combine and 6 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details were as follows. Losses on sales of receivables associated with our receivable financing facilities, which is included in other expense net, were approximately $5.4 million during the second quarter of 2012 compared to $5.2 million in the same period of 2011. Slide 10 details our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. In 2012, we expect to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $375 million as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly capabilities in China. Slide 11 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures. AGCO's use of cash in the first half of 2012 was elevated compared to the first half of 2011 due to our higher inventory build in our increased schedule of capital projects. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering these increased strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow to exceed $200 million during 2012. Our regional market outlook for 2012 is captured on Slide 12. Our forecast anticipates continued stable demand on a global basis. In North America, the solid financial position of row crop farmers and the outlook for farm income above historical averages is expected to mitigate some of the impact of the drought that will reduce crop production this year. The expectation of lower crop yields plus uncertainty around industry demand in the second half of 2012. In South America, we expect an elevated demand in the second half of 2012, strong crop prices, favorable exchange rates and the clarity around government financing programs to keep demand at relatively high level. The improvement in the second half of 2012 is expected to mitigate most of the softness experienced in the first half of the year, resulting from a first weak harvest in Southern Brazil and Argentina. Higher soft commodity prices are expected to produce healthy income for European grain farmers in 2012 and are expected to keep demand stable. We are forecasting modest growth in key Western European markets, offset by declines in Southern Europe. Better harvests in Russia and Eastern Europe in 2012 are also expected to produce strong growth in these markets. Slide 13 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2012 outlook. We are forecasting price increases between 3% and 3.5% on a consolidated basis, offset by about 8% of negative currency impacts. In 2012, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements are expected to cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or $40 million. We anticipate the benefit of new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Our forecast includes expenses associated with site and manufacturing start-up and market support costs amounting to about $20 million for Fendt and $20 million to $25 million for expansion into China. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by about $0.45, and the strengthening U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact our 2012 EPS by about $0.40 per share based on the current euro and real exchange rates. Slide 14 lists our view of selected 2012 financial goals. Our order boards remain healthy, and we are projecting 2012 sales in the $10.1 billion to $10.3 billion range. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvements and acquisition impacts are expected to be partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. Including significant planned investments in our -- and product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve growth and operating margins from 2011 levels. We are now targeting 2012 earnings per share to be in the range from $5.50 to $5.75 per share. We expect the increased capital expenditures to be in the $375 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $200 million after funding the expected increase in CapEx. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."
11,GV_025180_2013Q2,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2013 Second Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, and welcome to those of you joining us here on our second quarter earnings results call. We will be going over some slides this morning. You'll find those slides posted on our website at on the Investors page. The non-GAAP measures that are used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We'll also be making some forward-looking statements this morning, including demand for our products and the economic and other factors that drive that demand, product development plans and timing of those plans, acquisition, expansion and modernization plans and our expectations with respect to the costs and benefits of those plans and timing of those benefits in our future revenue earnings and other financial metrics. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning is Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone with us on the call. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the second quarter and first 6 months of 2013. As you can see from this slide, we made significant progress in the second quarter towards both our growth and profitability improvement growth. Our record second quarter sales were 13% over the second quarter of 2012. We generated solid sales growth across all of our regions despite challenging conditions in certain markets. In addition, AGCO's focus on margin improvement produced operating margins over 10% in the second quarter. We are successfully increasing margins through purchasing actions, factory efficiency projects and new product development. Second quarter operating margins exceeded 15% in North America, were over 12% in Europe/Africa/Middle East and over 11% in South America. Sales growth and improved profitability produced record earnings in the second quarter of $2.15 per share. Performance against our working capital target is also on track, and we are positioned for another year of strong cash flow generation. As Andy Beck will discuss in more detail, we have increased both our earnings guidance and our forecast for free cash flow. I also want to emphasize that we are continuing to invest for the long term. Our product development expenses will be nearly up 15% this year and our capital expenditure program is expected to exceed $400 million for 2013. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes are illustrated on Slide 4. Second quarter 2013 production was up about 7% compared to the second quarter of 2012. The production growth was strongest in South America, with more modest growth in our North American and European factories. I'm also very pleased to tell you that we achieved record production volumes at our new Fendt assembly facility in Germany in the second quarter and reached significantly import productivity levels. As we discussed last quarter, our full year Fendt production is forecasted to be higher than in 2012. A large portion of the increase will occur in the second half of the year due to the low production rates experienced during last year's ramp-up in the new facility. Our third and fourth quarter European sales and income will benefit from Fendt's higher production levels. We expect total AGCO unit production for the full year of 2013 to increase between 6% and 8% as compared to 2012. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first half of 2013. In North America, industry sales grew across all categories of tractors. The strongest growth came from the high horsepower segment, due to the healthy income levels for local farmers. The combine market also showed strong growth compared to the same period of 2012. Industry unit retail sales of tractors in Western Europe were down modestly for the first 6 months of 2013. Market results by country remains mixed during the first half of the year with weather-related declines experienced in the U.K., Finland, Southern Europe, partially mitigated by growth in France. Industry sales in the important German market were down slightly in the first half versus 2012. South American industry retail tractor volumes increased significantly during the first half of 2013 compared to the drought-impacted first half of 2012. Favorable exchange and financing rates, improved weather and attractive soft commodity prices have energized the market in Brazil. Industry sales were also up strongly in Argentina. I will now turn the call over to Andy, who will provide you more information on our second quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the second quarter and first half of 2013 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of approximately 0.5% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported net sales growth of approximately 12%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the second quarter of 2012. Strong growth in France and Germany, largely enabled by Fendt's improved production capabilities, generated most of the increase. North American sales grew approximately 8% during the second quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Sales increases experienced in the professional farming segment produced growth in sprayers, combines and high horsepower tractors. AGCO's second quarter 2013 net sales in South America grew about 28% from comparable 2012 levels, excluding currency translation impacts. Higher sales in Brazil and Argentina accounted for most of the increase. Net sales in our Asia/Pacific segment increased approximately 18% in the second quarter of 2013 compared to 2012, excluding the impact of currency. Growth in China and East Asia produced most of the increase. Parts sales were $382 million for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the same period of 2012, excluding currency. For the first 6 months of 2013, parts sales were $664 million, up approximately 1% compared to the same period in 2012, excluding the impact of currency translation. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Gross margins improved about 60 basis points in the second quarter 2013 compared to the prior year period. Margins benefited from higher sales and production volumes, limited material inflation, pricing and cost reduction initiatives. Operating margins expanded nearly 90 basis points in the second quarter despite the negative impact of market development expenses and higher engineering expenses associated with Tier 4 requirements. Europe/Africa/Middle East operating margins were up over 70 basis points in the second quarter of 2013 from the same period in 2012, due primarily to the higher production and sales levels at Fendt, partially offset by higher engineering expenses. Our third and fourth quarter margins will also benefit from favorable cost comparisons due to Fendt assembly plant start-up costs incurred in the back half of 2012. As Martin mentioned earlier, North America's operating margins exceeded 15% in the second quarter of 2013 and were up over 230 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012 due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. In the South America region, operating margins improved over 170 basis points in the second quarter of 2013. Favorable exchange impacts, cost-reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced the increase. You may also recall that the first half of 2012 was negatively impacted by very dry weather in Brazil and Argentina. Margins in the Asia-Pacific region were down modestly due to increased market development expenses in China. Slide 8 details GSI sales by region and product. GSI sales were down approximately 4% in the second quarter and first half of 2013 compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the timing of protein production equipment sales in China. The negative effects of last year's drought on U.S. grain storage sales in North America have now lessened. The outlook for improved grain production in the U.S. this year is generating stronger demand for storage and conditioning equipment, and we have increased the forecast for GSI sales in the second half of the year. We are now forecasting GSI sales to be up 5% to 10% for the full year of 2013 compared to 2012. Longer term, the global trends of population growth and changing diets are generating demand for additional grain storage and protein production capacity. This countercyclical nature of the protein production sector also supports more stable earnings in GSI. Slide 9 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. In 2013, we expect to further increase our capital expenditures, as we work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. Our seasonal requirements for working capital were less than the first half of 2013 compared to the first half of 2012. We expect to generate strong cash flow again this year and plan to continue investing in our plants and new products. We also expect an increase in inventory at the year end, as we build the necessary transition stock ahead of Tier 4 final introductions during 2014. At the end of June 2013, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for both tractors and combines and 7 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: Losses on sales of receivables associated with our receivable financing facilities, which is included in other expense net, were approximately $6.5 million during the second quarter of 2013 compared to $5.4 million in the same period of 2012. Our 2013 regional market outlook is captured on Slide 11. We are anticipating relatively flat demand on a global basis. The revised outlook reflects an increase in the South America market, while the North American and Western European market forecasts did not change. In North America the strong financial position of row crop farmers and the expectation of farm income above historical averages should support healthy demand from the professional farming sector. Strong farm fundamentals are expected to continue in Brazil in 2013, and increased funding levels for the government financing programs are expected to stimulate growth in excess of 15% compared to the levels in 2012. We are expecting softer demand in Western Europe, with weakness in the U.K. and Northern Europe due to the lingering impacts of a wet spring and continued softness in Southern Europe due to tight credit and dry weather. Solid demand across France and Germany is expected to mitigate some of the decline in Northern and Southern Europe. We are currently forecasting 2013 demand in Western European market to be down between 0% and 5% compared to 2012. Slide 12 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2013 outlook. Our forecast assumes price increases of 2% to 2.5% on a consolidated basis, and we expect the impacts of currency translation to be modestly negative. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expenses of approximately 15% or about $50 million. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with manufacturing sites start-up and marketing support costs, amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. Lastly, our effective tax rate forecast remains 33% to 34% for the full year of 2013. As you may recall, we did make a change in the fourth quarter of 2012 in the accounting for our U.S. deferred tax assets, which resulted in an increase in our effective tax rate for 2013. For the first half of 2013, the higher effective tax rate impacted our earnings per share by about $0.31 and the full year impact is expected to be about $0.44 per share. Slide 13 lists our views on selected 2013 financial goals. We are projecting 2013 sales in the range of $10.8 billion to $11 billion. We also expect improved gross and operating margins from 2012 levels after significant investments in product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects. We are increasing our earnings per share outlook. We are now targeting earnings per share in the range of $6 for the full year of 2013. We expect to increase capital expenditures to be in the $400 million to $425 million range and free cash flow of approximately $200 million, after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with the Tier 4 product transition. And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."
12,GV_025180_2008Q3,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon. My name is Samarian and I will be your conference operator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to AGCO, Your Agricultural Company 2008 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, today's conference is being recorded today, October 29, 2008. Thank you. Mr. Greg Peterson, you may begin. Greg Peterson Thank you Samarian, good morning. We appreciate you joining us for AGCO's third quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call we will refer to a slide presentation. The slides, earnings press release, and our financial statements are posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, supplier and production constraints, inflation, foreign income, working capital improvement, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. I will now turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Thank you, Greg and good morning everybody. We appreciate your attention this sunny October morning. We've experienced volatility over the last few weeks and you'll likely see more in the weeks and months ahead. We believe AGCO, Your Agriculture Company, is well positioned financially, strategically, and operationally to serve our customers and execute on the positive long-term fundamentals of the agriculture sector. These maintained a high level of financial discipline and it's reflected on our balance sheet with our low level of net debt. Given our overall financial health we're comfortable that we've the right policies in place to protect and grow our business even through this current financial climate. In general, our dealers and our farm customers are in the healthiest financial condition in recent memory. Their balance sheets are strong and in general their access to credit remains very good. Today AGCO Finance, our joint venture with Rabobank provides financing for about 50% of AGCO's retail sales, AGCO Finance is well capitalized. It does not rely on the commercial paper or securitization markets for its funding and its stands ready to increase its participation in financing our retail sales should other credit sources tighten. I also am pleased to tell you that despite the challenges in the financial markets AGCO's backlog remains strong and we have not seen a significant change in the flow of orders. 2008 harvest are at or above last years robust levels. And we expect healthy farm income in all the world's major agricultural markets. Let's turn our attention now to AGCO's third quarter results. I'll begin my remarks on slide 3. You can see from this slide that we have continued our momentum for the third quarter of 2008 which resulted in record quarterly sales and earnings. Strong demand for our high horse power tractors and combines produced an increase in our sales of approximately 29% compared to the third quarter of 2007. And our drafted earnings per share rose to $1.04. We managed through significant material cost increases during the quarter and experienced no debt deterioration of our operating margins. This is quite impressive given the rich mix of sales in the third quarter of 2007 within an unseasonable high percentage of our sales coming from our premium price and products. Slide 4 now illustrates our production schedules for 2007 and 2008. Tractor and combine production levels were up 11% in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the third quarter of 2007. Production was up to support the increased demand across the globe. Our current 2008 forecast calls for unit production of tractors and combines to increase 18% to 19% compared to 2007 levels in order to satisfy the forecasted increase in the market demand. The elevated demand for industrial and farm equipment continued to put stress on AGCO's supply chain. We are working with our suppliers and focusing on key internal processes to meet our production schedules by the end of the year. Slide 5, details in that preview the farm equipments volume by region for the first nine month of 2008. Industry tractor sales in North America were down 5% compared to 2007 levels. The weakest segment continued to be tractors under 40 horsepower that are more closely tied to the general economy. We also experienced declines in the 400 to 100 horsepower category. The professional farming segment continues to benefit from positive cash crop economics and sales are up approximately 33% in the overrun in the horsepower tractor segment and the combine market grew approximately 25% in the first nine months of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. While AGCO's total unit tractor sales were lower in the first nine month of 2008, AGCO's unit sales of tractor over 100 horsepower and combines both showed strong growth doing the first nine months of 2008. For the full year of 2008, we expect weakness in tractors and that horsepower had continued growth in high horsepower tractor in the North American industry retail market. Industry tractor volumes were up approximately 9% and move up in the first nine months of 2008 versus the same period last year. And strong harvest in France, Germany, Russia, and Central and Eastern Europe are driving increases in European industry volumes. Our forecast for 2008 calls for market conditions in Europe to remain healthy with continued strong growth in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia and more modest growth in Western Europe. South America, the South American industry tractor volumes increased approximately 36% during the first nine months of 2008. Strong conditions in Brazil and Argentina are driving most of the South American growth. Combine sales more than doubled in Brazil and also showed improvement in Argentina. For the full year of 2008 we expect the markets in both Brazil and Argentina to remain strong and contribute to an increase in South America and the industry demand compared to 2007 robust levels. Globally, the markets are healthy and as I mentioned earlier our order boards remain strong. I will now turn the call overt to Andy Beck who will provide you with more details. Andrew H. Beck Thank you, Martin and good morning. Slide six details AGCO's regional net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 2008. The bar graph shows our regional sales performance excluding the impact of currency translation. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2008 currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 7% and 11% respectively. If the current exchange rate holds, currency translation will put pressure on our fourth quarter sales. During the third quarter, the Europe, Africa, Middle East segment had sales growth of approximately 15% excluding the impact of currency translation compared to the third quarter of 2007. The growth in our Europe, Africa, Middle East segment in the third quarter was led by Germany, France, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe and Russia. North America sales increased approximately 26% compared to the third quarter of 2007 excluding currency. Strong sales results in tractors, hay tools, sprayers, combines, and parts contributed to the improvement. First nine months of 2008 sales in North America increased approximately 23%, excluding currency. Third quarter sales in South America improved approximately 38% from last year excluding currency translation. Good harvest and farm land expansions are driving double digit sales growth across nearly all the markets in South America even after excluding currency translation impacts. Sales in our Asia-Pacific segment increased approximately 34% in the third quarter compared to 2007 excluding the impact of currency. Improved harvest in Australia and New Zealand, have sales well ahead of the draught impact of 2007 levels. On a year-to-date, sales were up 38% compared to 2007 excluding currency impacts. Globally, our net pricing for the quarter was a little below 5%. Part sales for the third quarter 2008 were $301.1 million, up 19% compared to the same period in 2007, after removing the impact of currency. Growth was strong in all four of our reporting segments. For the first nine months of 2008, part sales were $838.1 million compared to $657 million in 2007. Slide 7 highlights our sales and margin performance. Despite absorbing material cost increases, operating margins of 6.8% for the third quarter of 2008 match those seen in the third quarter of 2007. As Martin mentioned earlier, this was a significant accomplishment given the rich mix of sales we had in the third quarter of 2007. If you recall, in the first half of 2007, sales of our premium price set tractors were unseasonably low due to supplier constraints and the shifting of production of our new high horse power tractor. Production and sales were much heavier in the second half of 2007 and as a result our sales mix was richer and our margins higher especially in the third quarter of 2007. Our South America business reported operating margins of 8.8% for the third quarter of 2008, the absorption benefits from higher volumes were offset by three factors first, raw material cost inflation which hit us hardest in this region; second, the negative currency translation impacts associated with sales of equipment manufactured in Brazil and exported to other countries in South America, and finally increased product development expenses in the region. Third quarter operating income in our North America's segment was positive for the first time in over two years. Volume growth to market strength and new product introduction and distribution improvements, positive pricing environment and expense savings all contributed to the improvement. The positive results in North America all came just by currency pressure continuing in the third quarter. Our effective tax rate was approximately 31% in the third quarter of 2008, we expect the rate to be similar in the fourth quarter. Slide 8 highlights the progress we are making with working capital reductions as we've focused on improving our return on assets. At the end of the third quarter AGCO's working capital sales ratio stood at 6.1% down from 9.5% one year ago. Our goal this year is to hold the line on working capital despite the strong sales growth we are experiencing. Much of our working capital focus is now aimed at lowering dealer inventories in North America which have now remained at 2007 levels. At the end of September 2008 our dealer month supply on a trailing 12 month basis in North America were as follows; five months for tractors, four months for combines, and five months for hay equipments. Other working capital details are as follows; outstanding funding under accounts receivable securitization programs was approximately $453.6 million at the end of September 2008 compared to $433.5 million at the end of September 2007. We led uninterrupted access to funding through our securitization facilities to date and have liquidity back ups in place for this funding source, if needed. Wholesale interest bearing receivables transferred to ACGO Finance, our retail finance joint venture in North America as of September 30, 2008, were approximately $67.1 million. Losses on sales receivables primarily under these securitization facilities which is included in other expense net was $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2008 compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2007. For the first nine months of 2008, losses on sales of receivables were $21.6 million compared to $25.5 million in the first 9 months of 2007. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. The graph on the left side of the slide shows the free cash flow during the first nine months of 2008 compared to 2007. Our seasonal demands for working capital are greatest early in the year as we prepare for the selling season and as you can see we've generated negative free cash flow in the first nine month of 2008 and 2007. The fourth quarter is the seasonally strongest when dealer and company inventories are sold down at the end of the year. The graph on the right displays our annual free cash flow for 2007 and our projection for 2008. Our focus in 2008 has been to minimize our investment and working capital while still supporting strong sales growth this year. Even after recovering increased spending on strategic initiatives and capital expenditures for new products we expect to generate strong free cash flow this year. Slide 10 quantifies the impact of our 2008 initiatives. We'll be making significant investments in our future in the form of increased engineering expenses to support a growing list of new product programs, cost associated with our European system initiative, and spending associated with developing new markets and improving our distribution. Through the end of September our sales and margin growth is paying for these investments and generating improvement in earnings in 2008, compared to 2007. Our initiative spending is focused on long-term growth and profitability improvements for the company. Slide 11 lists our latest view of selected 2008 financial goals. We are projecting 2008 sales to increase 22% to 24% driven by healthy market conditions, pricing, and positive impact of currency. The new sales forecast reflects the negative currency translation impact of the recent appreciation of the dollar, including the recent movement and exchange rates our revised sales forecast would have been higher than our previous guidance. We are targeting 2008 EPS to range from $3.90 to $4 while making significantly investment in our long-term initiatives. We expect to increase capital expenditures including additional investments and production capacity to be in the $230 million and $250 million range and our free cash flow to remain strong in the $175 million to $200 million range. That concludes our comments, operator we are now ready to open the call for questions. Question And Answer"
13,GV_025180_2009Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Christy, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2009 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Greg Peterson, Director of Investor Relation. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Christy, and good morning. We appreciate you joining us for AGCO's Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During this conference call, we will refer to a slide presentation, which is posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, general economic conditions, currency translation impacts, farm income, working capital and its components, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, interest expense, retail sales financing, pricing levels, capital expenditures, plant shutdowns and strategic initiatives. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. I will now turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, we continued to execute our plan to cut production, reduce inventory and aggressively control cost. In the third quarter, production was cut by 31% compared to the third quarter of 2008. Our aggressive force realignment removed another 8% of our employees, bringing the year-to-date reduction to 25%. Our disciplined program to lower inventory levels has taken down company and dealer inventories by more than $165 million since June 30. We have more work to do here and plan to underproduce projected retail demand for the remainder of the year. Slide 3 shows AGCO's results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2009. Our third quarter sales was down approximately 33% from the third quarter of 2008 due primarily to weaker demand in all our major markets. The volatility in commodity prices and the expectation of lower farm income has contributed to a great deal of conservatism in farmers' equipment purchase decisions. End market demand continues to soften invest [ph] on Europe and North America, and we saw sales decline steepen in those markets during the third quarter. In Brazil, the mix of our sales is still rated towards smaller tractors but a new government financing program, which includes high horsepower tractors has helped to stabilize the market. In the third quarter of 2009, sales declines, lower production volumes and a weaker mix of products compared to the third quarter of 2008 resulted in a drop in adjusted operating margins to 2.5%. Slide 4 illustrates our production volumes for 2008 and the first nine months of 2009 as well as our current forecast for the fourth quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2009 tractor incumbent production levels were down 31% compared to the third quarter of 2008. At month-end October, for a combination of layoffs, furloughs and dismissal of temporary workers, we reduced the workforce by nearly 4,000 employees since the beginning of the year. In the first nine months of 2009, we had temporary plant shutdowns at all our facilities across Europe, North America and South America. We reduced assembly shifts at our plants in Brazil and Finland and reduced fabrication, welding and paint shifts at all our plants in Jackson, Minnesota and in Hesston, Kansas. The softening global demand is evidenced in our order boards, which have declined significantly. At the end of September 2009, the backlog was just under half the level we saw at September 30, 2008. In response to the softening demand, our full-year 2009 production of tractors and combines is expected to be down close to 25% from 2008 levels. We lowered our production plan for Europe and North America and increased it for improvements in the Brazilian market. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we will have additional temporary plant shutdowns on top of the normal maintenance shutdowns. These production cuts will have a significant impact on fourth quarter sales and earnings. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the first nine months of 2009. Industry tractors sales in North America were down 22% compared to 2008 levels. The most significant declines occurred in the Sub-100 Horsepower Tractor segments, which are closely tied to the weak areas of residential construction and livestock production. Row crop tractors were also down from last year's robust levels. The combine market grew approximately 19% during the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The sales of high horsepower tractors and combines into the professional producer sector have weakened in the third quarter as forward commodity prices declined for most of the quarter and foreign income estimates were lowered. AGCO's total unit sales of tractors and combines in the first nine months of 2009 were both down from the same period last year. Industry sales in Western Europe have weakened further in the third quarter, down 16% in the third quarter of 2009 compared to a 4% reduction in the second quarter of 2009. In AGCO's key markets, third quarter industry sales compared to the third quarter of 2008 were down 18% in France, 11% in Germany and decreased 28% in the U.K. Industry sales for these three countries were approximately flat to the first half of 2009 compared to the same period last year. In addition, the markets of Finland and Scandinavia were both down nearly 40% in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2008 due to soft demand from the dairy and forestry sector. European demand continues to be weakest in the current challenged markets of Eastern and Central Europe and Russia. Order intake across Europe has continued to be weak. Dealers are more conservative with re-orders, and they are less comfortable with the levels of new and used inventories. South American industry yield for tractor volumes decreased approximately 22% during the first nine months of 2009 compared to 2008. Drought conditions and limited credit availability in Argentina contributed to a decline of approximately 62% in Argentine retail tractor volumes. Industry retail tractor sales in Brazil decreased 2% in the first nine months of 2009 with the Brazilian government financing plan for small farms and a new financing program for all equipment helping to stabilize the Brazilian market. We expect 2009 South American industry retail volumes to be down significantly from 2008 levels due to drivers of conditions and the impact of tightening credit on planted acreage and core production. Andy Beck will now provide you with more details of our third quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the third quarter 2009 as outlined on Slide 6. For the third quarter 2009, currency translation had a negative impact of approximately 5% on AGCO's consolidated net sales. If currency rates hold, we are estimating the currency translation will reduce our 2009 net sales by approximately $500 million to $600 million for the full year. During the third quarter of 2009, the Europe/Africa/Middle East segment had a net sales decline of approximately 30% excluding the impact of currency translation compared to the third quarter of 2008. France, Scandinavia, Germany and the U.K. contributed the majority of the Western European decline. Sales in Eastern and Central Europe and Russia continued to be weak. North America net sales were down approximately 32% during the third quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Declines in compact and mid-range tractors, hay tools and sprayers accounted for most of the decline. Sales in the Dairy and Cattle Producer segments showed the most weakness. Third quarter 2009 net sales in South America declined approximately 21% from 2008 levels excluding currency translation impacts. Softer market demand in Argentina and Brazil and the shift in mix to lower horsepower tractors in Brazil drove most of the decline. In the third quarter of 2009, the Brazilian government introduced a new financing program for all equipment. This new program offers interest rates as low as 4.5% and helped stabilize the Brazilian market. The program is set to expire at the end of 2009 but with other favorable financing programs in place to the first half of 2010. Net sales in our Asia-Pacific segment declined approximately 9% in the third quarter of 2009 compared to 2008 excluding the impact of currency. Sales in Asia and the Eastern Pacific continued to be weak and were partially offset by growth in Australia. Part sales for the third quarter of 2009 were $261.1 million, down approximately 8% compared to the same period in 2008 after removing the impact of currency. For the first nine months of 2009, part sales were $711 million, down approximately 4% compared to 2008 excluding currency. Slide 7, reviews AGCO’s sales and margin performance. Gross margins were down approximately 100 basis points in the third quarter of 2009 compared to the third quarter of 2008. Lower production volumes and a weaker mix of sales in South America and Europe were partially offset by improvements in North America. Adjusted operating margins were 3.6% for the first nine months of 2009. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales. Operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region declined significantly for the first nine months of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focused on our high horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the margin compression. In South America, operating margins declined approximately 560 basis points for the first nine months of 2009. Softer market demand produced lower sales and the shift in the mix of products towards smaller, lower-margin, lower-horsepower tractors also contributed to the decline in operating margins. Operating margins did increase sequentially in South America during the third quarter of 2009 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Stronger market demand and an increase in third quarter production compared to the production in the second quarter of 2009 produced the increase. In the third quarter of 2009, operating income in our North America segment declined compared to the third quarter of 2008 due to the significant drop in sales, production cuts and dealer destocking. We expect to continue the destocking in the fourth quarter, which will penalize the net sales and margins in North America. Slide 8 looks at the North America profitability in more detail. While our North American operations continued to lag the performance of our other operations, you can see that this slide, that our operating income for the first nine months of 2009 has improved significantly from the same period last year. As we've discussed previously, we have put a number of initiatives in place to improve North America profitability. Our North American business continues to focus on streamlining our brands, and we are continuing to consolidate our dealer network. Today we stand about 1,000 dealers, down from 1,600 dealers a few years ago. We are reducing our logistics cost with the use of our regional assembly centers and we've added more rigor to our pricing function to ensure we are more responsibly pricing our products. We resourced some of our utility tractors from Brazil to India to improve our small tractor margins. We returned our Sprayer business through profitability by investing in product upgrade and moving the distribution to the CAT® dealer network. We are continuing to invest in new products designed specifically for the North America market. The results of our initiatives have been favorable. While the North America business was not profitable [ph] in the third quarter due to our production cuts and inventory destocking efforts, we expect full year 2009 operating income to improve on 2008 results. In addition, we have other initiatives in the pipeline that we believe will have a positive impact on North America results. Slide 9 details our working capital position at the end of the third quarter. It also highlights the need we have to further reduce our inventory in the fourth quarter. Working down our inventory levels remains a top priority. The largest destocking is planned for our North America region where our sales and earnings will be impacted for the remainder of the year. We are targeting to end 2009 with working capital below 2008 year-end levels. At the end of September 2009, our North America dealer, month supply on a trailing 12 months basis was higher than the same time a year ago, but it's lower in all categories from where we were at June 30, 2009. Tractors were at five-month supply, combines were at five months and hay equipment was at 7.5 months. Other working capital details are as follows: Outstanding funding under accounts receivables securitization programs was approximately $491 million at September 30, 2009, compared to $453.6 million at September 30, 2008. We had an uninterrupted access to funding through our securitization facilities today and have liquidity backups in place for this funding source, if needed. Losses on sales or receivables primarily under our securitization facilities, which is included in other expense net were $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2009 compared to $7.2 million for the same period in 2008. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. While we made a reduction on our inventory since the end of June, our significant production cuts are resulted in lower accounts payables, which limited the benefit in working capital and cash flow. In the fourth quarter, we expect inventory reductions to outpace our stabilizing payables position. As a result, we expect reductions in working capital will contribute to cash flow generation in the fourth quarter. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting improved free cash flow this year. Slide 11 addresses the assumptions underlying our 2009 outlook. With the global recession, volatile commodity prices and lowered expectations of farm income, our order boards are weak and farmers are being very conservative. Consequently, no improvement is anticipated in market demand for the remainder of the year. You can see from this slide that our outlook for 2009 anticipates declines in all global markets. Some other specific assumptions include: The changing value of the dollar and its impact on translation of our sales outside the U.S. is expected to reduce sales between 6% and 7%. Our 2009 forecast assumes pricing increases approximately 3% to 3 1/2% on a consolidated basis. In 2009, AGCO will continue to invest for future growth including strong investments in both capital expenditures and research and development. In terms of interest expense, just a reminder that AGCO's adopted FSP APB 14-1 on January 1 of this year. The implementation resulted in approximately $3.8 million of additional non-cash interest expense related to our convertible notes in the third quarter of 2009. Interest expense was also restated to include $3.6 million of additional interest expense for the third quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, FSP APB 14-1 is expected to result in approximately $15 million of additional non-cash interest expense. Our effective tax rate was approximately 38% for the first nine months compared to 33% for the same period in 2008. In the fourth quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to range from 35% to 40%. Slide 12 lists our view of selected 2009 financial goals. With the weak market demand we are expecting for the remainder of the year, we are projecting 2009 sales to range from $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion. While our 2009 results are very important to us, we are also focused on AGCO's long-term profitability, and we will maintain our investments in engineering and capital expenditures this year. Our forecast for 2009 diluted earnings per share ranges from $1.30 to $1.50. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $200 million to $225 million range and free cash flow in the $50 million to $100 million range after funding of our strategic investments. That concludes our prepared remarks, operator. We'd now like to open the call up for questions."
14,GV_025180_2010Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Angela, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to introduce Greg Peterson. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Angela, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.

On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning. AGCO executed against our operating plan and delivered solid results in the third quarter. The market remained very strong in South America, and AGCO took advantage of that trend by posting third quarter records for net sales and operating income in that region. Europe and North America both reported net sales growth in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. The first-half production cuts and inventory destocking efforts in 2010 brought our dealer and company inventories of new equipment to targeted levels in both of these regions. Economic for row crop farmers in North America are very strong, and the market demand for large equipment remains robust. In Europe, the market remains quite weak, but did stabilize during the third quarter. Commodity prices moved up in the third quarter, which is a positive sign for farm income and farmer sentiment. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010. AGCO's sales improved approximately 19% in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. All four of our geographic segments reported double-digit sales growth on a constant-currency basis. Stronger sales and higher levels of production generated over 200 basis points of improvement in the third quarter operating margins compared to the third quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.66 exceeded our guidance due to higher-than-anticipated operating margins and a lower-than-expected effective tax rate. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2009 and projected volumes for 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. Our factories operated at relatively normal production levels in the third quarter of 2010. AGCO's tractor and combine production increased 35% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Production continued to be significantly higher in South America in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the prior year. North American and European factories also experienced production increases in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. While demand continues to be weak in Europe, order flow from our dealers stabilized and the order board in Europe was up significantly at the end of September 2010 compared to the very weak level at the end of September 2009. Compared to the end of June 2010, orders in Europe are flat. Equipment order boards in North America also increased from September 2009 levels. South American order boards remained strong but were slightly down by 25% from very high levels at the end of September 2009, and down about a third from the end of June 2010. In fourth quarter, we expect lower production volumes in South America relative to the strong levels in fourth quarter of 2009. North American and European production is expected to be higher than the weak levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first nine months of 2010. Industry tractor sales in North America were up only slightly compared to 2009 levels. The compact tractor category, which is tied more closely to the general economy, was up 3% in the first nine months of 2010 compared to lower levels experienced during the same period last year. The High Horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economics and increased 12% compared to the first nine months of 2009. Declines in utility tractor sales partially offset growth in the other segments. The combine market grew approximately 4% during the first nine months of 2010 compared to the strong levels in 2009. AGCO's total unit sales of tractors and combines in the first nine months of 2010 were both down from 2009 levels. Industry unit retail sales in Western Europe stabilized in the third quarter. Industry sales were down at 15% in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. Slower recovery of the general economy, weaker farmer sentiment and softness in the dairy and livestock sector all contributed to the decline. Demand was softest in France, the United Kingdom and Italy. South American industry retail tractor volumes increased approximately 46% during the first nine months of 2010 compared to the relatively weak period in 2009. Strong crop production was still an attractive financing program supported by the government contributed to strong market demand. Better harvest in Argentina resulted in market growth of 57% in the first nine months of 2010 compared to the drought impacted to our volumes in the first nine months of 2009. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our third quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning, everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for 2010 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of nearly 3% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2010. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 12%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. The most significant improvements occurred in Austria, Poland, Scandinavia, United Kingdom and Germany. These gains were partially offset by declines in France and Spain. North American net sales increased approximately 26%, excluding currency translation impacts during the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. With our dealer inventory destocking efforts complete, sales of tractors, combines and sprayers, all showed improvement in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. AGCO's third quarter 2010 net sales in South America increased approximately 39% from comparable 2009 levels, excluding currency translation impacts. In Brazil, strong farm fundamentals and supportive government-sponsored financing programs resulted in strong industry sales. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to improved results in Argentina. Net sales in our Rest of the World segment increased approximately 19% in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, excluding the impact of currency. Growth in China and East Asia was partially offset by lower sales in Australia and New Zealand. Part sales were $268.1 million and $745.1 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2010, an increase of approximately 7% for the quarter and 5% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Operating margins were up approximately 200 basis points in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. The benefit of increased production volumes and material cost controls was partially offset by increasing expenditures for engineering and other initiatives. Third quarter 2010 operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/ Middle East region dipped [ph] (33:23) down sequentially due primarily to seasonal plant maintenance shutdowns. Margins were improved in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to higher sales and production volumes, partially mitigated by increased engineering expenditures. In the South America region, operating margins rebounded to 11.1%, an increase of over 400 basis points for the third quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. Strong market demand in Brazil and improved conditions in Argentina produced higher sales in both countries. Increased production and the shift in the mix of products towards larger, higher-margin tractors also contributed to the improvement. In the third quarter of 2010, operating margins improved in North America due to higher sales and production. Margins for the fourth quarter is expected to improve both sequentially and year-over-year in Europe and North America. Higher level sales and production in the fourth quarter in both regions are expected to drive the improvement. South American industry and AGCO's sales are expected to remain strong in the fourth quarter, but be down from near-record levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. Consequently, fourth quarter margins in South America are expected to decline on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Slide 8 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. As a result of stronger cash flow results for the first nine months of 2010, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of September 2010 was significantly better than at this point a year ago. We're expecting strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter from our seasonal reduction of inventories. This year, we have been investing for future growth in the form of higher engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we're targeting free cash flow in excess of $100 million for the full year of 2010. Our working capital management continues to make progress. At the end of September 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-months basis was lower for tractors and hay equipment compared to the same time a year ago. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: Tractors were 4.9 months, combines 5.5 months, and seven months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: Losses on sales or receivables, primarily under our securitization facilities, which is included in both interest expense net and other expense net were approximately $3.9 million and $11.5 million during the third quarter and first nine months of 2010 compared to $1.5 million and $11.7 million in the same periods of 2009. Slide 9 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trend. We slowed the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products in the last year in response to softer market conditions in Europe. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures, as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line and improve our factory productivity. Slide 10 looks at the assumptions underlying our 2010 outlook. Our latest outlook for 2010 anticipates a slightly more optimistic view for the South America market, with no change to our view of Western Europe and North America. We are now forecasting 20% to 25% growth in South America, a decline of 10% to 15% in Western Europe and mild growth in the North America market. Our 2010 forecast assumes price increases of 1.5% to 2% on a consolidated basis. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 15% or $30 million. We also look for our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. Slide 11 lists our view of selected 2010 financial goals. We are projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion. We expect pricing benefits and market share improvements to provide some lift despite mixed market demand. Our forecast for 2010 diluted earnings per share ranges from $2.10 to $2.20. We expect gross margin improvements to be partially offset by higher engineering and pension costs. These earnings per share projections excluded restructuring expenses expected to be incurred in the company's European operations, estimated at approximately $0.04 per share for the full year of 2010. We have increased our EPS guidance by $0.20 to $0.25 compared to last quarter's guidance to reflect a slightly lower effective tax rate, as well as slight improvement in our operating margins. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the call for questions."
15,GV_025180_2011Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning, my name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2011 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded today, 2011, October 25. Thank you. I would now like to introduce Mr. Richenhagen. Sir, you may begin your conference. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Actually, it's not Mr. Richenhagen, it's Greg Peterson, as usual. Good morning, everybody. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Good morning. Thanks, Brandy. Thanks, Martin. I'd like to welcome all of you who are joining us on the call and over the Internet for our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. We will refer to a slide presentation this morning, which is posted on our website at All of the non- GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We will make some forward-looking statements this morning, including those related to projections of earnings per share, sales, market conditions, margin improvements, commodity prices, farmer income and sentiment, industry demand, the impacts of currency translation, plant and product investments, production volumes, free cash flow, depreciation, emission requirements, product line expansion, general economic conditions, pricing benefits, capital expenditures and the impact of the GSI acquisition including projections regarding integration, synergies, retention of key customers, demand for protein production, infrastructure and grain storage and cash generation. We wish to caution you that these statements or predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website. On the call with me this morning as you've heard already morning is Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. The year 2011 is turning out to be a good year in the global farm equipment industry. Farmers are progressing with their harvest and commodity prices remain at attractive levels. AGCO took advantage of these positive conditions and delivered another quarter of strong sales growth and margin expansion in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year. AGCO's operating margins improved nearly 300 basis points in the first 9 months of 2011 compared to the first 9 months of 2010. Our Europe/Africa/Middle East business delivered exceptional performance in the third quarter. With industry demand below peak levels in Western Europe, our EAME region produced record third quarter sales on a constant-currency basis and improved operating margins by over 350 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2010. In North America, we capitalized on healthy industry conditions, grew sales and for the first 9 months of 2011, expanded operating margins by over 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2010. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011. AGCO reported adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of $0.87, up 32% compared to a year ago. In addition, our strong operating performance translated into improved cash flow. For the first 9 months of 2011, AGCO's free cash flow improved more than $150 million. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. AGCO's third quarter 2011 tractor and combine production was flat compared to the same period in 2010. Lower production volumes in South America were offset by increased production levels in our European and North American factories. AGCO's order board for the North American and EAME markets at the end of September 2011 is double the level at the end of September 2010. South America order boards remained strong but were down from very high levels at the end of third quarter of 2010. We expect production volumes to be up 8% to 9% in the fourth quarter of 2011 versus the comparable period in 2010. For the full year of 2011, we expect production to be up approximately 9% from 2010 levels. Slide 5 details industry volumes, unit volumes, so to say, by region for the first 9 months of 2011. Industry tractor sales in North America were up modestly compared to 2010 levels. In North America, industry sales of utility tractors increased due to improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors. Sales of high horsepower tractors remained elevated and were up slightly from the strong levels in the first 9 months of 2010. As expected, combine industry retail sales were lower in the third quarter and are now down 4% for the first 9 months of 2011 from the high levels experienced last year. Industry tractor unit retail sales in Western Europe were up approximately 12% in the first 9 months of 2011, compared to the weak levels experienced in the same period last year. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the dairy and livestock sector contributed to the growth. Industry growth was strongest in Germany, France, Scandinavia and Finland. South American industry retail tractor volume decreased modestly during the first 9 months of 2011, compared to strong levels in the first 9 months of 2010. Declines in Argentina and Brazil were mostly offset by growth in smaller South American markets. Industry retail sales in Brazil are still on pace to be the second largest in their history. Organic growth and margin improvement continues to be AGCO's primary focus. We will, however, continue to be opportunistic in terms of acquisition that adds to our product offerings or improve our geographic reach. I will finish my remarks this morning with a few comments about our recently announced agreement to acquire GSI. This acquisition is consistent with our long-term strategy of providing productive solutions for the professional farming sector. With a business model similar to AGCO's manufacturing, dealer distribution and ag market focus, GSI will be a good fit to integrate into AGCO's operations. GSI is a strong, profitable, very well-managed ag equipment company that serves AGCO's retail customers. The combined distribution network of our 2 companies allows for greater access to customers in all major markets for both AGCO and GSI. The transaction will also help AGCO's performance both in North America and in developing markets. AGCO will be able to improve GSI's operations in the areas of purchasing, manufacturing and international market expansion. We're also excited about GSI's growth potential in the developing markets of Brazil, Asia and the CIS. Improving income levels, changing diets and population growth in these regions are expected to drive the need for more protein production infrastructure and more grain storage. In addition, GSI's track record of strong profitability and cash generation improves AGCO's overall capacity for investments to support the long-term growth of our business. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our third quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011 is outlined on Slide 7. Currency translation had a positive impact of about 7% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2011. Acquisitions added approximately 4% to sales in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 38%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. Sales increased to nearly every major market across Europe in the third quarter of 2011. The most significant improvements occurred in Germany, France and Scandinavia. In the first 3 quarters of 2010, we managed through weaker market conditions in Western Europe. The Western European market demand began its recovery in the second half of 2010, which will result in tougher comparables for the fourth quarter of 2011. North American net sales increased approximately 10%, excluding currency translation impacts during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Sales of combines and high horsepower tractors showed significant improvement in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. AGCO's third quarter 2011 net sales in South America were flat from comparable 2010 levels, excluding currency translation impacts. Trade disruptions in Argentina and lighter demand in Brazil for small tractors resulted in sales decline in those markets for AGCO during the third quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Strong growth in the smaller South America markets offset the declines in Brazil and Argentina. Net sales in our Rest of the World segment increased approximately 15% in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 2010, excluding the impact of currency translation. Sales growth in Russia and Australia produced most of the increase. Parts sales were $347 million and $982 million for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011, an increase of approximately 22% for the quarter and 24% for the first 9 months of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 8 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Adjusted operating margins were up about 80 basis points in the third quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2010. The benefit of increased production volumes, pricing and leverage of our operating expenses was partially offset by increased material cost and higher engineering and marketing expenses. As Martin mentioned earlier, third quarter 2011 operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region were up over 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Margins were improved in the third quarter of 2011, compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher sales and production volumes, better pricing and a richer mix of products. In South America region, operating margins declined in the third quarter of 2011 compared to 2010. A weaker geographic mix, lower levels of production, increased material cost and higher operating expenses contributed to the decline. In the third quarter of 2011, operating margins improved in North America due to higher sales and production, along with cost control initiatives as you can see on the next slide. Slide 9 shows the improvement in North America profitability in more detail. Margins in this region have been one of our main focus areas over the last few years. You can see from the graph on this slide that we have made significant progress. For the first 9 months of 2011, margins improved nearly 500 basis points on lower sales compared to the same period in 2008. We introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics cost and improved the efficiency of our factories. In the third quarter of 2011, operating margins increased about 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to higher sales of -- higher levels of production and improved pricing, partially offset by higher levels of engineering expense and increased material costs. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the third quarter remains very strong. AGCO's free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2011 of $83 million, improved about $150 million from last year and covered a $100 million increase in capital expenditures. We plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering the increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting positive free cash flow for 2011. At the end of September 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows: tractors were 5 months; 4 months for combines; 6 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: losses on sales of receivables, which is included in both interest expense net and other expense net were approximately $6.9 million and $15.6 million for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2011, compared to $3.9 million and $11.5 million for the same period of 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, we retired the remaining $100 million of our 1 3/4% convertible notes. Slide 11 highlights our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 final emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our German manufacturing facilities and make investments in Russia. Through the first 9 months of 2011, our capital investments totaled $187 million and will remain at high levels through the rest of the year. Our outlook for 2011 for our regional markets is captured on Slide 12. We expect that the trends experienced in the first 9 months to continue for the balance of the year. Modest growth is expected in North America as the healthy financial position of row crop farmers and the projection of farm income above historical averages is expected to support strong demand in the professional farming sector. We expect the South America market to remain elevated but be down 5% to 10% compared to the record demand of 2010. Higher prices for grain and dairy farmers in Western Europe and improved farmer sentiment are expected to generate market growth of about 10% to 15% compared to the weak levels in 2010. Slide 13 lists our view of selected 2011 financial goals. We are projecting 2011 sales to range from $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvements, the positive impact of currency and acquisition impacts are all expected to contribute to the growth. Including significant investments in product development and market development, we expect 2011 earnings to be improved from 2010 levels. We are raising our target for 2011 earnings per share to approximately $4.30 per share, excluding any onetime transaction costs related to the acquisition of GSI. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $300 million range, and our free cash flow to remain positive and exceed $150 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions."
16,GV_025180_2012Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Marly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation's 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Greg Peterson, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Marly, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We will refer to a slide presentation this morning, which is posted on our website at  We will use non-GAAP measures this morning, and we've reconciled those non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We'll also make forward-looking statements this morning, including demand for our products and the economic and other factors that drive that demand; product development plans and timing of those plans; acquisition, expansion, modernization plans and our expectations with respect to the cost and benefits of those plans, and timing of those benefits; and our future revenue, earnings and other financial metrics. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking comments. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Greg. Today, we reported AGCO's third quarter results that included both healthy sales growth and earnings improvement. It is an interesting time in our industry. We are facing a once-in-a-generation drought in North America, but lower yields are being mitigated by higher crop prices and extensive insurance coverage for row-crop farmers. Record farm income is being projected for the U.S., and demand for high horsepower equipment remains elevated. However, the lower levels of crop production have reduced the need for additional storage, and our grain storage business is being pressured in the U.S. While higher crop prices are helping row-crop farmers, they are pressuring the margins for livestock growers, and our protein production business is also facing some short-term challenges. Despite some of these weather-related issues, we continue to make solid progress with margins in both North and South America. And in the third quarter, both regions surpassed operating margins of 9%. We also made progress with one -- with our strategic -- with one of our strategic production initiatives. In September, we opened our new Fendt assembly facility in Marktoberdorf, Germany. The new facility provides AGCO with the most modern, efficient and technology advanced agricultural tractor manufacturing transfer facility in the industry. Our new assembly process is designed to lower manufacturing costs and significantly increase Fendt's tractor capacity. Slide 3 summarizes our results for third quarter and first 9 months of 2012. In the third quarter, we reported sales growth across all regions compared to the same period in 2011 on a constant currency basis. And adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.96 and reflected strong execution despite lower production volume. AGCO's forecasts for tractor and combine production volumes for 2012 are illustrated on Slide 4. Third quarter 2012 production was down about 4% compared to the third quarter of 2011. Lower level of production in North America and Europe were partially offset by increased activity in our South American factories. As you know, the Fendt production schedule in Germany was more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year to compensate for lower production during the third quarter as we brought the new assembly facility online. We are being very conservative as we ramp up the new facility to ensure we maintain our high level of quality and as we make progress with our SAP implementation. Our build rate in Marktoberdorf was lower than we initially planned. Consequently, our sales in September were slightly lower than our forecast. Fourth quarter sales also will be negatively impacted. AGCO's order boards at the end of September were down by about 30% compared to September 2011 in Europe due to weaker demand primarily in Northern and Southern Europe. Orders were down more modestly in North America as we begin planning to transition to Tier 4 final versions on certain products. South American order boards were flat. We expect production volumes to be up modestly for the remainder of the year. And for the full year of 2012, we expect production to be up approximately 4% to 5% from 2011 levels. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes per region for the first 9 months of 2012. Industry tractor sales in North America increased modestly compared to 2011 levels. In North America, industry sales growth was the strongest for high horsepower tractors due to the healthy economics for row-crop farmers. The combine market was down compared to the first 9 months of 2011 due to the Tier 4 transition and as a result of very high levels of demand experienced in 2011. Industry unit retail sales of tractors in Western Europe were flat in the first 9 months of 2012. Growth in the key markets of France, United Kingdom and Germany was offset by declines in Southern Europe due to dry weather and credit constraints and declines in Scandinavia and Finland due to wet weather and the late harvest. Southern American industry retail tractor volumes declined during the first 9 months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Dry weather impacted the first harvest in Southern Brazil and in Argentina, and industry demand was negatively impacted earlier this year. Favorable exchange rates, improved weather and healthy farm economics have stabilized the market in South America. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you with more information on our third quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2012 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of about 11% on AGCO's consolidated net sales, and acquisitions added approximately 10% of sales in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 8%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the positive impact of the GSI acquisition, the EAME sales were about 5% higher than in the same period in 2011. The negative impact of Fendt's lower production, especially on our German sales, was offset by growth in France, Russia and Africa. North American sales increased approximately 52%, excluding currency translation impacts during the third quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Excluding acquisition impacts, the growth was approximately 21%. Increases in high horsepower tractors, sprayers and hay equipment produced most of the growth. AGCO's third quarter net sales in South America grew about 14% from comparable 2011 levels, excluding currency translation impacts. Acquisitions generated about 4% of the growth. Higher sales in Brazil due to improved crop fundamentals accounted for most of the increase. Net sales in our Asia/Pacific segment increased approximately 24% in the third quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, excluding the impact of currency translation and the benefit of acquisitions. Sales growth in China and Australia produced most of the organic increase. Part sales were $330 million for the third quarter of 2012, an increase of approximately 4% compared to the same period in 2011, excluding the impact of currency translation. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Adjusted operating margins were up about 60 basis points in the third quarter of 2012 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Gross margins benefited from a favorable pricing environment, and we faced only modest inflationary pressure for the purchase -- for purchased materials. Gross margins were impacted by costs associated with the start-up and low production at the Fendt facility in the third quarter. Operating margins were negatively impacted by market development expenses. Operating margins in the third quarter of 2012 in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East segment were down slightly compared to the same period in 2011 due to lower production volumes, a weaker mix of products and the impact of the Fendt factory start-up costs. North America's third quarter operating margins reached 9.5%, including the benefit of GSI. Core margins were up significantly due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost-control initiatives. In the South American region, operating margins improved to 9.4% in the third quarter of 2012, up approximately 250 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2011. Favorable exchange impacts, cost- reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced the increase. As Martin mentioned, in the third quarter, we started to feel the impacts of the U.S. drought on our grain storage and protein production businesses in North America. Slide 8 details GSI sales by region and by product for the first 9 months of 2012. GSI sales grew about 3% in the first 9 months of 2012 compared to the same period last year. Strong growth in Asia was partially offset by a slight decline in North America. GSI contributed approximately $0.50 of earnings per share during the first 9 months of the year. With the impact of the drought in the U.S. on GSI's North America grain storage and protein production businesses, we are reducing the projected full year EPS contribution of GSI to $0.30 to $0.45 per share for the full year. Slide 9 details our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. In 2012, we expect to increase our capital expenditures to approximately $375 million as we continue to work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly capabilities in China. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by or used in operating activities less capital expenditures. AGCO's use of cash in the first 9 months of 2012 was elevated compared to the first 9 months of 2011 due to our inventory build and our increased schedule of capital projects. Every year, our operating plan includes an increase in dealer and company inventory required for the selling seasons. The heavier inventory build in the first 9 months of 2012 was attributable to stronger sales, supplier delivery constraints and the slower ramp-up in the new Fendt assembly facility in September. We expect to reduce inventory in the fourth quarter as we complete our plant improvements and work through our supplier issues. We expect to generate strong cash flow in the fourth quarter and plan to continue investing for future growth in the form of engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering the increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow to exceed $150 million during 2012. At the end of September 2012, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors and combines and 6 months for hay equipment. Relative to last year, this was flat for tractors and hay equipment and higher for combines. Other working capital details are as follows. Losses on sales receivables associated with our receivable financing facilities, which is included in other expense net, were approximately $5.8 million during the third quarter of 2012 compared to $6.9 million in the same period during 2011. In addition, AGCO repurchased 224,000 of its shares during the third quarter for a total cost of about $9.5 million. Our regional market outlook for 2012 is captured on Slide 11. Our forecast anticipates relatively stable demand across a global basis. In North America, the solid financial position of row-crop farmers and the outlook for record farm income is expected to mitigate most of the impact of the drought that will reduce crop production this year. In South America, we expect elevated demand in the fourth quarter, as strong crop prices, favorable exchange rates and enhanced government financing programs keep demand at a relatively high level. The improvement in the second half of 2012 is expected to offset most of the softness experienced in the first half of the year, resulting from the first -- the weak first harvest in Southern Brazil and in Argentina. Higher soft commodity prices are expected to provide healthy income for European grain farmers in 2012, supporting retail demand. We are forecasting modest growth in key Western European markets, offset by declines in Southern Europe due to dry weather and credit constraints and declines in Scandinavia and Finland due to wet weather and lower crop production. Slide 12 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2012 outlook. Our sales forecast includes price increases between 3% and 3.5% on a consolidated basis, offset by 7% of negative currency impacts. In 2012, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements are expected to cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or $40 million. We anticipate that our new products and our productivity and purchasing initiatives will drive improved gross margins. Our forecast includes an increase in costs associated with the start-up and ramp-up of production at our Fendt tractor facility. For the full year, the impact of start-up costs and lower productivity during the ramp- up period throughout the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $25 million. In addition, our forecast includes $20 million to $25 million for expansion in China. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by $0.35 to $0.40. In addition, the strengthening U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact 2012 EPS by about $0.30 to $0.35 based on the current exchange rates. Slide 13 lists our view of selected 2012 financial goals. We are projecting 2012 sales in the $9.8 billion to $10 billion range. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvements and acquisition impacts are expected to be partially offset by the negative impact of currency translation. Including significant planned investments and product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve gross margins from 2011 levels. We're now targeting 2012 earnings per share of about $5.20 per share. Earnings per share forecast was reduced since last quarter to take into account lower sales expectations at GSI in North America due to the impact of the drought, lower sales projections in Europe due to weaker Northern European market conditions and the impact to sales and margins of the slower ramp-up of production at our Fendt tractor operations. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $375 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $150 million after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. Operator, that concludes our remarks. We're ready to take questions."
17,GV_025180_2013Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Toni, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation's 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Toni, and good morning. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call for our third quarter 2013 earnings announcement. We refer you to the slide presentation, which is posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the slides. We will make forward-looking statements this morning, including demand for our products and economic and other factors that drive that demand. Product development plans and timing of those plans, acquisition expansion and modernization plans and our expectations with respect to cost and benefits of those plans and timing of those benefits and our future earnings, revenue and other financial metrics. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg. Good morning to everyone joining us on the call. We appreciate your interest in AGCO. We would start on Slide 3, which summarizes our results for the record third quarter and record first 9 months of 2013. We saw solid progress on both the top and the bottom line during the quarter. Our third quarter sales were about 8% higher than the third quarter of 2012. Global demand for farm equipment remains very healthy, but conditions vary widely across the developed ag markets. We are seeing robust demand in Brazil, solid conditions in North America and continued sluggishness in Europe. We continued to make strides toward our margin improvement programs, evidenced by nearly 200 basis points of improvement in our third quarter operating margins compared to the third quarter of 2012. AGCO's purchasing actions, factory efficiency projects and new product developments are all contributing to our improved profitability. Sales growth and higher margins produced record earnings in the quarter of $1.27 per share. I also want to emphasize that we are continuing to invest for the long term. Our product development expenses will be up nearly 15% this year and our capital expenditure program is expected to exceed $400 million for 2013. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes are illustrated on Slide 4. Third quarter 2013 production was up about 7% compared to the third quarter of 2012. The production growth was strongest in South America, with more modest growth in our North American factories. Production was down slightly in Europe, where strong growth at our new Fendt assembly facility in Germany was offset by lower production levels at our Massey Ferguson and Valtra factories. As we discussed last quarter, our full year Fendt production is forecasted to be higher than in 2012. We expect total AGCO unit production for the full year of 2013 to increase between 5% and 7% as compared to 2012. At the end of September, AGCO's order boards were up in South America and down in North America and Europe. We expect active end of year retail activity, which should support order flow in the fourth quarter. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the first 9 months of 2013. In North America, industry sales grew across all categories of tractors. The combine market also showed growth compared to the high sales levels experienced in 2012. Industry unit retail sales of tractors in Western Europe were down modestly for the first 9 months of 2013. Market results by country remained mixed during the first 9 months over the year, with weather-related declines experienced in the United Kingdom, Finland and Southern Europe, partially mitigated by growth in France. Industry sales in the important German market were down slightly in the first 9 months versus 2012. South American industry retail tractor volumes increased significantly during the first 9 months of 2013 compared to the same period last year. Favorable exchange and financing rates, improved weather and attractive soft commodity prices have generated strong demand in Brazil. Industry sales were also up strongly in Argentina. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our third quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. I will start with a look at AGCO's regional net sales performance for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2013, which are outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of approximately 1.8% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a decline in net sales of approximately 2%, excluding the positive impact of currency translation during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. Sales declines in Central and Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom were offset by growth in Germany and France, largely enabled by Fendt's improved production capabilities. North America sales grew 9% during the third quarter of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Sales increases experienced in the professional producer segment generated growth in grain storage equipment, sprayers and midrange and high horsepower tractors. AGCO's third quarter 2013 net sales in South America grew about 35% from comparable 2012 levels, excluding negative currency translation impacts. Higher sales in Brazil and Argentina accounted for most of the increase. Attractive commodity prices, favorable financing rates and a weaker real all contributed to the strong demand in Brazil. Net sales in our Asia Pacific segment increased approximately 11% in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 2012, excluding the impact of currency translation. Growth in China, Australia and New Zealand produced most of the increase. Parts sales were $370 million for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of approximately 11% compared to the same period in 2012, excluding the impact of currency. For the first 9 months of 2013, parts sales were up or just over $1 billion, up approximately 4% compared to the same period in 2012, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Gross margins improved over 100 basis points in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the prior-year period. Margins benefited from higher sales and production volume, limited material cost inflation, pricing and cost-reduction initiatives. Operating margins expanded nearly 200 basis points in the third quarter of 2013 compared to 2012, due to higher gross margin and better leverage on our SG&A expenses. Europe/Africa/Middle East operating margins were up over 130 basis points in the third quarter of 2013 from the same period in 2012, due primarily to higher production and sales levels, partially offset by higher engineering expenses. Our fourth quarter margins will also benefit from favorable cost comparisons to the Fendt assembly plant start-up costs incurred in the back half of 2012, but will be partially offset by lower production end levels in other European facilities. North America's operating margins exceeded 11% in the third quarter of 2013 and were nearly 190 basis points higher as compared to the third quarter of 2012 due to increased sales, a favorable sales mix, particularly related to high-margin GSI sales and cost control initiatives. In South America region, operating margins improved 300 basis points in the third quarter of 2013. Higher sales volumes and cost-reduction benefits resulted in the margin improvement. Margins in the Asia Pacific region were down due to increased market development expenses in China. Slide 8 details GSI sales by region and by project -- product. GSI sales were up about 9% in the third quarter and year-to-date sales were flat compared to the same period in 2012. U.S. grain storage sales improved in the third quarter compared to last year's drought-impacted results and accounted for most of GSI's third quarter increase. We are now forecasting GSI sales to be up between 5% and 7% for the full year of 2013 compared to 2012. Longer term, the global trends of population growth and changing diets are generating demand for additional grain storage and protein production capacity. The countercyclical nature of the protein production sector supports more stable earnings in GSI. Slide 9 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. Our 2013 capital expenditures will remain elevated as we continue to work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures. We managed our seasonal working capital requirements very closely this year and are in a good position to generate strong cash flow in the fourth quarter. In terms of inventory metrics, at the end of September 2013, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was in the 5 to 6 months range for tractors, combine and hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows: losses on sales receivables associated with our receivable financing facilities, which is included in other expense net, were approximately $6.7 million during the third quarter of 2013 compared to $5.8 million in the same period of 2012. As we have discussed throughout the year, we expect an increase in inventory at year end as we build the necessary transition stock ahead of Tier 4 Final introductions during 2014. AGCO's strong cash generation will allow us to invest in our plants and new products and continue returning cash to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. Our 2013 regional market outlook is captured on Slide 11. We are anticipating relatively flat demand on a global basis. In North America, farmers' strong financial positions and the expectation of near-record farm income in 2013 are expected to support healthy retail demand, especially in the professional farming sector, through the end of the year. Strong farm fundamentals are expected to continue in Brazil in 2013 and the attractive terms for the government financing programs are in place through the end of the year are expected to stimulate growth in excess of 15% compared to the same levels in -- compared to the levels in 2012. We are expecting softer demand in Western Europe, with weakness in the U.K. and Central and Eastern Europe. Solid demand across France and Germany is expected to mitigate some of the weakness in other areas. We are continuing to expect 2013 demand in Western Europe market to be down between 0% and 5% compared to 2012. Slide 12 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2013 outlook. Our forecast assumes price increases of approximately 2% on a consolidated basis, and we expect the impact of currency translation to be relatively neutral. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expenses of approximately 15% or about $50 million. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with manufacturing start-up and market support costs, amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. Lastly, our effective tax rate forecast is approximately 34% for the full year of 2013. Slide 13 lists our views of selected 2013 financial goals. We are projecting 2013 sales in the range from $10.8 billion to $11 billion. We expect improved gross margins and operating margins from 2012 levels after significant investments in product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects. We continue to target EPS of approximately $6 per share for the full year of 2013. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $400 million to $425 million range and free cash flow in the $200 million to $250 million, after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with Tier 4 product transition. With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator, we're ready for questions now."
18,GV_025180_2007Q4,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Kimberly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2007 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Richenhagen, President and CEO. Greg Peterson Hi. This is Greg Peterson, I'll start off Kimberly, and I would tell to wish everyone good morning, and thank you for joining us for AGCO's fourth quarter 2007 earnings conference call. During this conference call we will refer to a slide presentation. The slide presentation, earnings press release, and our financial statements are posted on our website at agcocorp.com in the Investors and Media section The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides. On the call with me this morning are; Mr. Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started this morning, let me remind you that during the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements, including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, supplier constraints, farm income, working capital improvement, cash flow, and strategic initiatives. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2006. These documents discuss important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. I will now turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Good morning, everybody. I think I am delight of the breath taking performance of AGCO Corporation I have lost my voice this morning. I am sorry for that. Thank you, Greg. Good morning again. Please turn your attention to slide 3, where I'll begin my remarks. You can see from the slide that we had a strong finish to the year. We've posted a record quarterly sales, record earnings and record cash flow. Our sales increased approximately 33% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, and our adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were up 100% compared to the fourth quarter last year. We used our well positioned plans to leverage very healthy market conditions and produced strong results in the quarter. Our Europe, Africa, Middle East segment continues to outpace market growth and improve it's profitability. In Europe Massey Ferguson, Valtra and Fendt all performed well in 2007, with Fendt and Valtra both showing the best sales and margin improvement. The recovery of Brazil's farm machinery industry continued in the fourth quarter and was the key to the 59% growth we saw in our South American sales excluding currency translation. In North America our record farm income produced an increase in our sales of nearly 30%. Our profitability showed improvement in both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2007. Volume growth improved sales mix and ongoing cost improvements all contributed to expansion in our operating margins for the fourth quarter and for full year compared to the same period in 2006. In the fourth quarter AGCO's supply chain continued to feel the stress produced by the strong global demand for industrial and farm equipment, and we see some of that also this year I guess. We didn't experience any extreme issues as we finished 2007, but we are working with our existing suppliers to prepare them for expected demand levels and they also working to qualify new suppliers to mitigate further supply constraints. On slide 4, you can see our production schedules for 2006 and 2007. Tractor and combine production levels were up 27% in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. Production was up to support the strong growth in global demand. In both Europe and South America our production matched retail demand during 2007. Production for the North American region was below retail demand, and we saw further improvement in our dealer inventories at year end. We finished 2007 with production of tractors and combines of approximately 20% compared to 2006 levels. Our account 2008 forecast calls for production of tractor and combines to increase 5% to 8% compared to 2007 levels, in order to satisfy the forecasted increase in the global market demand. Slide 5 details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the full year of 2007. Industry tractor sales in North America were 1% compared to 2006 levels. We continue to see declines in tractors under 40 horsepower and sales growth in all categories above 40 horsepower. The highest growth rates secured in the over 100 horsepower segment. The combine market has grown over 13% in the full year of 2007 compared to 2006, and AGCO's total unit tractor sales were down in the full year of 2007 due to the market weakness in compact tractors. However, AGCO unit sales of tractors over 100 horsepower were high-end 2007 compared to 2006. AGCO had strong growth in combine and hay products sales during the full year of 2007. For 2008 we expect a record level of U.S. farm income in 2007, and continued high commodity prices in 2008 to produce continued growth in the North American market. Industry tractor volumes were up approximately 4% in Europe during the full year of 2007 versus last year. Strong market conditions in Central and Eastern Europe, the UK, France and Scandinavia upsetting weaker market in Spain and Italy. Our forecast for 2008 calls for market conditions in Europe to remain healthy as continued strong growth in Central and Eastern Europe offset some softness in Western Europe. South American industry tractor volumes increased significantly in 2007. Brazil's industry tractor volumes were up 53%, and Argentina's tractor sales increased 34% compared to the full year of 2006. Combine sales more than double in Brazil and also showed improvement in Argentina. In 2008 we expect the market in both Brazil and Argentina to remain strong and contribute to an increase in South America industry demand compared to 2007 robust levels. Globally the markets are very healthy, and our order books remains ahead of where we stood at this time last year. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more details on our results. Andrew H. Beck Thank you, Martin. Slide 6 details AGCO's regional net sales for the fourth quarter and full year of 2007. The bar graph shows our regional sales performance excluding the impact of currency translation. For the fourth quarter of 2007, translation had a positive impact of approximately 12%. Year-to-date translation for the full year of 2007 and had a positive impact of approximately 9%. During the fourth quarter, the Europe, Africa, Middle East segment had sales growth of approximately 13%, excluding the impact of currency translation compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. The growth in our EAME segment in the fourth quarter was led by France, Germany, the UK, Spain, and Eastern Europe. North American sales increased approximately 28%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 excluding currency. We were encouraged by the progress made by our dealer inventories and with our strong sales growth. Increased sales of high horsepower tractors, bailers and hay equipment were responsible for the increase in the fourth quarter. 2007 full year sales in North America increased approximately 15% excluding currency. Fourth quarter sales in South America improved approximately 59% from last year, excluding currency translation. In Brazil, we saw a significant pickup in sales to row crop farmers and continued strength in the sugarcane sector. Sales in Argentina increased approximately 65% excluding currency where higher commodity prices have improved market demand. Sales in our Asia Pacific segment increased approximately 6% in the fourth quarter compared to 2006 excluding currency. For the full year sales were up 3% compared to 2006. Part sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $226.5 million up 15% compared to the same period in 2006 after removing the impact of currency. Growth was strongest in Europe and North America. For the full year of 2007 part sales were $883.6 million compared to $752.8 million in 2006. Slide 7 highlights our sales and margin performance. Operating margins for the fourth quarter and full year of 2007 were up from 2006 levels due to sales growth, improved product mix, and cost control initiatives partially offset by currency impacts primarily in North America. Our EAME markets, which reached 10.4% in the fourth quarter finish the year up 165 basis points compared to 2006 full year operating margins. We were able to accomplish the margin improvement while we increased research and development expense nearly 50% in Europe, Africa, Middle East during the quarter. We saw a strong margin improvement in our Vlatra and Fendt brands, which both have been experiencing growth in the high horsepower's tractor segment. Strong volume growth in our South America business produced operating margins of 9.3% for the full year of 2007 an improvement of approximately 240 basis points compared to the full year of 2006. In the fourth quarter our margins felt pressure from two sources. First, currency impact associated with sales of equipment, manufactured in Brazil, and exported to other countries in South America. And second acquisition impacts from our SFIL acquisition. Operating margins in North America while improved in the fourth quarter continue to be pressured by the appreciation of the Brazilian Riyal and the Euro on the Brazilian and French tractors sold in North America. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2007 also benefited from a reduced tax rate primarily related to improved results in North America and Europe. We expect our 2008 effective tax rate to be in the mid 30% range. Turning to the next slide, working capital continues to be an important focus for us as we concentrate on improving the returns on our assets. Slide 8, reflects the progress we've made and reducing our investment in inventories and receivables. We finished 2007 with our working capital to sales ratio at 8.4%. Our business volumes grew considerablely in 2007 sales for the full year were up over $1.4 billion compared to 2006, and we look for more growth in 2008. However, as a result of our focus working capital management that began in 2006, inventory levels ended 2007 approximately flat with last year when you exclude currency impacts. In North America our dealer inventory month supply has improved for tractors, combines, and hay equipments. At the end of December 2007 our dealer month supply on a trailing 12 months basis were as follows; approximately five months for tractors, four months for combine, and five and half months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows; outstanding funding under our accounts receivable securitization programs was approximately $446.3 million at the end of 2007 compared to $429.6 million at the end of 2006. Wholesale interest bearing receivables transferred to AGCO finance our retail finance joint venture in North America as of the end of December 31, 2007, were approximately $73.3 million. Losses on sales receivable primarily under our securitization facilitates, which is included in other expense net or $10.6 million and $36.1 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2007 respectively these amount compared to $9.6 million and $29.9 million for the same period in 2006. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the full year of 2007 improved to $363 million. In December we shared our plan with you to invest more in 2008 for future growth. We expect to increase research and development expense, new product related capital expenditures, as well as system development costs. We are projecting that 2008 will be another year of strong free cash flow even after covering our increased investments, and receiving a smaller benefit from our working capital initiatives. Slide 10 shows the improvements we have made to our capital in our net debt-to-capital ratios have improved over the last two years our net debt-to-capital ratio was approximately 5% at year end 2007 compared to approximately 31% at the end of 2005. Total debt was $697 million at the end of the fourth quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made on our balance sheet and overall leverage, first importantly, we believe we're in good position to find our strategic investment requirements in the future. Interest expense net for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $6.5 million versus $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. In the full year of 2007 interest expense was $24.1 million compared to $55.2 million with the same period in 2006. The interest savings were generated by debt refinancing, lower debt levels, and increased interest income earned in 2007 compared to 2006. Slide 12 quantifies the impacts of our 2007 and 2008 initiatives. In 2008 we'll be making significant investments in our future in the form of increased engineering expenses to support a growing list of new product programs, cost associated with our European system initiative, and spending associated with developing new markets and improving our distribution. We'll be relying on sales and margin growth the pay for these investments while generating an improvement in earnings in 2008 compared to 2007. Our initiative spending is focused on long-term growth and profitability improvements for the company. Slide 12 list our view of our selected 2008 financial goals. We are projecting 2008 sales to increase 11% to 13% driven by pricing, strengthening markets in North and South America and Eastern Europe, market share improvement, and the impact of currency. Our 2008 results are very important to us however we're also focused on AGCO'S long-term profitability. We are targeting 2008 EPS of $2.75 with a goal to reach $3 per share while making very significant investments in our long-term initiatives. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in our $190 million to $200 million in our free cash flow to remain strong in the $175 million to $200 million range. For the first quarter of 2008 sales growth has expected to be in the 15% to 20% range, and while we are projecting full year 2008 EPS growth in the 10% to 20% range, we expect first quarter 2008 EPS growth in the 40% to 50% range. That concludes our comments. Operator, we are now ready to open the call for questions. Question And Answer"

Thank you. I would now like to introduce Greg Peterson. Mr. Peterson, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Thank you, Britney. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AGCO's fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this conference call, we will refer to a slide presentation. The slides, earnings press release and our financial statements are posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements including some related to future sales, earnings, production levels, market share improvements, availability of financing, general economic conditions, currency translations, foreign income, working capital, cash flow, margins, effective tax rate, interest expense, market conditions, retail sales financing, pricing levels, capital expenditures, and strategic initiatives. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Thank you Greg, and good morning everybody. Since we last spoke in December, we have seen continued slowdown in the global economy and the tightened credit markets are beginning to impact our industry, most notably, in the developing markets of Russia and Eastern Europe and South America. We continue to believe AGCO is well positioned financially, strategically and operationally to serve our customers and execute on the positive long-term fundamentals of the agricultural sector. We've maintained a high level of financial discipline and it's reflected on our balance sheet with our low level of net debt. Our strict focus on agriculture equipment has kept us less exposed to the ailing general economy. Given our overall financial health, we are comfortable that we have the right policies in place to manage our business through this current financial climate. In general, our dealers and our farm customers are in the healthiest financial condition in recent memory. Their balance sheets are strong and in most of the developed markets they continue to have access to credits. Today, AGCO Finance, our joint venture with Rabobank provides financing for about 50% of AGCO's retail sales in our major markets. AGCO Finance is well capitalized. It does not rely on the commercial paper or securitization, well I have to exercise a little more next time, markets for it's funding, and it stands ready to increase its participation in financing our retail sales should other credit sources tighten. Let's turn our attention now to the AGCO's 2008 results. I'll begin my remarks on slide 3. You can see from this slide where AGCO had a strong finish in 2008 with both record sales and record earnings for the full year. Our sales increased over 23% compared to 2007. Our margins expanded nearly 100 basis points, and earnings per share exceeded $4 for the first time in AGCO's history. Slide 4 illustrates our production schedules for 2007 and 2008. Tractor and combine production levels were up 15% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year of 2008, our production of tractors and combines was up approximately 18% from 2007 levels. We did continue to see some supply across constraints in the fourth quarter primarily for tires and wheels. As a result, our year-end inventory finished higher than planned and contributed to the decline in our free cash flow. We are reducing our 2009 production schedules to drive down our inventory levels as well as in response to the softer demand forecasted for 2009. Slide 5, details industry retail farm equipment volumes by region for the full year of 2008. Industry tractor sales in North America were down 7% compared to 2007 levels. The weakest segment continued to be tractor's under 40 horsepower that are more closely tied to residential construction and general economic conditions. The industry also experienced declines in the 40 to 100 horsepower category. The professional farming segment continues to benefit from positive whole crop economics. Industry retail sales were up approximately 24% in the over 100 horsepower tractor segment and the combine market grew approximately 22% in the full year of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. While AGCO's total unit tractor sales were lower in the full year of 2008, AGCO's unit sales of tractors over 100 horsepower and combines both showed strong growth during the full year of 2008 compared to 2007. In the fourth quarter, we saw a steeper decline in North American industry tractor sales which were down approximately 13%. For 2009, we expect continued weakness in tractors under 100 horsepower and moderating demand for high horsepower tractors. Industry tractor volumes were up approximately 7% in Europe in the full year of 2008 compared to 2007. Good harvest and healthy farm income throughout much of Europe total the industry volume increased with the strongest growth in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia. For the fourth quarter of 2008, industry tractor volumes were up only 0.9% from 2007 levels. Our forecast for 2009 calls for market conditions in Europe to remain healthy but softened from 2008 levels. The largest decreases are expected in Eastern Europe and Russia where the credit markets have felt the most impact from the global crisis. South American industry tractor volumes increased approximately 30% during the full year of 2008 compared to 2007. Strong conditions in Brazil, brought most of the South American growth. Combine sales were up nearly 88% in Brazil and 50% for all of South America for the full year of 2008. In the fourth quarter, South American industry tractor sales growth slowed to 15% and industry combine sales declined by approximately 6% from 2007 levels. After record 2008, we expect 2009 South American industry volumes to be down significantly due to the high weather conditions and the impact of the tightened credit environment on planted acreage and crop production. I will now turn the call over to Andrew, who will provide you with more details now. Andrew H. Beck Thank you, Martin. Good morning. Slide six details AGCO's regional net sales for the fourth quarter and full year of 2008. The bar graph shows our regional sales performance excluding the impact of currency translation. For the fourth quarter, currency translation had a negative impact of approximately 13% and for the full year currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 4%. If the currency exchange rates hold, currency translation will continue to put pressure on our 2009 sales. During the fourth quarter, Europe, Africa and Middle East segment had sales growth of approximately 9% excluding the impact of currency translation compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. The growth in our Europe, Africa, Middle East segment in the fourth quarter was led by France, Austria and Central and Eastern Europe. North America sales increased approximately 17% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 excluding currency translation impacts. Strong sales results in combines, hay tools and sprayers contributed to the improvement. Full year 2008 sales in North America increased approximately 21% excluding the impact of currency. Fourth quarter sales in South America improved approximately 18% from 2007 excluding currency. Strong market demand in Brazil drove most of the increase. Sales in our Asia Pacific segment decreased approximately 4% in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to 2007 excluding currency. Despite strong market demand in Australia and New Zealand, shipments from our European factories were delayed and our wholesale revenues were impacted. Product sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were 218.4 million, up 7% compared to the same period in 2007 after removing the impact of currency. Growth was strongest in our South American market. For the full year 2008, product sales were $1 billion compared to 883.6 million in 2007, up 14% compared to 2007 excluding the impact of currency translation. Slide seven highlights our sales and margin performance. In the fourth quarter of 2008, AGCO's pricing actions offset material cost increases. Operating margins were 6.5% in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 60 basis points from those seen in the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating margins were the highest in AGCO's Europe, Africa, Middle East region where they reached 10% for the second consecutive year due to record volumes and strong mix of products. Operating income in our North America segment was positive for the fourth quarter of 2008, as well as for the full year. Volume growth from the market strength and new product introductions, distribution improvements, the positive pricing environment and expense savings initiatives all contributed to the improvement. Operating margins in our South America business increased over 80 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the same period in 2007. The absorption benefits from higher volumes were partially offset by raw material cost inflation which hit us hardest in this region. Our effective tax rate was approximately 31% for the full year of 2008. We're targeting in the low to mid 30% range again for the 2009 effective tax rates. Slide eight reflects the progress we have made in reducing our investments and inventories and receivables. While we did make improvements during 2008, our performance in the fourth quarter was above our targets. Our 2008, year-end inventory levels were higher than we had planned. We were impacted by a number of issues including supplier constraints, limited credit in Eastern Europe and Russia, and also by softening demand. Our supplier constraints were principally tire shortages which delayed production in Europe and resulted in heavier working process inventory. The production delays also caused us to miss sales in Australia and New Zealand which were highlighted earlier on our regional sales slide. In 2009, we are very focused on working down our inventory levels by adjusting our production schedules, particularly in the first half of the year. Longer-term, we have a number of programs in place that should help us drive further working capital reductions. As global systems improvement initiative for our products business was completed in 2008 and is expected to produce inventory savings. Our plant rearrangements and factory process improvement initiatives are also expected to generate savings as we move more of our production to pre-sales and build to order. And finally our distribution strategies are expected to improve inventory turnover and working capital utilization as we progress with rationalization of dealers in North America. At the end of 2008, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12 months basis was improved for combines, level for tractors and up for hay equipment compared to 2007 year-end levels. Specific levels were as follows, approximately five months for tractors, three months for combines and seven months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows. Outstanding funding under accounts receivables securitization programs was approximately $483.2 million at December 31, 2008 and $446.3 million at December 31, 2007. We have had an uninterrupted access to funding through our securitization facilities to-date and have liquidity backups in place for this funding source, if needed. Wholesale interest bearing receivables transferred to ACGO Finance, our retail finance joint venture in North America as of December 2008 were $59 million compared to approximately $73.3 as of December 31, 2007. Losses on sales receivables primarily under our securitization facilities, which is included in other expense net were $5.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $10.6 million for the same period in 2007. For the full year of 2008, losses on sales receivables $27.3 million compared to $36.1 million for the full year of 2007. Slide nine addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. The graph on the slide shows the free cash flow during the full-year of 2008 compared to 2007. Throughout 2008, we explained how the free cash flow would be down from 2007 levels due to increased capital expenditures for additional investments in our plants and new products, as well as increased working capital to support our 20% plus growth in sales. However the year-end levels of working capital caused the decline to be more significant than planned. Supplier delays, limited credit in Eastern European markets and softening demand because our inventory levels to exceed our forecast. Our new reduced production schedules are aimed at working -- lowering our working capital during 2009. Moving to slide 10, its shifts our focus to the assumptions underlying our 2009 outlook. I want to stress that with the global recession tightened credit markets and volatile commodity prices there is considerable uncertainty around the market conditions, we will face this year. You can see from this slide that our outlook for 2009 anticipates some level of softening in all the global markets. Some other specific assumptions also include the strengthening dollar and its impact on the translation of our sales outside the U.S. are expected to pressure our sales by between $800 and $900 million in 2009 Our 2009 forecast assumes pricing increases of approximately 4% on a consolidated basis. In 2009, AGCO will continue to invest for future growth including increases in both capital expenditures and research and development. We also work for our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improve gross margins this year. And finally, the implementation of FSP APB 14-1 in the first quarter of 2009 is expected to result an approximately $15 million of additional non-cash interest expense related to our convertible notes. Moving onto the next slide, despite the level of uncertainty in the markets, we want to continue to provide you with visibility into our business. Slide 11 lists our views of selective 2009 financial goals. We are projecting 2009 sales to range from $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. Forecasted pricing benefits and market share improvements are expected to be offset by the negative impact of currency translation. While our 2009 results are very important to us, we're also focused on AGCO's long-term profitability and we will invest an increased engineering in capital expenditure this year. With that long-term focus and the uncertainty that surrounds market demand in mind, our forecast for 2009 diluted earnings per share ranges from $3 to $3.25 per share. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the range of $275 to $325 million and free cash flow in the $150 to $200 million range, after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures. For the first quarter of 2009, we expect sales declines to 7% to 9% from the first quarter of 2008, due to the negative impact of currency translation, softer market demand and softer market demand. We expect lower volumes and production, increased engineering expense, higher interest expense and a weak product mix will keep our first quarter earnings per share in a range of $0.15 to $0.20. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions and answers."
20,GV_025180_2009Q4,"Presentation Operator Good morning. My name is Jay and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation 2009 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Greg Peterson. Sir, you may begin your conference. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Jay. Good morning and thank you for joining us for AGCO's Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. On the call with me this morning, we have: Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, we will refer to a slide presentation, which is posted on our website at The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the slides. We will make forward-looking statements, including some related to projections of earnings per share, sales, population growth, market demand and conditions, product offerings, margin and productivity improvement, plant idling, inventory management, working capital, free cash flow, exchange rates, production volumes, general economic conditions, pricing increases, farm incomes, grain consumption, capital expenditures, pension and benefit claim, costs and engineering and restructuring expense. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our website. I'd now like turn the call over to Martin. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Good morning, everybody. Thank you, Greg. Despite the severe global recession of 2009, the long-term drivers of our business remain intact. Growth in population, changing values and improved economies in developing nations are all leading to greater demand for food. Current estimates show that global grain consumption increased in 2009, demonstrating the power of these trends. We believe favorable farm economics will continue, providing farmers with an incentive to invest in farm equipment, that makes them more productive and more efficient. I'm pleased to tell you that AGCO responded to the difficult economic conditions and finished the year solidly profitable and with a stronger balance sheet. Our disciplined inventory reduction program cut company and dealer inventories by more than $550 million on a constant-currency basis compared to December 2008 levels. Slide 3 shows AGCO's results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. Our fourth quarter sales were down approximately 14% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and therefore[ph], result the impact of currency, primarily due to weaker demand in Europe and North America, partially offset by improving conditions in South America. The volatility in commodity prices and the expectation of lower farm income contributed to a higher level of conservatism in farmer's equipment purchase decisions. End market demand continues to softened in Western Europe North America. Sales declined steeply in those markets during the fourth quarter. In Brazil however, a strong government support in the form of subsidized interest rates helped stabilize the market. In the first quarter of 2009, sales declines, lower production volumes and weaker mix of products compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, resulted in a drop in adjusted operating margins to 3.1%. Our production volumes for 2008 and 2009 are illustrated on Slide 4. Fourth quarter 2009 tractor and combine products, levels were down 23% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Softening global demand is evidenced in our order books, which have declined significantly from year end 2008 levels. Countries have backlog in Europe and North America is approximately half the level of the end of 2008. In South America, the order book [ph] is up considerably from year end 2008 levels. We made good progress in lagging inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. However, we will make further production cuts in early 2010 in response to the weak demand in some of our markets. Our first quarter 2010 production of tractors and combines is expected to be down approximately 20% from 2009 levels. We will make deeper cuts in Europe and North America and increase production, at the same time, in South America. We are idling some of our plants during the first quarter to further reduce inventory levels. These actions will significantly impact our first quarter 2010 sales and earnings. For the full year of 2010, we are expecting tractor and combine production to be down 3% to 5%. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes per region for the full year of 2009. Industry tractor sales in North America were down 21% compared to 2008 levels. The most significant declines occurred in the sub-100 horsepower tractor segment, which are closely tied to the weak residential construction, dairy and livestock production areas. Road tractors were also down from last year's robust levels. The combine market grew approximately 50% during the full year of 2009 compared to 2008. The sales of high horsepower tractors and combines into the professional producer sector weakened in the fourth quarter, as the late harvest added to farmer conservatism. AGCO's total unit sales of tractors and combines in the full year 2009 were both down from 2008 levels. Industry unit retail sales in Western Europe weakened further in the fourth quarter. Industry sales were down 20% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. The 20% decline in the fourth quarter of 2009 compares to a decline of 12% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. European demand were softest in the credit-challenged markets of East and in Central Europe and Russia. Our intake across Europe remains weak. We are projecting softness in the Western European markets through the first half of 2010. South American industry retail tractor volumes decreased approximately by 70% during the full year of 2009 compared to 2008. Route [ph] combinations and limited credit availability in Argentina contributed to a decline of approximately 61% in Argentine retail tractor volumes. The decline in Argentina were partially offset by growth in Brazil of approximately 5% for the full year of 2009 compared to 2008. A Brazilian government financing plant for small farms and low interest rate program launched in July, covering all equipment, helped to stabilize the Brazilian market. In South America, we are expecting improved market conditions in the first half of 2010 compared to the first half of 2009. And we will now provide you with some more details of our fourth quarter results, Andy Beck. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin. Turning to Slide 6, AGCO's regional net sales performance for 2009 is outlined. Currency translation had a positive impact of approximately 10% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of 2009. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales decline of approximately 27%, excluding the impact of currency, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales declines in France and Germany contributed to the Western European decline. AGCO sales in Eastern and Central Europe and Russia continued to be very weak. North American net sales were down approximately 42% during the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Destocking initiatives and softer end market demand in the dairy and cattle producer segments contributed to the decline. Hay tool, high horsepower tractors and sprayers showed the most weakness. AGCO's fourth quarter 2009 net sales in South America increased approximately 4% from 2008 levels, excluding currency. The low interest financing program offered by the Brazilian government in July produced strong growth in AGCO's fourth quarter sales in Brazil compared to 2008. Improved demand in Brazil was partially offset by continued weakness in the Argentina market. Net sales in our Asia/Pacific segment grew approximately 62% in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to 2008, excluding the impact of currency. The improved sales in Asia drove most of the growth. Part sales were $225 million for the fourth quarter of 2009 and $939.9 million for the full year of 2009, which was a decline of approximately 5% for both the quarter and full year, compared to the same periods in 2008, excluding currency. Slide 7 reviews AGCO's sales and margin performance. Gross margins were down approximately 300 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Lower production volumes in North America and Europe were partially offset by margin improvements in South America. Adjusted operating margins were 3.5% for the full year of 2009. The decline in operating margins resulted from weaker sales, lower gross margins and higher engineering expenses, as a percentage of net sales. Operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region declined significantly for the full year of 2009, compared to the same period in 2008. Weaker sales, lower production volumes and increased engineering expenses focused on our high-horsepower tractors and new harvesting products contributed to the margin compression. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating income declined due to lower sales, production cuts and inventory-reduction initiatives. In the South America regions, operating margins declined approximately 343 basis points for the full year of 2009 compared to 2008. Softer market demand produced lower sales and the shift in mix of products towards smaller, lower margin tractors also contributed to the decline. Operating margins did increase sequentially in South America during the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the third quarter. Stronger market demand, a richer product mix and improved factory absorption had produced the increase. For the full year of 2009, operating income in North America segment more than doubled and operating margins improved to 1.5%, despite a 20% decline in sales. AGCO's results in North America benefited from improved margins from new products, productivity initiatives and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher engineering costs and the impact of lower production. In the fourth quarter of 2009, operating income declined in North America due to the significant drop in sales, production cuts and dealer destocking. Slide 8 details our progress with inventory reduction initiatives. Despite the softening demand throughout the year, we were able to reduce inventory and accounts receivable at year end by over $550 million on a constant-currency basis from 2008 year end levels. As Martin mentioned, we will idle plants in the first quarter of 2010 to address these opportunities. We're also planning a lower use of seasoned working capital during 2010, by reducing the build of dealer and company inventory required for the spring season. At the end of December 2009, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was lower in all categories at the same time a year ago. We still have work to do, especially in the area of hay equipment. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: Tractors were at 4.5 months, combines at 2.5 months, hey equipment at 6.5 months. Other working capital details are as follows: On December 22, 2009, we terminated and replaced our U.S. and Canadian accounts receivable securitization facilities, which totaled $350 million with new sales agreements that allow for the transfer of the majority of our wholesale receivables in North America to AGCO finance, which is our 49%-owned retail finance joint venture. This is on an ongoing basis. This change generated approximately $41 million of cash flow, which is included in our free cash flow analysis on Slide 9. At December 31, 2009, we had accounts receivable securitization facility still in Europe, with outstanding funding of approximately $149.9 million. Losses on sales receivables, primarily under our securitization facilities which is included in other expense net, was approximately $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $5.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. The benefit of our working capital reduction initiatives can be seen on the slide, AGCO's the fourth quarter cash flow of $448 million we generated largely from working capital reduction. The significant production cuts made during 2009 resulted in lower accounts payables which limited the benefit for the full year in working capital and cash flow. With a net debt position near zero at year end 2009, we planned to continue investing for future growth in a form of engineering expense and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting free cash flow in the $75 million to $100 million range during 2010. Slide 10 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. We've slowed the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products during the year in response to softening market conditions. Looking ahead to 2010, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet the Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in both China and Russia. Slide 11 shifts our focus to assumptions underlying our 2010 outlook. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for industry in our business. Our strategies are aimed at helping AGCO grow profitably in this environment. However, the weak demand in Europe and North America creates uncertainty around the market conditions we will face in 2010. Our outlook for 2010 has not changed since we spoke in December. It anticipates declines in Western Europe and North America markets and modest growth in South America. Our 2010 forecast assumes pricing increases of 2½% to 3% on a consolidated basis. In 2010, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4's emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 20% or $40 million. We also look for our productivity in purchasing initiatives to drive improved margins. The impact of our pension and post-retirement benefit plans is expected to increase expenses by approximately $9 million. Slide 12 list our view of selected 2010 financial goals. We're projecting 2010 sales to range from $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion or roughly flat with 2009. We expect forecasted pricing benefits and market share improvements will offset the softer market demand. Our forecast for 2010 diluted earnings per share ranges from $1.55 to $1.65. We expect gross margins improvement to be offset by higher engineering and pension costs. In the seasonally low first quarter 2010, tightened dealer inventory in North America and Europe is expected to drive lower production and sales levels and result in an adjusted net loss of $0.10 to $0.15 per share. These earnings per share projections, exclude restructuring expenses expected to be incurred in the company's European operations, estimated at approximately $0.10 per share for the full year of 2010. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'd like to open it up for question and answers."

On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. AGCO finished 2010 with a very strong fourth quarter. After focusing on working capital reductions early in the year, our European and North American businesses, both, led the way on sales growth and margin improvement in the fourth quarter. We took advantage of improving market conditions in Europe and posted fourth quarter sales growth of nearly 30% on a constant-currency basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter operating margins in our Europe, Africa, Middle East regions rebounded to 9.5%, up nearly 500 basis points from the third quarter of 2010 and nearly 600 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009. In North America, the economics for row crop farmers continued to be outstanding and the market demand for large equipment remains robust. We capitalized on industry conditions and grew sales in North America, up 47% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of currency translation. North American operating margins exceeded 7% in the fourth quarter, the highest level in 10 years. Commodity prices remain at very high levels, a positive sign for farm income and farmer sentiment in 2011. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010. AGCO sales improved approximately 19% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Stronger sales and higher levels of production generated 350 basis points of improvement in fourth quarter operating margins compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $0.88 exceeded our guidance due to higher-than-anticipated operating margins. In addition, we managed working capital very closely as we ended the year, and our strong operating performance translated into over $270 million of free cash flow for the full year of 2010. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2009 and 2010 are illustrated on Slide 4. AGCO's fourth quarter 2010 tractor and combine production was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Improving order flow along with increased production levels in our North American and European factories were offset by lower production volumes in South America. European production was up approximately 25%, and North American production was up approximately 6% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to prior year. South American production decreased approximately 19% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 as a result of softening market demand. Strengthening demand in Europe doubled AGCO's order board for the EAME markets at the end of December 2010 compared to the very weak level at the end of December 2009. Equipment order boards in North America were also up significantly from December 2009 levels. South American order boards remained strong but were down significantly from very high levels at the end of December 2009. In 2011, we expect production volumes to be relatively flat compared to 2010. Higher production volumes in Europe and North America are expected to be offset by lower levels of production in our South American factories. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the full year of 2010. Industry tractor sales in North America were up modestly compared to 2009 levels. In North America, the High Horsepower segment benefited from favorable row crop economies mix and increased 18% compared to the full year of 2009. Industry sales were up modestly in compact tractors and declined in utility tractors sector compared to the full year of 2009. The combine market grew approximately 9% during the full year of 2010 compared to the strong levels in 2009. AGCO's total unit sales of combines in the full year of 2010 increased while tractors declined from 2009 levels. Industry unit retail sales in Western Europe improved in the fourth quarter compared to the weak level from the fourth quarter of 2010. Industry sales were down approximately 10% in the full year of 2010 compared to the same period of 2009. Slower recovery of the general economy, weak farmer sentiment and softness in the dairy and livestock sectors all contributed to the decline. Demand was softest in France, Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom. South American industry tractor volumes increased approximately 31% during the full year of 2010 compared to relatively weak 2009. Strong crop production in Brazil, an attractive financing program supported by the government, contributed to strong market demand. Better harvest in Argentina resulted in market growth of 74% in the full year of 2010 compared to the drought-impacted volumes in the full year of 2009. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our fourth quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone. AGCO's regional net sales performance for 2010 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of nearly 5% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of 2010. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 29%, excluding the impact of currency translation, during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Sales increased in nearly every market across Europe in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The most significant improvements occurred in Germany, France and Finland. North American net sales increased approximately 47%, excluding currency translation impacts, during the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. With our dealer inventory destocking efforts complete, sales of sprayers, high horse power tractors and combines all showed improvement in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. AGCO's fourth quarter 2010 net sales in South America increased approximately 1% compared to 2009 levels, excluding currency. AGCO's fourth quarter sales in Argentina more than doubled compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Improved crop production and increased credit availability contributed to the markets' strength in Argentina. Softening market conditions in Brazil in the fourth quarter of 2010 offset most of the strong growth in Argentina. Net sales in our Rest of the World segment decreased approximately 16% in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009, excluding the impact of currency translation. Lower sales in Australia and New Zealand were partially offset by improved sales in Eastern Europe and Russia. Part sales were $258.7 million and $1 billion for the fourth quarter and full year of 2010, an increase of approximately 17% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year of 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 7 details AGCO sales and margin performance. Operating margins were up approximately 350 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The benefit of increased production volumes and a richer mix of products was partially offset by increased expenditures for engineering and other initiatives. As Martin mentioned earlier, fourth quarter 2010 operating margins in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region were 9.5%, up significantly both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Margins were improved in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to higher sales and production volumes and a richer mix of products, partially mitigated by increased engineering expenditures. In the South American region, operating margins declined in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to 2009. A weaker geographic mix and lower levels of production and higher expenses contributed to the decline. In the fourth quarter and the full year 2010, operating margins improved in North America, both due to higher sales and production. As you know, North American profitability has been one of our main focus areas for the last few years. You can see from the graph on Slide 8 that we have made progress. In 2010, margins improved 180 basis points compared to 2009 on relatively flat sales. We have introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered our logistics costs and improved the efficiency of our factories. We realize that we have more work to do and target additional margin improvement in 2011. Slide 9 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. As a result of strong cash flow for the full year of 2010, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of December 2010 remains strong. In 2010, we made investments for future growth in the form of engineering expenses and initiatives for productivity in our plants and new products. During December 2010, we expanded our high margin replacement parts business with the purchase of Sparex Holdings, Ltd. in Europe. In early 2011, we will close on two previously announced acquisitions, which will bolster our European combine business and provide advanced air-seeding products to our distribution network. AGCO's strong financial position and ability to generate cash will allow us to increase our strategic investments in 2011. Our working capital management continues to make progress. AGCO's company and dealer inventories were at or near targeted levels across all regions. At the end of December 2010, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12 months basis was lower for combines, flat for tractors and hay equipment compared to the same time a year ago. Our dealer month supply in North America was as follows: tractors, 4.9 months; combines, 2.3 months; and hay equipment, seven months. Our other working capital details are as follows: losses on sales of receivables, which is included in both interest expense net and other expense net, or approximately $4.6 million and $16.1 million during the fourth quarter and full year of 2010 compared to $3.8 million and $15.6 million for the same periods in 2009. Slide 10 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. We deferred the startup of some of our plant productivity projects in response to softer market conditions in Europe. In 2011, we expect to increase our capital expenditures as we work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, improve our factory productivity in Germany and make investments in China and in Russia. Slide 11 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2011 outlook. We are optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for our industry and our business, and our strategies are aimed at helping grow AGCO profitably in this environment. In 2011, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or $30 million. We also look for new products, improved productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. For 2011, our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with new market expansion. Slide 12 lists our view of selected 2011 financial goals. We are projecting 2011 sales to increase 10% to 15% from 2010 levels. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvements, the positive impact of currency and acquisition impacts are all expected to contribute to the growth. Including significant investments in product development and market development, we expect 2011 earnings to be improved from 2010 levels. Our target for 2011 earnings per share ranges from $2.50 to $2.75 per share. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $250 million to $300 million range and our free cash flow to remain positive in the $100 million range after funding the expected increases in capital expenditures. In the seasonally low first quarter of 2011, net sales are expected to range from $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and earnings per share in the $0.25 to $0.30 range. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we're now ready to take questions."

We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this morning are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good morning to everyone. 2011 was a very good year for the global farm industry. Farmers made record levels of income and commodity prices reached and remained at attractive levels. AGCO took advantage of these positive conditions and delivered a year of strong sales growth and margin expansion in 2011 compared to 2010. AGCO's adjusted operating margins improved 225 basis points in the full year of 2011 compared to 2010. Gary Collar's Europe/Africa/Middle East business delivered exceptional performance. With industry demand below peak levels in Western Europe, our EAME region produced record sales on a constant currency basis and improved operating margins by over 400 basis points compared to 2010. In North America, we capitalized on healthy industry conditions, grew sales and improved margins. Bob Crain's North American business posted operating margins in excess of 5% for the full year of 2011, the best in over 10 years. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011. In the fourth quarter, we reported sales growth across all of our regions compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted earnings per share reached $1.44 for the fourth quarter, up 64% compared to a year ago. In addition, our strong operating performance translated into improved cash flow. AGCO's tractor and combine production volumes for 2010 and 2011 are illustrated on Slide 4. AGCO's fourth quarter 2011 tractor and combine production grew 8% compared to the same period in 2010. Higher volumes in our North American and European factories were partially offset by lower production levels in our South American region. AGCO's year-end order board remained well ahead of last year's levels in our EAME and North American markets. South American order boards remained strong and are about even with 2010 year-end levels. We expect production volumes for the full year of 2012 to be approximately 5% up versus 2011. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the full year of 2011. Industry tractor sales in North America were up modestly compared to 2010 levels. In North America, industry sales of utility tractors increased due to improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors. Sales of high horsepower tractors remained elevated and were up slightly from the strong levels in the full year of 2010. As expected, combine industry retail sales were lower in the fourth quarter and were down 4% for the full year of 2011 from the high levels experienced in 2010. Industry tractor unit retail sales in Western Europe were up approximately 12% in the full year of 2011 compared to the weak levels experienced in 2010. Higher commodity prices and improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors contributed to this increase. Industry growth was strongest in Germany, France, Scandinavia and Finland. South American industry retail sector volumes decreased modestly during the full year of 2011 compared to strong levels in the full year of 2010. Declines in Argentina and Brazil were mostly offset by strong growth in smaller South American markets. Despite the slight downturn in 2011, industry retail sales in Brazil were still the second highest in their history. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck, who will provide you more information on our fourth quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good morning. Before I cover the sales results, I will start with a quick overview of the GSI impacts on our fourth quarter. AGCO completed the acquisition of GSI on November 30, 2011, for a purchase price of $932 million. The transaction was financed through $300 million of senior notes and the remainder through our new credit facility. AGCO's fourth quarter reported results included a tax gain for a reversal of a valuation allowance against AGCO's net deferred tax assets, which was associated with the acquisition accounting for GSI of approximately $149.3 million, as well as some one-time acquisition expenses. The tax gain and acquisition expenses, a net impact of $1.46 to EPS, were excluded from the company's adjusted results. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of about 2% on AGCO's consolidated net sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. Acquisitions added approximately 5% to sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 15%, excluding the impact of currency during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. AGCO's sales increased in every major market across Western Europe in the fourth quarter of 2011. The most significant improvements occurred in the United Kingdom, France and Austria. North America net sales increased approximately 30%, excluding currency, during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010. Sales improved significantly across all major product categories in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. AGCO's fourth quarter net sales in South America grew 8% from comparable 2010 levels, excluding currency impacts. From a product perspective, sprayers, high horsepower tractors and combines generated the growth. Higher sales in Brazil and some smaller South American markets were offset by declines in Argentina. Net sales in our Rest of the World segment increased approximately 54% in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 2010, excluding the impact of currency. Sales growth in Russia, Eastern Europe and Australia produced most of the increase. Part sales were $293 million and $1.3 billion for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011, an increase of approximately 15% for the fourth quarter and 22% for the full year of 2011 compared to the same periods in 2010, excluding currency translations. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Adjusted operating margins were up about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The benefit of increased production volumes, pricing and leverage over operating expenses was partially offset by increased material costs and higher engineering and marketing expenses. Operating margins were highest in AGCO's Europe/Africa/Middle East region, where they surpassed 10% for both the quarter and the year. Margins improved nearly 100 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to higher sales and production volumes and cost controls. In the South America region, our operating margins expanded nearly 300 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to 2010. Improved sales volumes and a richer mix of products and geographic mix contributed to improved profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2011, operating margins in North America exceeded 7% due to higher sales and production, accelerated new product introductions, along with cost-control initiatives. Slide 8 shows the improvement in North America's profitability in more detail. Margins in this region have been one of our main focus over the last few years. You can see from the graph on this slide that we have made significant progress. For the full year of 2011, margins improved nearly 500 basis points on flat sales compared to the same period in 2008. We introduced profitable new products, reorganized our sales organization, lowered all logistics costs and improve the efficiency of our factories. We expect more North American margin improvement by growing our top line through additional new product introductions, improving our existing products and strengthening our distribution. We also expect to take more costs out of the business by improving our production and purchasing efficiency and by localizing more of our production. In January, we began assembling high horsepower tractors in Jackson, Minnesota for the North American market. This should eliminate some currency exposure and allow us to add the Made in America label. Slide 9 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. We increased the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products during the year to support our growth and margin ambitions. In 2012, we expect to further increase our capital expenditures as we continue to work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity, complete the expansion at Fendt and establish assembly capabilities in China and in Russia. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow, which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. AGCO's free cash flow for 2011, up $426 million, included a $127 million benefit associated with transferring our European wholesale receivables from a higher-cost, on-balance sheet securitization facility to our AGCO Finance joint venture. As a result of the strong free cash flow AGCO has generated over the past few years, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of 2011 remains strong. In 2012, we plan to continue investing for growth and profitability improvement in the form of engineering expenses and additional investments in our plants and new products. Even after covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting another solid year of free cash flow for 2012. At the end of 2011, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was as follows: tractors were 5.5 months; 3 months for combines; and 7 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows. Losses on sales of receivables, which is included in both interest expense net and other expense net were approximately $6.4 million and $22 million for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011, compared to $4.6 million and $16.1 million for the same periods of 2010. On December 1, 2011, AGCO entered into a new credit facility agreement providing for a $1 billion revolving credit and term loan facility. We used a portion of the credit facility to fund the acquisition of GSI. The new credit facility replaced our former $300 million revolving credit facility. Our regional market outlook for 2012 is captured on Slide 11. Our forecast anticipates relatively flat demand on a global basis. In North America, the strong financial position of row crop farmers and the expectation of farm income above historical averages is expected to support demand from the professional farming sector. We also look for improvement in the dairy and livestock sectors, which will help our hay equipment demand in 2012. In South America, we expect the elevated level of farm income in 2011 and the clarity around government financing programs to keep demand at relatively high levels in 2012. However, dry weather is impacting the first harvest in Southern Brazil and Argentina. We expect the dry conditions to result in a modest decline in industry demand compared to 2011. Healthy income for grain and dairy farmers in 2011 is expected to keep Western European demand strong in 2012. We are forecasting level demand in the Western European market. Better harvest in Russia and Eastern Europe in 2011 are expected to produce healthy growth in these markets in 2012. Slide 12 highlights the assumptions underlying our 2012 outlook. We are forecasting price increases of approximately 3.5% on a consolidated basis, offset by about 7% of negative currency translation impact. In 2012, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense of approximately 10% to 15%, or $30 million. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins. Our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with sites and manufacturing, start-up and market support costs amounting to $20 million for Fendt and $20 million to $25 million for our Chinese operations. We project the GSI acquisition will be accretive to 2012 earnings per share by about $0.45 per share. And the strengthening U.S. dollar is expected to negatively impact 2012 earnings per share by about $0.35 to $0.40, based on the current exchange rates. Slide 13 lists our view of selected 2012 financial goals. Our order boards remain strong, and we are projecting 2012 sales to exceed $10 billion, even with the headwinds provided by the weaker euro. Forecasted pricing benefits, market share improvements and acquisition impacts will partially be offset by the negative impact of currency. Including significant investments in new product development, market development and start-up costs associated with our manufacturing projects, we expect to continue to improve gross and operating margins from 2011 levels. Despite the additional currency pressure we're facing since we gave you our 2012 guidance in December, our target for 2012 earnings per share remains at approximately $5 per share. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $325 million to $350 million range and our free cash flow to exceed $200 million after funding the capital expenditures. The improvements we are making in our European factories will impact the timing of production and sales throughout 2012. The production schedule at our Valtra plant in Finland ramps up slowly in the first quarter, following the SAP system cutover on January 1 of this year. As a result, Valtra's first quarter production in Europe will be lower than the first quarter of 2011. With the timing of Valtra production, the impact of dry weather in South America, the negative impact of currency and start-up costs in our Chinese operations, we're expecting our first quarter earnings to be about flat to slightly up compared to the first quarter of 2011. We expect some of these timing issues to be recovered in the second quarter, which should be up versus 2011. That concludes our prepared remarks, operator. We're now ready to take questions."
23,GV_025180_2012Q4,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon. My name is Kimberly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the AGCO Corporation's 2012 Fourth Quarter Earnings Release and Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Greg Peterson, Head of Investor Relations. Greg Peterson Director of Investor Relations Thanks, Kimberly, and good afternoon. Welcome to those of you joining us on the call and over the Internet for AGCO's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We'd like to apologize for our technical difficulties this morning and any inconvenience that our delay may have caused you. We will refer to a slide presentation which is posted on the website. The non-GAAP measures used in the slide presentation are reconciled to GAAP measures in the last section of the presentation. We'll make forward-looking statements, including demand for our products and economic and other factors that drive that demand; product development plans and timing of those plans, acquisitions, expansion and modernization plans and our expectations with respect to the cost and benefits of those plans and timing of those benefits; and our future revenue, earnings and other financial metrics. We wish to caution you that these statements are predictions, that actual events may differ materially. We refer you to the periodic reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. These documents discuss important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements. A replay of this call will be available on our corporate website. On the call with me this afternoon are Martin Richenhagen, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Beck, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Martin, please go ahead. Martin H. Richenhagen Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon to everyone. 2012 was a very good year for the global farm industry despite unfavorable weather conditions in many of the world's important ag markets. In most cases, farmers made healthy levels of income and commodity prices remained at attractive levels. AGCO took advantage of these positive conditions and delivered a year of strong sales and earnings growth in 2012 compared to 2011. Slide 3 summarizes our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. Organic sales grew over 12% for the full year and adjusted earnings per share increased to $5.25, a record for AGCO. We also made significant upgrades to our product offerings and improvements to our manufacturing facilities. We continue to make solid progress with margins in both North and South America. For the full year of 2012, South American margins improved about 100 basis points and North American margins reached 10%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved sales growth across all of our regions compared to the same period in 2011 on a constant-currency basis. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.99. As expected, these results declined from the fourth quarter of 2011 as we managed the ramp up of production at Fendt, had lower Fendt sales and experienced additional startup costs associated with the new Fendt assembly facility. AGCO's forecast for tractor and combine production volumes for 2012 are illustrated on Slide 4. Fourth quarter 2012 production was down about 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Lower levels of production in North America and Europe were partially offset by increased activity in our South American factories. As you know, the Fendt production schedule in Germany was more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year to compensate for lower production during the fourth quarter as we brought the new assembly facility online. Our Marktoberdorf build rates have now returned to more normal levels. We also expect to see improving production efficiency and cost through the first half of 2013. AGCO's order boards at the end of December 2012 were approximately flat in North America, down in Europe and up significantly in South America compared to the end of 2011. We expect production volumes for the full year of 2013 to be about flat versus 2012. Slide 5 details industry unit volumes by region for the full year of 2012. In North America, industry sales grew across all categories of tractors. The strongest growth came from the high horsepower segment due to the healthy income levels of row crop farmers. The combine market was relatively flat compared to the elevated levels in the full year of 2011. Industry unit retail sales of tractors in Western Europe were down slightly for the full year of 2012. Growth in the key markets of France and Germany was offset by declines in Southern Europe due to dry weather and credit constraints and declines in Scandinavia and Finland due to wet weather and a late harvest. South American industry retail sector volumes increased modestly during 2012 compared to 2011. Improved demand in the second half of the year in Brazil overcame a slow first half. Favorable exchange rates improved further and attractive soft commodity prices have energized the market in South America. I will now turn the call over to Andy Beck who will provide you more information on our fourth quarter results. Andrew H. Beck Senior VP & CFO Thank you, Martin, and good afternoon. AGCO's regional net sales performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012 is outlined on Slide 6. Currency translation had a negative impact of about 4% on AGCO's consolidated net sales, and acquisitions added approximately 4% to the sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. The Europe/Africa/Middle East segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 4%, excluding the impact of currency translation during the fourth quarter 2012 compared to the fourth quarter 2011. The negative impact of Fendt's lower production, especially on German sales, was offset by growth in France and Russia. North American sales increased approximately 8%, excluding currency translation impacts during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the same period of 2011. The GSI acquisition accounted for most of the increase. AGCO's fourth quarter net sales in South America grew about 30% from comparable 2011 levels, excluding currency translation impacts. Higher sales in Brazil due to healthy farm fundamentals and attractive government financing plans accounted for most of the increase. Net sales in our Asia/ Pacific segment increased approximately 28% in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to 2011, excluding the impact of currency translation and the benefit of acquisitions. Sales growth in Australia and China produced most of the organic increase. Part sales were $295 million for the fourth quarter 2012, an increase of approximately 4% compared to the same period in 2011, excluding the impact of currency. Slide 7 details AGCO's sales and margin performance. Adjusted operating margins were down about 240 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Gross margins were negatively impacted by costs associated with the start-up and low production at the Fendt facility in the fourth quarter of 2012. The decline in gross margins was partially offset by positive net pricing. Operating margins were also negatively impacted by market development expenses. In Europe/Africa/ Middle East, operating margins were down about 400 basis points for the fourth quarter 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 due to lower production volumes, a weaker mix of products and the impact of the Fendt factory start-up costs. North American operating margins exceeded 8% in the fourth quarter of 2012 and exceeded 10% for the full year compared to the same period in 2011, including the benefit of GSI. Core margins were up significantly due to higher sales, a favorable sales mix and cost control initiatives. In the South American region, operating margins improved to 10% in the fourth quarter of 2012, up approximately 180 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Favorable exchange impacts, cost-reduction benefits and higher sales volumes produced the increase. Excluded from our adjusted results is a noncash intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $22.4 million related to the company's Chinese harvesting business, as mentioned in our earnings release. The development of our harvesting business in China will likely take longer than originally estimated. We are optimistic that the Chinese farm equipment market remains a significant opportunity for AGCO. In the second half of 2012, we started to feel the impacts of the U.S. drought on our grain storage and protein production businesses in North America. Slide 8 details GSI sales by region and by product for the full year of 2012. Despite the unfavorable second half conditions, GSI sales grew by about 3% in 2012 compared to pro forma 2011 sales. Strong growth in Asia was partially offset by a decline in North America. GSI contributed approximately $0.38 of earnings per share during the full year of 2012 and was diluted by about 12% in the fourth quarter. Slide 9 looks at our depreciation and capital expenditure trends. We increased the investment in some of our plant productivity projects and new products during 2012 to support our growth and margin ambitions. Looking ahead to 2013, we expect to further increase our CapEx, as we continue to work to meet Tier 4 emissions requirements, refresh and expand our product line, upgrade our system capabilities, improve our factory productivity and establish assembly capabilities in China. Slide 10 addresses AGCO's free cash flow which represents cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. As a result of the strong free cash flow AGCO had generated over the last few years, our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of 2012 remains strong. In 2013, we plan to continue investing for growth and profitability improvement and additional investments in our plants and new products. After covering increased spending on these strategic investments, we are targeting another year of solid free cash flow for 2013. At the end of December 2012, our North America dealer month supply on a trailing 12-month basis was approximately 5 months for tractors, 3 months for combines and 7 months for hay equipment. Other working capital details are as follows. Losses on sales receivables associated with receivable financing facilities, which is included in other expense net, was approximately $5.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $6.4 million in the same period of 2011. Shifting focus to AGCO's financial management, Slide 11 shows how our net debt to total capital remains at very conservative levels even after adding the debt associated with the GSI acquisition completed late in 2011. In 2012, we reduced our debt by approximately $200 million and going forward, we look to maintain our conservative balance sheet and investment-grade rating as we begin to return cash to shareholders. With a healthy balance sheet and improved U.S. cash flow generation capacity, AGCO took the first step in returning cash to shareholders during July when our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase [indiscernible] repurchased $18 million of its common stock during 2012. The primary purpose of the new program is to limit dilution resulting from our equity incentive plans. We took the next step last month when we announced the initiation of a $0.10 quarterly dividend which will be paid in March of this year for the first time. Our outlook for 2013 for our regional markets is captured on Slide 13 and has not changed since we first communicated it to you during our analyst meeting in December. We're anticipating relatively flat demand on a global basis. In North America, the strong financial position of row crop farmers and the expectation of farm income above historical averages should support healthy demand from the professional farming sector. Strong farm fundamentals are expected to continue in Brazil in 2013 and clarity around government financing programs are expected to stimulate growth between 5% and 10% compared to the levels in 2012. We are expecting a mixed demand pattern in Western Europe, with weakness in Northern Europe due to the lingering impacts of a wet Fall and continued softness in Southern Europe due to tight credit and dry weather. Solid demand across some of the larger European markets is expected to offset most of the decline in Northern and Southern Europe. We are currently forecasting 2013 demand in Western Europe to be flat to down 5% compared to 2012. Slide 14 highlights assumptions underlying our 2013 outlook. Our forecast assumes price increases ranging from 2.5% to 3% on a consolidated basis and we expect the impact of currency to be approximately neutral. In 2013, expenditures on new product development and Tier 4 emissions requirements will cause an increase in engineering expense by approximately 10% to 15% or about $40 million. We also look for new products in our productivity and purchasing initiatives to drive improved gross margins for next year. For 2013, our SG&A expense will include expenses associated with site and manufacturing start-up and market support cost amounting to about $10 million for our Chinese operations. We mentioned at our analyst meeting in December that the recognition of certain U.S. deferred tax assets was under review. We did make a change in the fourth quarter of 2012 which resulted in a write-up of our deferred tax assets due to improved profitability of our North America business. Subsequent to the write- up, our effective tax rate will increase in 2013. However, our U.S. cash taxes will remain lower through at least 2013. We are now forecasting an effective tax rate of between 32% and 34% for 2013. Slide 15 lists our view of selected 2013 financial goals. We are expecting 2013 sales in the range of $10.2 billion to $10.4 billion. We expect it to continue to improve gross and operating margins from 2012 levels, including significant investments and product development, market development and startup costs associated with our manufacturing projects. We expect increased capital expenditures to be in the $400 million to $425 million range and free cash flow in the $125 million to $150 million range after funding the expected increase in capital expenditures and higher inventory levels associated with Tier 4 product transition. Slide 16 lists our updated view for 2013 earnings per share. The only change from our December analyst meeting is the negative impact of the new higher effective tax rate, which we are currently estimating at about $0.40 per share. We are now forecasting earnings per share in a range from $5.10 to $5.35 per share. In 2013, we expect more normal seasonality for our production and our sales. As a result, our forecast assumes first quarter and second quarter sales will be approximately flat with the same periods in 2012, and we are projecting first quarter earnings per share of approximately $0.85 per share. With that, operator, we are ready to open the call for questions."
24,GV_001837_2008Q1,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2008 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lauren, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Steve Cave, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Steve Cave Thank you, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter 2008 earnings results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several other members of our management team here with us to answer questions following the prepared remarks. As you know, we issued our earnings release yesterday. We also filed our Form 10-Q this morning. If you don't have those already, you can find copies of those documents on our website. We also have a slide presentation at the company's webcast just to provide a summary of some of the key highlights for the quarter. Moving now onto the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking statements. The various factors that could cause that material difference are included in our press release and our 10-Q and are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filings. We also use some non-GAAP measures in describing our business, and reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings as well as our website. We will begin today's call with some prepared remarks and then we will open up the lines to take your questions. And with that let me turn it over to John. John W. Somerhalder II Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. We had the chance to see a number of you at our analyst conference in early April and look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming AGA Financial Forum this weekend. So Drew and I will keep our comments brief today and just hit the highlights for the quarter and briefly describe our outlook for the year. Yesterday, we reported earnings of $1.17 per basic share, which is more consistent with the results you would expect given the current set of economic and market conditions that we discussed with you at the analyst conference. Further, as discussed during the analyst conference, these results for first quarter 2008 were in line with Drew's comment that we were expecting that current year first quarter to be roughly $0.15 below last year's reported first quarter. Adjusting for changes in the value of our hedge positions at Sequent, which resulted in current period unrealized losses of $15 million or approximately $0.12 impact to earnings per share. Our reported results would have been in the range of $1.29 per share. Drew will walk through those changes in more detail in a minute, but I think it's important to note that Sequent had a strong quarter in terms of generating significant economic value and the majority of that value was not realized in the first quarter but is expected to be realized later in the year. On the retail side, SouthStar's performance for the first quarter of 2008 was not as strong as it was during last year's first quarter. SouthStar's lower results were mainly driven by the increase in commodity prices throughout the first quarter and lower opportunities to optimize storage and transportation assets relative to last year. Given last year's very strong conditions and performance in the first quarter, we had expected lower earnings from SouthStar in the first quarter of this year and had already projected a majority of the lower earnings that we actually experienced when we established guidance for 2008. Our utility business results were flat year-over-year. We continue to make progress in reducing our customer attrition levels, but were challenged on the growth side by the slowdown of the economy and turbulent real estate market that lowered our customer growth rate below our expectations. The good news is we were able to hold our expenses flat to the business as compared to the prior-year period. As I mentioned earlier, Sequent is off to a good start from an economic value standpoint, and we believe that business is well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities throughout the year in addition to realizing in future periods the economic value that has already been generated during the first quarter. Also, we continue to see strong contributions from our energy investment segment, including better results from the Jefferson Island Storage facility as well as from AGL Networks. And finally, we continue to focus on actively managing our interest rate exposure and building on our long history of reducing costs in each of our businesses. We have actively managing both interest and O&M cost throughout our businesses and see upside in both of those areas. Our guidance range for the year remains at $2.75 to $2.85 per share. Longer-term we have described for you what we think is a very good set of opportunities to develop storage and pipeline infrastructure and we have made significant progress related to these growth projects. With respect to the Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas, we will hold the groundbreaking ceremonies next week to begin construction on this important project. This is the first of several key milestones during the construction phase of this $265 million project. The project is on schedule and on budget. We also will be breaking ground on the Hampton Roads Crossing project, the HRX project, in Virginia later in the month. This project… it will help with supply diversity for natural gas in Virginia and it also will provide important service for two anchor third-party utilities and will generate solid returns for us. We continue to move forward on the Magnolia project and that will help us move additional volumes from Elba Island into the metro Atlanta area. We expect FERC action on that project any day now. We’ve spoken with most of you about Jefferson Island and the lawsuits we have filed there. The only thing I would add at this time is that we continue to believe the environment is right there for some type of settlement and those discussions continue to occur. We remain optimistic that we can get the project back on track and we will certainly let you know of any new developments over the next several months. With that, I will turn it to Drew for the financial discussion. Andrew W. Evans Thanks, John, and good morning everybody. I think John covered the basis pretty well on distribution in terms of the largest drivers, which are customer growth and attrition and the continued focus on managing expenses. I won't walk through all the distinct offsetting factors that get you to the flat year- over-year results, but you can certainly call Steve and walk through those if you like. Before I talk about SouthStar and Sequent, you should understand one macro economic factor that has a significant impact on reported earnings. Unique to the last three years, gas prices rose steadily throughout the quarter in 2008. In SouthStar, this produced some lost opportunity relative to previous years. In Sequent, it will affect only the reporting of the value of our hedges, but has no impact on our reported inventory valuations. Despite these accounting changes, the underlying economic margin expected from the initial injections remains unchanged. Continued increases in prices as we have experienced since the end of the first quarter will continue this impact, but could just as easily reverse itself. On a net basis, Sequent is carrying roughly 11 bcf of storage. So $1 change in NYMEX could affect reported earnings by as much as $11 million. At SouthStar, John talked about how the cost of gas and rising commodity prices were the major drivers there. And the overall impact of that issue led to a $16 million decline in operating margin for the first quarter relative to last year. The remaining $5 million decline in operating margin was a result of two items, lower margins in Ohio and Florida markets of about $2 million and a settlement of $2.5 million we consented to during the first quarter this year with the Georgia Public Service Commission to settle an issue related to retail pricing in Georgia. Please remember that SouthStar had earnings that were $9 million in 2007 than in the previous year. Operating expenses at SouthStar were up a couple of million dollars due to slightly higher bad debt expense and increased marketing and direct sales costs. As John pointed out, Sequent had a stronger year-over-year commercial activity, stronger by about $5 million. That positions the business very well going into the remainder of the year. What you see in our reported GAAP results reflects the accounting impacts of the increase in forward NYMEX gas prices and the widening of future locational spreads, as these changes affect the underlying value of our storage and transportation hedges. But in reference to the former, we make no adjustments to the inventory that backstops the NYMEX hedges. Last year in the first quarter, we had GAAP reported storage hedge losses of $6 million and recorded no significant losses on transportation hedges. This year, we reported losses of $11 million on storage hedges and $4 million on transportation hedges. So we reported an additional $9 million in hedge losses as compared to last year, resulting in a reduction in reported operating margin of $4 million year-over- year when combined with the $5 million increase in underlying commercial activity. Sequent's operating expenses were up $4 million for the quarter and that was mainly due to higher payroll and other operating costs as we continued to expand the business model including our acquisition of Compass Energy, a commercial industrial marker, which was completed in 2007. The inventory rollout schedule on page 22 of the 10-Q gives you a good view of our expected timing for realization of future economic value of Sequent's portfolio that has not yet been realized in reported results. You can see we anticipate about $18 million in operating revenues to be realized over the next three quarters compared to about $15 million last year at this time. Although it’s [inaudible] change with changes in forward prices and Sequent's response to capture additional market opportunities, I think it demonstrate the longer-term value generation potential of this business. It's also important to note that Sequent's sales volumes in the first quarter of 2008 were up 12% over the prior-year period, again reinforcing the significant growth we have seen in that business. Turning to energy investments, we had good results in this segment with operating margins up $2 million due to higher interruptible and firm revenues at Jefferson Island storage facility and higher revenues from AGL Networks… the AGL Networks business due to network expansion projects. Operating expenses declined $1 million because of lower business development expense and that's because we are capitalizing our cost for the Golden Triangle project after receiving the FERC permit at the end of the year. That covers the highlights of the operating segments. And with that, we can take your questions. Question and Answer"
25,GV_001837_2009Q1,"Presentation Operator Good day, and welcome to the First Quarter 2009 AGL Resources Earning Conference Call. My name is Candace and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After management's remarks, we will conduct a Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) And a coordinator will be happy to assist you. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host, Mr. Steven Cave, Managing Director, Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed. Steven Cave Okay. Thank you, Candace, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our first quarter 2009 results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO, Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. As always, we have several other members of our management team here with us to answer questions following the prepared remarks. As you know we issued our earnings release and filed our Form 10-Q this morning, before the market open. If you don't have copies of those documents, you can find those on our website. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that we will be making some forward- looking statements today as part of our presentation and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The various factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and in our 10-Q and are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filing. We also used non-GAAP measures in describing our business and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financial is available measures is available in our earnings release and SEC filings and on our Web site. So we'll begin today's call with some prepared remarks, and then we'll open the line to take your questions. And with that I'll turn it over to John. John Somerhalder Thanks Steve and good afternoon. We had the change to see many of you at our Analyst Meeting just a couple of weeks ago. And look forward to seeing some of you at the AGL financial form this weekend. We'll keep our comments brief today and just focus on the highlights and the major variances year-over-year. Today we reported earnings of $1.55 per diluted share for the quarter compared to $1.16 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008. We had very good performance during the quarter from our utilities as well as from our wholesale and retail businesses, and these results position us well for the balance of the year. Let me just summarize a few of the key points for the quarter before I turn it over to Drew for the financial highlights. First sequence stands out as one of the headlines for the quarter, with significant gains on the storage and transportation hedges relative to the same period last year. Sequence has continued to see strong commercial activity, and we feel good about how we started the year and how it positions us for the remainder of the year. It is important to realize, however, that because a portion of the first quarter earnings are related to the hedges on our transportation capacity. Our reported results could experience some volatility associated with those hedges over the next few quarters, as market prices continue to fluctuate. The bottom line is that as we discussed at the analyst meeting, we still are projecting the wholesale services segment to be in the $45 million EBIT range, and that's the same range that we discussed a couple of weeks ago at the analyst meeting. Our utility continues to focus on the fundamentals through affected cost reduction and aggressive management of our controllable expenses. That includes bad debt expense, which remains consistent with our expectations. We also saw some uplift from the storage carrying charges paid to Atlanta gaslight by the marketers in Georgia particularly as flowing gas prices declined significantly and marketers continue to hold higher levels of inventory in storage during the period. Higher pipeline replacement revenues in Georgia was another significant driver of results for the quarter relative to last year. Importantly, as we discussed in our analyst meeting, we are focused on executing our regulatory strategy to ensure recovery of our infrastructure investments, and our other prudently incurred expenses. We are well underway with our rate case in New Jersey. We are still early in the process and mainly responding to data requests, but we will have more detail to share with you on that case a little later in the year. We have some positive news in New Jersey. In just a couple of days after our analyst meeting and that's related to our utility infrastructure enhancement filing, you may recall, along with the other utilities in New Jersey, that we filed a proposal to accelerate to replacement of some pipeline infrastructure in our service area over a two-year period. That was in response to governor Corzine's request that utility support his economic stimulus plan for the state. The New Jersey Board of public utilities approved our proposal on April 16. We will essentially be accelerating about $60 million of infrastructure projects between now and April 01, 2011. These are projects we already had planned to complete over a longer time horizon, but accelerating these investments will help us the state's economy by creating bout 65 new jobs. We will recover the cost of these investments in the near term through our cost recovery rider on customers' monthly bills; and in the longer term, we expect them to be rolled into our rate base as part of our normal rate making process. Turning to SouthStar, we saw improved results there year-over-year, as we saw improvements in the Ohio and Florida markets. We continue to see increase competition in the Georgia market for more active customer price shopping and the move toward lower margin fixed price plans. And Drew will discuss that impact in more detail in a minute. As I said at the analyst meeting, we continue to make very good progress towards completion of our utility and non-utility capital projects, including Golden Triangle Storage in Texas, Hampton Road Crossing in Virginia and the Magnolia project in Georgia. I won't spend much more time on those unless you have specific questions. We believe these results put us in a very strong position to be able to achieve our earnings guidance for 2009, which is in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share. With that, I will turn it to Drew for the financial discussion. Andrew Evans Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to cover a few of the major segment variances for the quarter, and then we can go into your questions. In the distribution segment, operating margin was $4 million better than last year. And as John said, two of the main drivers there were gas storage carrying costs and pipeline replacement revenues. Gas storage carrying costs were $3 million higher than in the first quarter of last year, and pipeline replacement revenue was up about $2 million. Also we had customer growth in Virginia and New Jersey as compared to last year, but this was offset by lower customer growth in Atlanta Gas Light and lower customer usage in New Jersey and Tennessee. On a consolidated basis our utility customer growth was just slightly negative, down 3,000 customers year-over-year on a total base of about 2.3 million. Operating expenses and distribution were down $2 million from last year, and that was largely a function of tighter control and outside services and other costs. I just want to point out that this savings is significant given the fact that we're face with higher depreciation, pension expense this year that we talked about with you in the last couple of months. To John's earlier point, we continue to monitor bad debt expense closely, but to date we have not seen any trends that are out the range of our expectations. Also in our utility business, we have very little sensitivity to the downturn in the industrial sector, as only about 5% of our total utility margin has generated from industrial customers across our six utilities. I want to make this point, as I know many of you are tracking this trend closely, and it's important to keep in mind that we have very little exposure relative to some of the others in the LDC sector. In the retail segment, there are several moving parts that met out to a slight improvement in operating margin relative to last year. We saw improved margin in Ohio and Florida about $3 million higher than last year. In Georgia, we had a significant improvement of about $14 million in margin from decreasing commodity prices and higher customer usage. But that was offset by $12 million decline in our margin, from lower customer account change in our customer mix amongst our retail pricing plans. Average customer count during the first quarter was down about 3% relative to last year, which is largely due to a more competitive market that we've been seeing in Georgia more recently. We also have continue to see a trend of customers more aggressively shopping for competitive pricing plans and moving more toward fixed price plans. These are plans that are typically lower-margin plans for SouthStar. We also marked our inventory down to market as required by GAAP, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which will show up as lower cost of goods sold in future periods. In the wholesale services segment, as John pointed out, we had a significant improvement in year-over- year results, and that largely reflects hedge gains on our transportation and storage positions, as 9X gas prices declined and transportation basis spreads narrowed during this period. These positives were offset by an $8 million lower or cost of market inventory adjustment during the period as gas prices declined relative to our weighted average inventory costs. Underlying these moving parts is a 15% increase in commercial activity year-over-year, very positive out come. You can see the specific components of operating margin for wholesale on page 30 of the 10-Q. Operating expenses at the wholesale segment were up $7 million relative to last year. That's largely a function of loans accrual at the segment, which is problematic based on earnings and results. Turning to the energy investment segment, EBIT was down $3 million in the first quarter relative to the prior-year period. That decrease reflects just slightly lower operating margins for the Jefferson Island Storage in AGL Networks, as well as higher operating expenses related to legal costs at Jefferson Island and higher property tax and depreciation expense for Golden Triangle. Two other items that I'd like to focus on are pension and liquidity. As we disclosed in the 10-Q, we made a pension contribution of $14 million for the first quarter of 2009 and expect to make additional contributions of $18 million in this year, for a total of $32 million. We previously had expected to make up to $68 million in pension contributions this year. That's what we talked about in our year-end call. However, the IRS pension relief granted earlier this year lowered our expected contributions as it resulted in the use of a discount rate that was higher than what we had in our previous estimate. So as a result, our funding requirements to maintain current benefit levels are lower than we had originally anticipated. With respect to credit and liquidity, we continue to pay down short-term debt during the first quarter, as inventories liquidated and receivables are collected. We have no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility as of the end of the first quarter. Our outstanding commercial paper borrowings at the end of the quarter were about $335 million. We'll continue to build inventory on behalf of our utility customers, but we're doing it at prices now that are one-third of what they were last year. This is certainly good for our liquidity and good for our customers. We continue to have good excess to the commercial paper markets and continue to be comfortable with our liquidity for the balance of 2009. Those are the major drivers for the quarter we're enthusiastic about our performance so far in a strong start to the year. With respect to guidance, I would just like to add to John's comments that we prefer to stay a bit conservative when we've only got one quarter behind us. You may have seen others in our space that have made adjustment to guidance recently, but keep in mind that some of them are six months into their fiscal year rather than three, like we are, and they have full winter seasons built into their results already. With that, we'll go to your questions."
26,GV_001837_2010Q1,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the first quarter 2010 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melanie and I will be your coordinator today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session at the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Cave, Vice President of Finance. Please proceed sir. Steve Cave Okay thank you Melanie and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our first quarter 2010 results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President, and CEO and Drew Evans our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several other members of our management team here with us to answer questions following the prepared remarks. As you know, we issued our earnings release before the market opened this morning, we also filed our Form 10-Q. If you don't have copies of those already you can find those on our website. And before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that we will be making some forward looking statements and projections today. And that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the statements. The are number of factors that could cause such material difference are those are included in our press released and in our SEC filings. We also described our business using some non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in our earnings release and on the website. So we'll begin today's call with some prepared remarks and then we'll open the lines to take your questions. And with that I’ll turn it over to John. John Somerhalder Thank you Steve and good afternoon. Today, we reported earnings of $1.73 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010 as compared to $1.55 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009. Each of our business units performed well to help us achieve those results and Drew will describe the business unit variances more detail in a few minutes. Our results in the first quarter put us on track to achieve our earnings target for this year in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 per share. Sequent’s results for the quarter helped put us ahead of where we expected to be at these points, at this point. Those results do however include gains on our storage and transportation hedges during the quarter in addition to good commercial activity. As is the case in all years, with price movements and changes in basis spreads, we could report further gains or losses on the hedges in subsequent quarters. As an example, if gas prices move higher from their current relatively low levels, we would recognize hedge losses as a result but would recover those losses as the gas is physically withdrawn and delivered later in 2010 and 2011. Our results also reflect contributions from our completed regulated capital projects. The Hampton Roads Crossing project in Virginia and the Magnolia pipeline project in Georgia. We place those projects in to commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our first quarter 2010 results also include the additional ownership interest we now have in the SouthStar joint venture. We have two significant milestones coming up and we’ll briefly discuss. The first is our Atlanta Gas Light rate case, which we expect to file with the Georgia Public Service Commission early next week. While we will not share the details of that case prior to when we filed, we do believe our request to be a very reasonable one. Given the significant amount of time that had had been [lapsed] and we had a rate increase in Georgia. The last base rate increase for Atlanta Gas Light was at 1993. Since that time customers have benefited significantly from the stability in our base rates and the improved reliability of our distribution system. We have established a track record of taking aggressive steps during that time to control rising utility expenses and manage our cost well. However, we continue to see annual increases in pension post- retirement and other labor cost as well as generally higher operating expenses. At the same time, we have seen a decline in our customer growth as a result for the economic pressures and the weakening housing market here in Georgia. All these factors have contributed to higher operating cost and it will be important for us to be able to recover those cost and to invest in programs to improve customer service and efficiency. We will provide more detail on the case next week after we file and we will be able to discuss it with you in more detail at our analysts meeting on May 10. The second milestone is the initial commercial operation of our Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas. We anticipate putting the first salt dome storage cavern operation during the third quarter of this year. We have reached about 85% of the first cavern and have now completed close to 60% of the pipeline construction and the compressor station work. I also want to briefly mention our AGL network sale which we announced in March. We continue to be on track to close that transaction by the end of the second quarter. We have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance to move forward and are now working through your assignments and transfers of franchise agreements and other required approvals. Again it was a very good quarter and we feel good about our progress so far this year. With that I will turn it over to Drew. Drew Evans Thanks John and good afternoon everybody. I will cover just a few of the nature segment variances and then we can go to your questions. The MD&A section of our 10-Q includes more detailed operating margin and expense variances by business unit. So I would encourage you to review those as well. Our utility operating margin was up $12 million year-over-year and that was primarily due to the revenue contributions from Hampton Roads and Magnolia which contributed $7 million of the increase. A portion of the remainder was driven by a higher usage in utilities at Florida City Gas, where weather was 90% colder than normal estimated that $3 million relative to normal temperatures for the entire division. Remember that we are largely weather agonistic in the Utility division. Slightly higher pipeline replacement revenues in Georgia also contributed to the margin increase. Some of this was offset by lower operating margin at Atlanta Gas Light Company due to a six tenths of a percent year-over-year decline in average customer count. Utility expenses were up $6 million primarily because of higher payroll and incentive expenses related to the improvement in corporate results year-over-year and to a lesser extent higher depreciation expenses. Operating margin for the retail segment also increased $12 million year-over-year. Half of this increase was driven by higher customer usage during the quarter where the weather in Georgia was 30% colder than normal and 36% colder than last year. Our delivered volume was much higher, but we are set up there to mitigate our exposure to weather and we are able to participate in some of the upside of the colder weather during the quarter. The balance of the year-over-year comparison benefited from a $6 million lower of cost to market or low comp adjustment taken during the first quarter of 2009. We recorded no similar adjustment during this year’s first quarter. SouthStar’s operating expenses were up $1 million mainly due to higher marketing costs and slightly higher bad debt expense. Operating margin for the wholesale services segment was flat year-over- year. There are several reconciling items that bear some explanation. The less significant narrowing of transportation basis spreads resulted in the $13 million decline in gains on transportation hedges during the quarter relative to the prior year. Last year we recorded $24 million and this year we only recorded $11 million. Offsetting that decline was the $6 million increase in commercial activity year-over-year as well as the $3 million increase in the gain on storage hedges as NYMEX gas prices declined throughout the first quarter of 2010. Sequent’s operating margin also benefited from a $4 million positive year-over-year variance related to a reduction in required low comp adjustments. Last year we recorded $8 million in lower of cost to market adjustments and this year we recorded just $4 million. Operating expenses for wholesale services decreased $5 million as compared to the prior year period mainly due to decreased incentive compensation and other expenses in that business unit. As Sean alluded to earlier Sequent’s reported results are subject to an amount of volatility in the coming quarters. In the second and third quarters of this year we will inject the majority of our natural gas storage inventory. This inventory will be appropriately hedged to lock in the economic margin, but should we experience increases in forward gas prices, those hedges will be marked and reflected as losses but will effectively be recovered when the locked in margins as recognized as gases deliver. That’s the rollout schedule that we talk about. If gas prices decline we will see the opposite occur only limited by low comp adjustments to the underlying inventory. Obviously we entered the year with substantially more economic value and the storage of rollout schedule than we previously have had and that economic value is embedded in our earnings guidance for this year which we are reaffirming with today’s announcement. On other matters, our interest expense for the first quarter of 2010 was $3 million higher than the same period last year. The increase is primarily the result of the additional interest expense associated with our $300 million senior notes issuance completed in August of 2009. Some simple bonding of short-term interest. The only other thing I would mention is the number 50. Our controller Brian Sea turned 50 today and chose to spend his birthday with us instead of at home and so we will thank him for that. But those are the major drivers and let’s go ahead with your questions."
27,GV_001837_2011Q1,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to First quarter 2011 AGL Resources earnings conference call. My name is Jeremy and I’ll be your coordinator for today’s call. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ms. Sarah Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah Stashak Thank you, Jeremy. Thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon to review our first quarter 2011 results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO, and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and Form 10-K filing are now available on our Web site. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Q and 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our company presentation as well as on our Web site. We’ll begin the call with some prepared remarks today before taking your questions. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you to begin. Drew Evans Thanks Sarah, and good afternoon everyone. Starting on slide three of our accompanying presentation, you can see that we reported Q1 2011 of $1.59 per diluted share, or $1.63 per share, excluding costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger we announced in December. On an adjusted basis, these results are down 6% from Q1 2010. The lower year over year earnings are largely reflective of hedge gains realized by Sequent in last year’s Q1, which had the effect of accelerating earnings into that period, and this year we did not have a similar level of accelerated gains. I’ll describe those in more detail in a moment. The decline in Q1 results, relative to the prior year, also reflects more moderate weathers compared to the prior year. The greatest impact of the moderate weather is in our retail segment, which has the most exposure to temperature fluctuation. We benefitted from strong earnings in the distribution business, which helped to offset these factors, and as a result we are on track to meet our earnings guidance range for the year of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. You can see the guidance range and our long term EPS and dividend record on slide four of the presentation. Moving on to slide five, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our stable, consistent results across the business, looking back through to 2006, and underneath that chart is a quarterly look at EBIT which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of our business, with Q1 and Q4 typically being our strongest, due to the heating season. On the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest contributor to EBIT, representing 69% of the total EBIT in Q1 2011. Retail accounted for 20%, wholesale for 10%, and energy investments for the remainder. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business, on slide six. Primarily as a result of the rate decision and new infrastructure programs at Atlanta Gas Light in Elizabethtown, EBIT was up $5 million or 4% compared to last year. You may recall that the new rates for Atlanta Gas Light were effective in Q4 2010, and we have infrastructure improvement riders in place for both Georgia and New Jersey. OpEx in the distribution segment increased 4%, and that was mainly driven by higher payroll and benefit cost, associated with hiring new customer service employees, as agreed to in the Atlanta Gas Light rate case. You can see that our customer count at the end of Q1 was up slightly from this time last year, and across all of our utilities we have focused on minimizing customer attrition over the past few years, and we believe those efforts position us well to take advantage of opportunities to grow our customer base as the economy strengthens over time. Turning to the retail segment, SouthStar, on slide seven, we recorded EBIT of $68 million for Q1 2011, down $6 million from last year. The decline was mainly the result of warmer weather and lower customer usage and to a much lesser extent, reflected changes in customer mix with more customers moving to fixed price plans. SouthStar’s market share in Georgia is 32% and our customer count for the quarter in the Georgia market was down approximately 2% relative to Q1 2010. This is generally reflective of the more aggressive competition for customers in the Georgia retail market, although if you look at it, our market share and profitability in this business over a longer time horizon, you can clearly see the underlying stability of the business. You’ll find Q1 2011 results for our wholesale services segment on slide eight. Like other natural gas wholesale marketers, Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility; our diversified approach and ability to capitalize on periods of colder weather in certain regions of the country served us well during the quarter. Commercial activity has been solid of $8 million or over 15% versus Q1 last year. We also have a stronger storage rollout scheduled at the end of the quarter, with $11 million in economic value locked in, compared to $6 million at this point last year. While Sequent’s EBIT was down $10 million year over year, the decline was due primarily to market to market hedge gains of $22 million in Q1 2010, versus just $1 million of hedge gains through Q1 2011. Hedge gains and losses are largely reflective of changes in IMAC’s natural gas prices, and the impact of these price changes on our hedge positions. Less volatility generally in this case, meant fewer changes in IMAC’s natural gas prices. You can see the wholesale operating margin component and detail on the chart at the bottom left of your page. The dark blue bar and the green bar represent transportation and storage hedge gains and losses, while the lighter blue bar represents commercial activity and the orange bar shows lower cost at market, or low com adjustments, which have been de minimus over the last several quarters. Moving to our energy investment segment, which is detailed on slide nine, you can see that Q1 2011 EBIT was $1 million, down from $3 million recorded Q1 2010. This is largely due to the sale of AGL networks in July 2010, and by way of reference, AGL networks contributed roughly $3 million of EBIT Q1 2010. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide ten. In March, we issued $500 million of three year senior notes at an interest rate of five and seven-eighths. The transaction marked the largest fund offering ever completed by AGL and carries the lowest coupon for a 30 year transaction in our history. The interest rate on these notes lowered the weighted average cost of our fixed rate debt to 5.8% from 6%, and the 30 year tenor improved the duration of our fixed rate debt maturities schedule, taking the average tenor from just over nine years to nearly 13 years. The primary intent of the senior note issue was to refinance the $300 million maturity from January 2011. We did upsize the transaction to $500 million in order to prefund $200 million, or about 20% of the Nicor acquisition financing, and thereby removing the market risk associated with the long dated portion of our financing requirements. We continue to evaluate strategies for other portions of the transaction financing. Interest expense for Q1 was up $1 million versus last year, driven primarily by higher average long term debt outstanding related to that senior note issuance. In summary, we had a solid quarter to start the year and we remain on track with our $3.10 to $3.20 EPS estimate for the full year, excluding Nicor merger related costs. We continue to look for new opportunities across each of our businesses while ensuring that our culture of rigorous expense management remains in place. Thanks for your time today, and I’ll turn the call over to John. John Somerhalder Thank you, Drew, and good afternoon. Since Drew did a thorough job in providing you with the details behind our Q1, I’ll keep it brief today and update you on a few of the major activities we’ve been focused on this year, as well as fundamentals of the natural gas markets. Turning to slide 11, I’ll start with the Nicor merger process. The most recent development, as most of you know, is that the ICC staff and several interveners filed testimony in the case late last week. The ICC staff recommended denial of the application was filed, which is not without precedent in other merger cases in Illinois. Staff set forth a number of conditions that could remedy these issues with our application, that we will be reviewing in detail. In accordance with the procedural schedule, we will file our response on or before May 26. Our focus is on ICC approval, but we already managed several important milestones in the transaction approval process. On April 18, we received early termination of the Hart-Scott- Rodino AntiTrust Improvement Act waiting period from the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission. As you know, we filed our S-4 registration statement earlier this year, and have filed amendments to the document in the past few weeks. We were notified late last week that the SEC has no further comments, and that our registration statement and joint proxy statement and prospectus have been declared effective. The special shareholders meetings in both companies to approve the merger and share issuance have been set for June 14, 2011. We remain on track to close the transaction in the second half of 2011 as planned. Our transition committee and integration teams have worked diligently over the past few months to determine how we will operate the combined company going forward, and look forward to sharing more details with you as we get closer to the transaction closing. Turning to slide 12, one of our key objectives in 2011 is working through our rate case with the Virginia State Corporation Commission. We filed a rate case in February, requesting a $25 million increase. About $15 million of that is for recovery of a significant portion of our investment in the Hampton Roads Crossing Pipeline. We previously had recorded some level of earnings on the project to AFDUC, so the impact of earnings should be negligible to slightly positive. We have not had a rate increase in Virginia since 1996. Turning briefly to the natural gas market, the fundamentals of the market have not changed materially since our last earnings call. While oil prices globally are sky-rocketing, steady and low natural gas prices are attracting renewed attention from a wide variety of customers. A shift toward increased reliance on natural gas will undoubtedly occur across many sectors of our economy over the coming years. Specifically today, natural gas prices continue to trade within a narrow range in most areas of the country. The latest storage figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that gas storage for the week ending April 22 was 11% less than the same time last year, while just slightly lower than the five year average. This relative balance shows that while we’ve added significantly more supply in to the system from shale gas producers; demand, largely as a result of the cold winter and continuing very cold spring in the Midwest to Northeast is soaking up this added supply. Price volatility has the most significant impact on our wholesale storage businesses, wholesale and our storage businesses. As Drew noted, Sequent did quite well during the quarter, finding opportunities where locational spreads widened due to the weather. That business is increasingly flexible and diverse, particularly with a focus on attracting more fee based business opportunities that are not as dependent on market volatility. This diversity allows us to produce solid results, even in this challenging environment. On the storage front, we continue to make good progress on the second cavern at Golden Triangle Storage. The leaching process is now at 50% complete, and we remain on track to have it in service by March 2012. We are continuing to evaluate possible opportunities for the more BCF of GTS cavern one capacity, that is currently not under contract. While the market for storage continues to be challenged and reservation rates are at historically low levels, I believe the overall value of natural gas storage remains high and we are firmly committed to our long term storage strategy. Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, slide 13 just serves as a reminder of our priorities for the year. We reviewed these last quarter, so I will not go into great detail, but you recall that based on what we discussed, we’re already making significant progress with the Nicor merger, the B&G rate case, our financing program, and our continuing focus on cost discipline. With our collection of distribution, retail, wholesale and storage assets, we are well positioned to take advantage of trends that are benefitting the natural gas market; abundant supply, low prices, and clean energy policies signify a long stretch of opportunities ahead. Our management team, comprised of seasoned industry veterans and innovative leaders, is constantly looking for ways to improve and grow our existing businesses at every level, and to create sustainable long term value for our shareholders. I’d like to point out that our total shareholder return year to date through April 29 is 16%, significantly outpacing the average for the broader natural gas peer group, up 10% on the average on LDC peer group of 80%. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of our company. Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
28,GV_001837_2012Q1,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Natoya and I will be your coordinator for today’s call. As a reminder this call is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session following the presentation. I would now like to turn this presentation over to Miss Sarah Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining us this afternoon to review our first quarter 2012 results. With me on call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation, and our Form 10-Q for both AGL Resources and Nicor Gas are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and in our 10-Q. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the Appendix of our presentation as well as on our website. We’ll begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks Sarah and good afternoon everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2012 GAAP earnings per share of $1.11 per diluted share for the combined enterprises, which now includes a full quarter of contribution from the legacy Nicor businesses. On an adjusted basis which excludes $6 million of after tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $1.16 which compares to $1.63 for the first quarter of 2011. The primary year-over-year driver of our first quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the first quarter of 2001 GAAP comparisons. As you update your models to include the addition of the Nicor business, you should keep in mind that historically more than 50% of the legacy AGL Resources EBIT came in the first quarter of the year. With the addition of Nicor, however, the first quarter percentage is likely to be lower as Illinois winters typically start earlier and end later resulting in 2 quarters of strong heating demand, the first and fourth quarters. Further, our Illinois fixed price retail business -- business results are not as heavily weighted toward first quarter as SouthStar’s preferred business in Georgia is. Finally, also keep in mind that cargo shipping has historically experienced its strongest results in the fourth quarter. It will take a full-year to get a better sense of actual quarterly contribution, but I did want to point out that out to you with Nicor now in the fold, our quarterly EBIT profile will be more evenly weighted than AGL’s on a stand-alone basis over the past few years. On an operating basis, the key drivers of performance during the first quarter of 2012 was historically warm weather experienced across our service territories. Had we experienced normal 10-year average weather at our distribution and retail segments, we estimate our diluted EPS would have been higher by approximately $0.11. There are also some temporal effects resulting from the warm weather that impact our business that will reverse themselves overtime, some in 2012 and some in 2013. Most of these effects can be seen in our lower of cost per market for LOCOM inventory adjustments, which are a function of declining natural gas prices during the period. The LOCOM impacts were $3 million at the Retail segment, $18 million at the Wholesale segment and $1 million at the Midstream segment. I also want to remind you that year-over-year EPS dilution on a GAAP basis is affected by the increase in our weighted average shares outstanding due to the merger. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was $117.3 million. Our interest expense was also higher, though in line with our expectations reflecting the additional debt we issued last year in connection with the merger. From an operating segment contribution standpoint, our distribution segment continues to be the largest segment contributor to EBIT, representing approximately 70% of total operating EBIT in the first quarter of 2012. With the exception of 2011 when we had a much lower than normal contribution from our Wholesale segment, this percentage of regulated utility earnings contribution is consistent with prior years and consistent with our desire to derive approximately 70% EBIT from our regulated businesses. Retail Operations accounted for 22% during the quarter, Wholesale Services 7% and Midstream Operations 1%. I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 4. EBIT was up $53 million, compared to the first quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $51 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned, the warm weather had a negative effect on Nicor Gas’ EBIT, primarily because we do not have weather normalization mechanisms in Illinois. Weather in the state was 19% warmer than normal and 26% warmer than the first quarter of 2011. We believe that normal weather would have resulted in a $13 million improvement in EBIT. You can see the month-by-month heating degree day variances for Illinois in the bottom left of the page and more detailed information for each of our service territories can be found in our 10-Q that we filed this morning. I would note that EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources utilities was up $2 million year-over-year despite the warm weather and largely due to our continued focus on effective expense management. Turning to the Retail segment on Slide 5, we recorded EBIT for the first quarter of $60 million, an $8 million decline compared to the first quarter of last year. Results were down primarily due to weather in Georgia that was 32% warmer than normal, resulting in lower customer usage. In addition, as gas prices continued their decline during the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a LOCOM adjustment that was $3 million higher than in the prior year. The addition of Nicor’s retail business reduced EBIT by $1 million during the first quarter, but we expect this loss to reverse in the summer period due to the revenue recognition accounting used for our fixed bill contracts. While operating expenses for the segment were higher reflecting the addition of Nicor’s retail businesses, operating expenses for AGL R’s legacy retail business were flat year-over-year. For the first quarter, market share in our largest market, Georgia, was 32%, which equals our market share position at the end of last year’s first quarter and our customer count declined just slightly compared with the prior year. You’ll find first quarter 2012 results for our Wholesale Services segment on Slide 6. As expected, Sequent continues to face headwinds due to challenging market fundamentals, though we are seeing some improvement versus market conditions at the end of 2011. Our EBIT contribution for the quarter was $19 million, a decline of $14 million from last year’s first quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $21 million reduction in commercial activity versus the first quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility and tight storage and transportation spreads, and John will talk about this further in his remarks. As most of you know, due to the warmer than normal weather and continued robust supply, natural gas prices continued their decline in the first quarter and hovered around the $2 mark. This price reduction resulted in a LOCOM adjustment Sequent that was $18 million higher than the last year’s first quarter. Offsetting the lower commercial activity and LOCOM adjustments were storage and transportation hedge gains that were $23 million higher than the prior year. And just to remind you, transportation and storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income. At the end of the first quarter, the value of our storage rollout schedule was $19 million, which compares favorably to a rollout schedule of $11 million at the same time last year and $3 million at the end of 2011. The seasonal storage spread has widened over the past several months and we expect to realize about half of the benefit of our rollout schedule as we progress through the year, with the remainder expected to be realized in 2013. Looking briefly at expenses for the first quarter in our wholesale business. They were down 12% compared to the prior year, even after adding Nicor’s Enerchange business. The decline is due mainly to staffing reductions, as well as lower incentive compensation accruals compared to the first quarter of 2011. Now, through to Slide 7. EBIT at our Midstream segment improved by $1 million in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2011. The improvement was due primarily to hedge gains, net of low comp adjustments at Central Valley Gas Storage for volumes of natural gas related to bringing the facility into service later this year. Briefly, the Cargo Shipping segment reported EBIT of $1 million during the first quarter of 2012. Cargo Shipping continues to face challenges due to a weak U. S. economy and little or no growth in tourism in the regions that we serve. While revenues per unit are down, TEU or 20-foot equivalent unit shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and strong management of its business. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 8. Our long-term debt was at $3.6 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and the additional Nicor debt we assume when we close the transaction. Interest expense was up $18 million for the quarter, compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the increased debt associated with the merger. As noted on the slide, we anticipate spending regulated utility capital of about $725 million in 2012, but importantly nearly half of that is being invested in programs that have minimal or no regulatory lag associated with them. We’ll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital in this manner across our utility franchises. Finally, as a reminder, we provide earnings per share guidance estimates based on normal weather among other assumptions. So the historically warm weather experienced during the first quarter of 2012, may lead the EPS results for the full year that are below our previously indicated guidance range of $2.80 to $2.95 per diluted share. Thanks for your time today. And now I’ll turn it over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thanks, Drew, and good afternoon. As Drew noted the real driver behind our first quarter performance was weather. As I mentioned at our Analyst Day in March, our Distribution, Retail and Wholesale operations can’t be affected by weather trends. And the record warmth during the first quarter certainly had an impact. On Slide 9, you can see the first quarter weather anomalies and with the exception of the Pacific Northwest, the entire country was well above the 30-year averages. In aggregate, weather was 21% warmer than normal across our jurisdictions and our Illinois service territory experienced some of the greatest anomalies. While, we have limited ability to influence the operating margin side of the equation in a single quarter, we did have the ability to control the cost side of the equation. Even though we’re still implementing some of our integration plans, we are tracking in line with our costs and synergy expectations for the year. As you know, we do have a weather normalization mechanism at Nicor Gas, which is now our largest utility. The 10-year normal for heating degree days in Illinois for the first quarter was actually 29.02 and the actual, that was for normal 10-year and the actual was 23.58. That represented a 19% departure from normal and that impacted our EBIT as Drew indicated earlier by $13 million. Retail was also impacted by the warm weather, primarily in Georgia where we generate the bulk of our earnings in that segment. Mike and his team had weather hedges in place that helped to significantly offset the weather impact. But when we are seeing temperatures over 30% warmer than normal, it is difficult to mitigate the entire impact. In 117 years of recorded history, this was the warmest weather we’ve seen across the U.S. and the sum impact to our earnings was $0.11 per share. I want to take a few minutes to talk about performance of the Wholesale segment, which has actually improved sequentially over the past several quarters. Turning to Slide 10. This chart really tells the story of why our Commercial activity has declined year-over-year. The bars show monthly transportation spreads between Henry Hub and Transco Zone 6 in New York, and between and Henry Hub and Texas Eastern’s M3 New York delivery point. Sequent has historically been active in the transportation market along the east coast, due to various asset management and supply arrangements we have in place with our utilities and with third party customers. Dramatic collapse in basis resulted in far fewer commercial opportunities for Sequent. Though we did have hedges in place during the first quarter that insulated us from the full impact of the basis decline. The warm weather and oversupply, partly from shale gas in the north-east region, were prime drivers of the year-to-year change. As we discussed in March however, we do have legacy higher cost demand charges related to transportation that will be rolling off over the next several years. So even if basis remains compressed, we should be able to improve our performance as we renegotiate certain agreements at lower rates. There are other positive signs as well. If you turn to Slide 11, you’ll see that the storage spreads have been widening over the past few months. This is due in part to the fact that the market needs an outlet for the natural gas over supply. Storage in the U.S. is now around 59% full and is running about 50% above the 5-year average. Given that we are seeing these levels at the very beginning of the injection season, even strong natural gas demand from power plants over the summer will have a hard time putting a dent in the storage overhang. Sequent has been systematically entering into new storage contracts and renewed contracts are being signed at costs that are in many cases 50% of where they were just 1 to 3 years ago. As Drew mentioned our storage roll-out schedule has significantly improved since the end of the year and we are optimistic that we will be able to lock-in additional value as we move ahead in 2012. We continue to maintain and build strong working relationships with regulatory commissions and their staff members across our service territories. These relationships, built upon consistent track records of efficient execution, have resulted in fair rate case outcomes for the company over the past several years. We are working with the Nicor team to extend these positive relationships to the Illinois Commission and we are off to a very good start including the stipulated resolution that we signed with the ICC staff earlier this year in the long-running PBR case. As a reminder, we have reached an agreement with ICC staff to credit $64 million to customers and this amount is already reflected on our balance sheet. The Illinois Attorney General and Citizens Utility Board, CUB remain parties to the case but have not signed the stipulation agreement. Hearings were held during April and the parties restated their cases. We continue to expect a ruling from the ICC on this case later this year. Turning to Slide 12, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussions and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. While we had just one quarter under our belt with the exception of weather, our businesses are performing well and are in-line with our expectations year to date. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company. Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
29,GV_001837_2013Q1,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q1 2013 AGL Resources Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Allison, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Sarah Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Allison, and thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon to review our first quarter 2013 results. Joining me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-Q are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-Q filing. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such us operating margin, EBIT and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of these measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our presentation, as well as on our website. We'll begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I'll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks, Sarah, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin today with a recap of first quarter results, and then I'll turn it over to John for some additional remarks. First, turn to Slide 3 of our presentation. You can see that we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of $1.31. This compares to $1.16 in the first quarter of 2012 when you exclude merger expenses related to the Nicor transaction. The primary year-over-year driver of $0.15 increase was more normal weather that benefited both our distribution and retail businesses. When compared to the historically warm weather experienced in 2012, our return to more normal winter temperatures resulted in a $0.13 improvement to EPS year-over-year. The benefit of slightly colder-than-normal weather was $0.03 during the quarter when compared to the 10-year average. As we mentioned on our last earnings call and at our analyst meeting, we also have introduced an EPS measure, excluding wholesale services, in an effort to reduce the impact of mark-to-market accounting on our consolidated EPS. On that basis, diluted earnings per share, excluding wholesale services, was $1.23 for the quarter, which compares to $1.06 for the first quarter of 2012. You can see here that consolidated EBIT was up 14% year-over-year, driven by a significant improvement in our distribution and retail businesses. Cargo shipping also saw an improvement year-over-year, while reported results in our wholesale and midstream segments were lower than last year. I'll speak to wholesale specifically in a moment. Our distribution retail segments contributed 94% of operating EBIT during the first quarter. Taking a closer look at each segment, a snapshot of our first quarter EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 4. EBIT was up $24 million compared to first quarter of 2012. That includes an improvement of $14 million at Nicor Gas related to weather and was slightly colder than normal versus record warmth last year. Compared to normal, which is how we set our guidance ranges, the EBIT benefit for the quarter was approximately $2 million. The remainder of the segment also performed well during the first quarter due in part to higher contributions from our ongoing regulatory infrastructure programs. Excluding pass- through expenses, operating and -- operations and maintenance expense is up $3 million or 2% year- over-year. The main reason for this increase is that, as we've discussed in prior forms, we're assuming incentive compensation returns to target levels for 2013. Without this difference, our O&M expense would have been down year-over-year, which speaks to our ongoing focus on cost control and achievement of efficiencies across our business. Our customer count remains stable and reflects a slight increase year- over-year. Turning to the retail segment on Slide 5. We recorded EBIT for the first quarter of $70 million, a $10 million increase compared to the first quarter in 2012. The increase mainly reflects weather in Georgia that was closer to normal. Year-over-year, the uplift from weather was $10 million. We also saw a contribution of roughly $1 million from our acquisition of 0.5 million warranty customers at the end of January this year. These benefits were offset somewhat by increased -- increases in transportation and gas costs and slightly lower retail price spreads. Operations and maintenance expense was down 3% year-over-year. And our market share in Georgia remained stable at 32%. And naturally, the number of warranty contracts we are serving is up substantially year-over-year due to the acquisition I just mentioned. You will find first quarter 2013 results for our wholesale services segment on Slide 6. EBIT of $15 million for the quarter is down $4 million from our recorded EBIT in the first quarter of 2012. There are a few factors affecting year-over-year results, so let me take you through them now. First, our reported commercial activity of $50 million was higher than the $24 million of reported commercial activity in the first quarter of 2012. The increase was largely driven by the withdrawal of storage inventory hedged at the end of 2012 that was included in our storage rollout schedule. In addition, we benefited from the effects of colder weather on certain of our transportation portfolio positions, particularly in the Northeastern United States. This improvement in reported commercial activity was offset by storage and transportation hedge losses recorded during the reporting period that we expect to realize in future periods. Just to remind you, we are required to mark hedges to fair value as natural gas prices change. A decline in gas prices makes hedges look more valuable and correspondingly increases reported earnings, while an increase in gas prices reduces the value of these hedges, producing an accounting loss. This time last year, we were in a declining price environment, whereas we experienced the opposite in the first quarter of 2013. As a result, we recorded hedge losses in the first quarter of 2013 of $21 million compared to hedge gains net of LOCOM of $10 million in the first quarter of last year. That's a $31 million swing period-over-period. Our storage rollout schedule is $34 million compared to $19 million at this time last year and $27 million at the end of 2012. We expect the vast majority of this rollout schedule to be realized in 2013. Again, we see good O&M expense at this point in this business segment, with costs flat year-over-year. Now let's move to Slide 7. EBIT at our midstream segment was $2 million during the first quarter of 2013, about $1 million lower than the prior year. The decline is due largely to higher depreciation, property tax and other storage-related expenses due to the additional facilities in service when compared to the first quarter of last year. As we have mentioned previously, market fundamentals remain challenging for this business segment due to low natural gas price volatility, abundant market supplies and associated low seasonal storage spreads. As a result, when contracts expire, we've either been recontracting at lower rates reflective of the current market or utilizing in-house management capabilities to optimize the assets until conditions improve to support longer-term contracts. Briefly, you can see results for the cargo shipping segment on Slide 8. We reported EBIT of $2 million during the first quarter of 2013 compared to $1 million for the same period in 2012. We continue to slowly improve market share and utilization with volume that is 10% higher year-over-year. However, the rate per twenty-foot-equivalent unit or TEU has fallen modestly due to ongoing surplus capacity, changes in cargo mix and competition in the region. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 9. Our debt-to-total capitalization improved modestly from quarter-to-quarter. Interest expense was down by $1 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2012. And as noted in our 10-Q filing, we plan to issue approximately $500 million in long-term debt in the second quarter, in part to refinance our April senior notes maturity, which we redeemed and temporarily funded out of commercial paper, as well as to term out some of our current short-term debt balances. I would say overall that we've had a very good start to the year from the standpoint of a return to more normal and even slightly favorable weather, as well as efficient control of operating and maintenance expense relative to inflationary pressures. Thanks for your time today. And now I'll turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Drew. Given the return to more normal weather following last year's record warmth, it would be easy to infer that weather is the fundamental driver of our year-over-year performance. But I think it is very important to recognize that the actions we've taken over the past 2 years related to merger efficiencies and expense control have positioned us to fully capture the margin benefit of more normal weather with essentially no additional O&M expense. Inflationary pressures alone would have added about $8 million of expense compared to the first quarter of last year. Instead, operations and maintenance expense is up just $1 million despite higher accruals for incentive compensation and addition of O&M expense associated with the warranty contracts we acquired in the first quarter of this year. This is an excellent result, and I am especially proud of our management team and employees for all of their work to achieve synergies and efficiencies across our businesses. With a solid first quarter complete, we remain on track to achieve our guidance ranges of $2.50 to $2.70 on a consolidated basis and $2.40 to $2.50 excluding wholesale services. Turning briefly to Slide 10. You will find an update on some pending regulatory and legislative items. In Illinois, we mentioned at our Analyst Day in March that legislation is pending with the Illinois house incentive related to process under which we can modify our depreciation rates at Nicor Gas outside of a general rate case. Both chambers are still in session, and we cannot predict whether the legislation will pass. However, we have a depreciation study underway, and we'll file it with the Illinois Commerce Commission later this year either under existing rules or under modified rules should the pending legislation pass. In New Jersey, we now anticipate a ruling on our updated infrastructure replacement program called AIR in the second half of this year. And as we mentioned in Georgia, we are addressing 2 items related to expanded infrastructure investment. The first is the vintage plastic replacement program that we filed in November of last year. The company was asked by the commission to make a recommendation to address the oldest vintages of plastic pipe remaining in use on our system, which is about 500 to 700 miles of pipe. We believe we can replace that pipe over the next 3 to 4 years and have provided an estimated cost of approximately $285 million to complete that work. We expect a ruling on this program in June. Second, in August, we filed an updated forecast for facilities necessary to complete our system reinforcement program under the umbrella of our STRIDE infrastructure program. Along with the new forecast, we will propose a new 3-year construction program for both our Integrated System Reinforcement Program and for the Integrated Customer Growth Program. We expect a ruling on our recommendations wfor these 2 programs by November 1. The infrastructure needs in Georgia remain at the forefront of our strategic planning. Additionally, we are pursuing opportunities to ensure that low-cost shale gas can effectively make its way into our service territory through investment in interstate pipeline projects. As you know, we have been evaluating some potential interstate pipeline investment opportunities that would provide expanded gas supply options in growing markets in Georgia and in surrounding states in the Southeast. The demand for additional pipeline capacity in the Southeast corridor has been driven primarily by recent growth in existing power generation facilities, as well as other planned expansions in the region. There are several potential opportunities and a number of different configurations for bringing additional supply into these markets. We believe that a significant capital investment in 1 or more of these projects would provide good, stable cash flows and investment returns that are generally in excess of the regulated returns in our utility business. We continue to evaluate these investment and supply opportunities, and we expect to be able to share more details with you in the coming months. Before we take questions, I'll add a little color to Drew's comments related to our wholesale services business. As he said, while we did see a year-over-year improvement in reported commercial activity during the first quarter, as we progress through the year, we expect to experience challenges capturing additional value on our storage portfolio since spreads have continued to tighten and compress. Current summer to winter price spreads are approximately $0.30 compared to more than $1 at the same time last year. Further, and similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2012, the first quarter was impacted by forward price volatility experienced at natural gas delivery points throughout the Northeast corridor, as you can see on Slide 11, this volatility related to natural gas supply constraints in the region and it impacted our forward Northeast transportation positions and caused $4 million in mark-to-market accounting hedge losses. However, these same conditions are economically beneficial to our unhedged transportation positions in the Northeast, which have gained in value in the same time period. On Slide 12, we're reiterating our 2013 priorities, and we are making meaningful progress on each of those. Again, excellent quarter on the whole, and we have started 2013 on solid footing. We thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources. We look forward to seeing many of you at the AGA Financial Forum next week. Operator, at this time, I'll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
30,GV_001837_2008Q2,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2008 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Erica, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Steve Cave, Managing Director of Investor Relations. You may proceed, sir. Steve Cave Okay. Thank you, Erica, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our second quarter 2008 earnings results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We have several other members of our management team here with us to address any questions that you may have following the prepared remarks. We issued our earnings release and filed our Form 10-Q this morning. If you don't have a copy of those already, you can find copies of those documents on our website. We also have a slide presentation that provides a summary of some of the key highlights for the quarter on the website as well. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material difference are included in our press release and 10-Q and more fully described in our most recent 10-K filings. We also use some non-GAAP measures such as EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes, and operating margin in describing our business and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release, our SEC filings as well as on our website. One thing you should also note is in our earnings release this quarter, we have provided consolidated earnings results excluding the impacts of hedge gains and losses and inventory valuation adjustments in our wholesale services segment. Obviously, those are also non-GAAP measures. We believe they'll provide more transparency around our business and enable better comparisons between reporting periods, particularly since hedge gains and losses and inventory valuation adjustments in a given period typically are driven by changes in gas prices and transportation basis spreads, and not really reflective of the economic value of the underlying transactions. We have also included in our earnings release and presentations a reconciliation of those results to GAAP financials as well. We will begin today's call with some prepared remarks and then we will open the lines to take your questions. And with that, I'll turn it over to John. John W. Somerhalder II Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported a net loss of $0.15 per diluted share compared to earnings of $0.40 per share during the second quarter last year. Consistent with our earlier release, these results include a loss of $0.45 per diluted share for the wholesale services segment associated with the storage and transportation metrics. We saw a significant increase in forward NYMEX natural gas prices during the quarter and a widening of the transportation basis spreads. And as a result, we recorded hedge losses of $55 million during the quarter in that segment. We will walk you through the quarter and year-to-date comparisons in a minute, but as Steve pointed out, we have provided in our earnings release EPS excluding these hedge gains and losses and lower cost of market inventory adjustments in wholesale services in order to provide a more transparent... in order to provide more transparency into the economics of the transactions at wholesale services and help you better understand our quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year accounting results. We've listened to your feedback from many of you on this one and agree this presentation provides a better view of the underlying economic performance of our business. And in future quarters, we'll provide this information to you as a supplement to our reported GAAP financials. On an adjusted basis, our earnings for the second quarter of 2008 were $0.30 per diluted share, up from $0.27 per diluted share for the second quarter last year. On the same basis, our earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2008, were $1.59 per diluted share compared to a $1.62 per diluted share for the same period last year. Based on the year-to-date results and our expectations for the third and fourth quarter, today we reaffirm our earnings guidance in the range of $2.75 to $2.85 per share for fiscal year 2008. Before I turn it over to Drew to go over the financial results in more detail, I would like to spend a few minutes updating you on the progress on several of our key initiatives. With respect to the Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas, construction on that project is well under way and we expect to have the brine disposal well drilled for the first half during the third quarter, which will enable us to begin constructing the leech plant and drilling the first cavern. As with most of the other players in the storage development business, we continue to see escalating commodity prices that impact the overall cost of our project. Given the increases in labor and materials and commodity prices, particularly the cost of steel and higher costs for pad gas, at this point we estimate that the total cost of the project will be approximately 10% to 20% higher than our previous estimate of $265 million. We did point out in our 10-Q however that these costs could fluctuate up or down depending on whether we see the cost of these items decline, moderate or continue to rapidly increase over time. And just as an example, the cost estimate at the end of third quarter was pretty much at the middle to a little bit at the higher end of that range, but with the recent run off in gas prices and how that impacts pad gas cost, we're now moving lower in the range. We also continue to make very good progress on our Hampton Roads Crossing project in Virginia, which will connect northern and southern portions of the Virginia natural gas system and provide better system reliability and supply diversity. As a result, that project remains on track to be completed and put into service in the fourth quarter of 2009. The escalation of commodity prices that I discussed earlier has also had some impact on the overall cost of the Hampton Roads Project but we have been able to mitigate these increases on some of the major items. As an example, we purchased the pipe for this project prior to the recent unprecedented run up in steel and pipe prices that we all saw in the industry. With respect to the Magnolia Project, which will help us to move natural gas from the Elba Island LNG facility into the Atlanta market, about two weeks ago, FERC approved the joint application that we filed with Southern Natural Gas to move forward with this project. Initially in its approval, FERC issued a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, approved the sale of facilities to Magnolia and authorized SNG to lease facilities from Magnolia. We are in the process now of finalizing an agreement with Southern Natural Gas that will allow us to move forward under this FERC order and expect to hold [ph] the compression for this project as early as tomorrow. As you can see, we had made and continue to make significant progress on these three important growth projects. Just a couple of other observations related to what we're seeing in our utilities related to customer growth and our expectations around possible increases and bad debt expense and conservation heading into the winter heating season. As you can see in our disclosures, we continue to see challenging economic conditions in the areas our utility serve and the continued slump in the housing market certainly has resulted in customer growth overall that is lower than we had previously targeted. On a consolidated basis, our utility growth was 0.1% during the second quarter of 2008 relative to the prior-year quarter. For the first six months of the year, it was 0.3% relative to the same period last year. We continue to focus on targeting marketing programs to reduce attrition levels, but we expect to see these lower customer growth patterns continue into 2009 absent some earlier correction in the housing market in the regions we serve. We've seen some positive signs in certain sectors though. For example, we're seeing some natural gas conversions by commercial customer as they switch from other higher priced fields. We also are aware that while prices have moderated somewhat recently in the recent weeks, the high- priced environment for natural gas this summer has created some concerns for many utilities about higher bad debt and conservation levels during this winter season... heating season. While we have seen slightly higher bad debt during the second quarter as a result of higher natural gas prices, the levels we've seen have not caused any unusual concerns for us at this point. We will continue to monitor bad debt conservation trends and we'll keep you informed over the next few quarters. Also, I think it's important to point out that we have regulatory mechanisms in place to help mitigate a large portion of our risk in these areas. As an example, our largest utility, Atlanta Gas Light which represents about 65% of our total customer base is not volumetrically sensitive because of straight fixed variable rate design. And SouthStar's exposure is mitigated to a high degree because of the credit quality of its customer base. Additionally, we continue to be proactive in using the tools that are available to us such as shut-off for non-pay and are aggressively managing bad debt at our other utilities. Most importantly in this environment, we continue to maintain our rigorous focus on cost control to help ensure stable operating results for the year. With that, I will turn it over for Drew for a financial discussion. Andrew W. Evans Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Clearly the main driver you should focus your attention on for the quarter is the accounting impact of Sequent's business. I'm going to walk you through the details of that first before we turn over to the other operating segments. The wholesale services segment had an EBIT loss, that's earnings before interest and tax loss, for the second quarter of $65 million compared with the positive EBIT of 6 million for the same quarter last year, so a $71 million swing primarily driven by the impact of hedge gains and losses. I think the best way to walk through is to direct your attention to the reconciliation schedule that we have on page 27 in the 10-Q. First line you see is what we call commercial activity which is generally the way you can engage economic value created and recognized during a particular reporting period. You can see in the table that commercial activity in the second quarter of 2008 was up $3 million relative to the prior-year quarter. The next three items in the table are the ones that are highly sensitive to changes in NYMEX forward prices for natural gas and changes in transportation basis spreads and these are the items we exclude, when John discussed EPS results earlier. The first of those items in the gain or losses on... is the gain or losses on storage hedges. You can see that rising NYMEX prices during the second quarter of 2008 resulted in $48 million of losses on the instruments we used to hedge our inventory and storage. In contrast, last year during the second quarter, prices declined during the quarter which resulted in a $16 million gain on those hedges. So that accounts for a $64 million difference year-over-year. Looking at the second item, which is gains or losses on transportation hedges, the winding of transportation basis spreads during this year's second quarter resulted in Sequent recording of $7 million loss on its transportation hedges whereas last year we saw an narrowing of these spreads that resulted in the $3 million gain to a $10 million swing year-over-year. The $74 million reduction in quarter-over- quarter earnings from gains and losses associated with storage and transportation hedge positions was partially offset by a $3 million lower cost of -market inventory adjustment we were required to record during the second quarter of last year because of lower natural gas prices. A similar adjustment was not required to be recorded during the current year second quarter. That is a lot of reconciliation for the operating margin line but hopefully the breakdown of the components we've provided in our disclosures will give you a better sense of all the moving parts. And our EPS results excluding the hedge gains and losses and LOCOM adjustments provide you with a better transparency around our results after adjusting for these accounting impacts which again did not affect underlying economic margins. The wholesale services segment operating expense for the quarter were $12 million, up $3 million over the same quarter last year reflecting higher payroll and other operating costs associated with the continued growth and expansion of the business. We've seen stronger commercial activity for Sequent... for the year Sequent as compared to last year with year-over-year increases of about $8 million. The inventory roll out schedule on page 23 of the 10-Q gives you a good view of the expected timing for realization of future economic value in the Sequent portfolio that has not yet been realized in reported results. You can see that as of June 30, we expected $55 million in value to be realized in the third and fourth quarters of this year with about $16 million to be realized in the first quarter of 2009. However, just over the past few weeks, we've seen a pretty dramatic decrease in natural gas prices, and if that pattern continues through the third quarter, you could expect to see an acceleration to some degree of those 2009 earnings into 2008. The magnitude of that acceleration is very difficult to quantify until we know where prices will settle during the quarter, but it is something we wanted to call your attention to, given the current pricing environment. Turning to distribution operations, that segment's EBIT for the second quarter of 2008 was $57 million. That is a $7 million decrease from the prior-year period. Operating margins, just to break that down for you, operating margins decreased by $3 million. The reconciling items included an adjustment related to revision of estimates of unbilled gas volumes at Elizabethtown Gas, which was $3 million. A $2 million decrease in the Atlanta Gas Light relates to the lower customer growth and lower gas storage carrying costs offset by a $2 million of additional pipeline replacement revenues for Atlanta Gas Light. Operating expenses were up $3 million reflecting higher bad debt expenses primarily related to higher natural gas prices as well as slightly higher depreciation expense related to asset replacement service. Our retail energy operating segment SouthStar contributed EBIT for the quarter of $5 million equal to last year's contribution. Operating margin in that segment decreased by $2 million compared to the prior- year quarter mainly due to warmer weather during the period. Operating expenses though were down $1 million primarily due to lower payroll and another operating costs offset by slightly higher bad debt expense largely due to higher natural gas prices. Turning to energy investments, EBIT for the second quarter of 2008 was $10 million. That's an $8 million increase over last year's second quarter. Operating margin increased by $9 million driven mainly by higher operating margins at AGL Networks due to a network expansion project in the Phoenix market. We also had slightly higher margins from [inaudible] storage services at Jefferson Island and operating expenses were up $2 million mainly due to the Phoenix network expansion by AGL Networks and slightly higher cost at our Jefferson Island facility. So just to summarize, we are about $0.03 ahead of the quarter a year ago and about $0.03 behind on a year to date basis. That covers the highlights of the operating segments. And with that, we can take your questions. Question and Answer"
31,GV_001837_2009Q2,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the AGL Resources second quarter 2009 earning conference call. My name is Brandi and I will be your operator for today. At this time all attendees are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a Q&A session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) I would turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Steven Cave. Please proceed sir. Steven Cave All right, thank you, Brandi, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review second quarter 2009 results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO, Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We have several other members of our management team here with us today to answer questions following the prepared remarks. As you know, we issued our earnings release and filed our Form 10-Q this morning, before the market opened. If you don't have copies of those documents, you can get them those on our website. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and in our 10-Q and are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filing. We also used some non-GAAP measures in describing our business and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financial measures is available in the earnings release and SEC filings, as well as on our Web site. So we will begin today's call with some prepared remarks, and then we will open the line to take your questions. And with that I'll turn it over to John. John Somerhalder Thanks Steve and good morning. Today we reported second quarter earnings of $0.26 per diluted share, compared with a $0.15 per share loss during the second quarter last year. On a year-to-date basis we have earned a $1.81 per diluted share compared to a $1.01 per diluted share for the same period of 2008. Drew will cover the financial drivers in more detail, but first I want to update you on a number of recent events. This morning we issued a joint announcement with Piedmont Natural Gas, that we have reached an agreement that resolves an issue related to our buyout option on the SouthStar partnership. Under the terms of that agreement, we will purchase half of Piedmont's ownership share of the business for $57.5 million. As a result, once over, we will own 85% of the joint venture and will receive 85% of the annual earnings, while Piedmont will own 15% of the joint venture. The effective date of the agreement is January 1, 2010. Both companies have received approval of this transaction from our respective Boards of Directors. And we will now need to get final approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission. We have a longstanding partnership and relationship with Piedmont and they have been very good partners and we look forward to continuing that partnership. This transaction puts more certainty around the partnership structure. Importantly, it will provide immediate value to our shareholders and is a solution that works very well for both companies. The agreement will also result in the dismissal of the outstanding lawsuit that Piedmont filed in the Delaware courts earlier this year. Now turning to our regulatory strategy; as you know, we filed a request with the Georgia PSC in June for approval of a program that will significantly enhance our pipeline infrastructure, particularly in the outlying areas of Metro Atlanta. That program, which we call STRIDE or Strategic Infrastructure Development Enhancement would be a ten-year program and the request we have filed with the Commission is for the initial three-year period and for approximately $176 million in capital expenditures. Our proposed recovery mechanism for the STRIDE program is essentially the same as our pipeline replacement program, which uses a monthly rider on customer bills to recover costs rather than these costs being embedded in our base rates. The PSC issued a procedural schedule in July and we expect a decision on the program in early October. That leads me to the Georgia rate case and our recently announced decision to delay filing that case until early next year. As you know we have planned to file the case in November, as required under the rate case order issued by the PSC in 2005. We will now focus first on working with the Commission evaluate and implement the STRIDE program and then we plan to file our Georgia rate case in the second quarter of 2010. We have made and continue to make prudent investment in our Georgia business and fully intend to seek recovery of those investments. We remain cognizant of the impact of base rate increases on our customers particularly during challenging economic times. The good news is that the impact of lower natural gas prices should more that offset potential base rate increases. Now turning to our major capital projects; we continue to make very good progress on both our regulated and our unregulated pipeline and storage projects. Both Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia, and Magnolia project here in Georgia are on schedule to be completed and in service by the end of this year. The Golden Triangular Storage project in Texas remains on schedule for the first cavern to be placed into initial commercial operation in service in the third or potentially fourth quarter of 2010. With that I will turn it to Drew for the financial discussions. Andrew Evans Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I will cover a few of the major earnings progress for the quarter in the year and then we can go to your questions. We have had good improvement in distribution operations for the quarter and year-to-date relative to last year, with a $6 million and $13 million EBIT increase for those periods respectively. The improvement was largely a function of higher margins at Atlanta Gas Light, from carrying charges we receive for storing natural gas on behalf of marketers and Georgia, and higher revenues resulting from more investment in pipeline replacement and improvement. Operating expenses are running slightly higher than last year mainly because of higher depreciation, pension and environmental liability expenses, and slightly higher bad debt expense. In this area we are seeing about a $1.5 million increase relative to an expectation of about $15 million full year, so important for capital to be material for the total. Overall the earnings improvements in the distribution business is a good result, given the fact that we remain challenged from a customer growth perspective. I pointed this out in our last earnings call but should probably reiterate the point that we have variable sensitivity to downturn in the industrial sector, as only about 5% of our total utility margin is generated from industrial customers across our six utilities. I know this is trend that is impacting some other companies in our space and I wanted to make sure you understand how limited our exposure is in this area. Just to put it in perspective our top 20 utility customers represents less than 2% of our total utility receivables exposure. In the retail segment, second quarter typically is not a big driver for us. SouthStar's results were fairly flat year-over-year and on a year-to-date basis are equal to last year. We had higher margins from the management of transportation storage assets during the quarter, but those gains were offset by lower customer count and higher numbers of customers moving to low margin fixed price contracts. Those same trends largely drove the year-to-date results as well in addition to the impact of $6 million lower cost to market inventory adjustment in the first quarter of this year, as a result of declining natural gas prices. If you recall, we did not record a similar adjustment in the retail segment in the first half of 2008. The wholesale segment is clearly the largest year-over-year driver Sequent had an EBIT loss of $11 million for the second quarter, compared to a loss of $65 million during last year's second quarter. The significant difference there is that we had $55 million in hedge losses that we recorded in last year's second quarter as a result of increases in natural gas prices and the widening of transportation basis spreads. This year, we saw declining gas prices and narrowing transportation spreads, which resulted in $13 million worth of hedge gains. We also saw lower commercial activity during the quarter relative to the prior year period as a result of lower market volatility. However, during the quarter, we were able to build up storage inventory and create economic value that will be recognized later in the year and early next year. You can now see our inventory rollup schedule in the queue, which describes about $14 million of value not yet recognized in this year and some into 2010. Year-to-date Sequent EBIT of $27 million compares with the loss $64 million for the same period in 2008 and again the differential reflects changes in natural gas prices transportation basis spreads and the relative hedge movements that I just described. Its important to know that the hedge loses we recorded in Sequent in the second quarter last year, were substantially recovered in last year's third quarter as we saw a significant decline in NYMEX prices. So if you model out the rest of the year, you should keep this issue in mind as it will impact the comparability of quarterly results year-over-year. We reported $0.85 of earnings in the third quarter of 2008 on normal its much closer to the mid to high teens that assumes static price to variability, its still reasonable to expect in 2009. In the Energy Investments segment, keep in mind that last year in the second quarter we had $7 million in operating revenues associated with AGL networks Phoenix expansion, a sale that's largely a one-time gain and we do not have at this year. So that is why you see relatively large variance quarter-over-quarter. Just one other item to note and that's liquidity; we have benefited significantly from this year from lower natural gas prices and their impact on working capital requirements. You may recall last year that we built nearly $1 billion worth of inventory at its peak when natural gas prices were in the $10 to $12 range. This year we have seen a significant improvement in working capital as a result of lower gas prices that are in the $3 to $4 range and taken the opportunity to built significantly more inventory at this point in the summer than last year. We're about 90% full relative to a 75% build at this time last year. These percentages are estimates of our total but are representative of our [fill]. Our short-term debt is down nearly 20% relative to the last year and we continue to have good access to the commercial paper markets. We have also no outstanding borrowings under out $1 billion credit facility, and the supplemental $140 million facility. One thing I would like to note is that the $140 million facility expires in September of this year and we don’t anticipate needing to renew that facility. Those were the major drivers and for the quarter and for the year. So, with that we will move on to your questions."
32,GV_001837_2010Q2,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter 2010 AGL Resources Earnings conference call. At this time all participant are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question- and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today Mr. Steve Cave, Vice President of Finance. You may proceed. Steve Cave Okay thank you Francis and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our second quarter and year-to-date earnings results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President, and CEO and Drew Evans, Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release and Form 10-Q filing are both available on our website, if you do not have copies already. And let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those statements. The factors that could cause such material difference are included in our earnings release and our Form 10-Q and are further detailed in the latest Form 10-K filings. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin and EBIT and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in our earnings release. We will begin with some prepared remarks today before taking your questions and with that let me turn it over to John. John Somerhalder Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. Today we reported second quarter earnings of $0.17 per diluted shares. These results are down $0.09 from the results for the second quarter of last year. There are a couple of significant drivers or our quarterly results. First and most significantly just as in prior years we can have hedged gains and losses on our storage and transportation hedges at our wholesale services business. With an offset in gain or loss occurring in future periods as the economics are fully realized on the hedge storage or transportation positions. During the quarter we had hedged losses primarily from our transportation hedges and to a lesser extent our storage hedges. That value will be recognized in future periods as the positions go to physical delivery or otherwise settled. Last year we had the opposite effect, which is that we had hedged gains on both storage and transportation hedge positions during the quarter. The second driver is related to the impact of weather on our retail business SouthStar. We are off to a good start with SouthStar year-to-date as the weather in the first quarter was 30% colder than normal in Georgia. In the second quarter however weather was 50% warmer than normal and was particularly warm in April resulting in SouthStar’s lower results for the quarter. We also completed the sale of our AGL Networks business on July 1. The results for the quarter include $0.02 per share related primarily to the sales cost on that transaction which was consistent with our expectations. Importantly through the first six months of the year our earnings results of $1.90 per diluted shares are up $0.09 compared to prior year year-to-date results. As a result we continue to be on track to meet our 2010 earnings guidance range of $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted shares. We have had strong performance from each of our business units to help us achieve these results and Drew will describe each of the business unit variances in more details in a few minutes. Before we do that I would like to briefly describe a couple of the major operational and regulatory issues we will focus our attention on in the second half of the year. As you know we filed the Atlanta Gas Light rate case in early May requesting a total of $54 million to recover prudently incurred investments we had made in the business and increases in estimated operated expenses. The requested increase would raise the typical customer’s annual gas bill by approximately 3%. The Atlanta Gas Light has not been authorized to increase its base rates for customers since 1993. The outcome of our last rate proceeding required the company to file this rate case now and we believe it is important that we be allowed to recover the prudent cost of operating our business and improving our customer service platform. We believe that our request is a very reasonably one given the significant amount of time that has elapsed since our last rate increase in Georgia and the stability in base rate customers have seen over that time period. The hearings in the case will begin in late August and we anticipate a decision by the Georgia Public Service Commission in early November. Both Hank Linginfelter and Bryan Batson are here and can answer any specific questions you have about the rate case. Turning to our unregulated operations, we have made very good progress on a couple of projects in our pivotal business. We continue to make excellent progress on building our Golden Triangle storage facility in Texas and are planning to begin initial commercial operation for the facility in September. We have leased the cavern and are now nearing completion of the nine mile pipeline header system and finalizing work on the compressor station. We planned to begin injecting gas into the system in mid to late August in preparation for commercial service. We also have begun the leasing process on the second cavern which is now about 10% complete and remains on schedule for an end service date in early to mid-2012. As we have discussed before we currently have one-third of the first contract cavern contracted and we plan to begin services on that contract when we begin commercial operations and we will make a decision on contracting the remaining capacity as we get closer to full commercial operations. We also made progress on moving forward with the expansion of our Jefferson Island salt-dome storage facility in Louisiana. At the end of June we filed the required permit applications with the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources. We expect the permitting process to take somewhere in the range of six to nine months. We are continuing to define the engineering project scope of the expansion in order to determine the revised projects schedule and cost estimate. And we will be able to provide you with more detail around that as we get closer to the beginning of construction. We feel very good about the progress on each of these major initiatives and about the progress we have made year-to-date in achieving our earnings targets for the year. I will now turn it over to Drew for the financial discussion. Drew Evans Thanks John and good morning everybody. I will cover a few of the major segment variances and then we can go to your questions. Focus here on the year-to-date variances compared to the prior period not so much on the quarter although Sequent results probably fare a little more explanation around results for the quarter as well as for the year. The 10-Q that we filed this morning provides most of the operating margin and expense reconciliations you need for the quarter by reporting segment. Our distribution business has performed very well year-to- date. EBIT for that business is up $12 million compared to the first six months of last year. The increase is principally due to the addition of earnings for pipeline projects we couldn’t service last year. That’s the Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia and Magnolia project in Georgia. We also benefited from significantly colder than normal weather in the first quarter of this year particularly in Florida and from new rates at Elizabethtown Gas following the rate case settlement in December of last year. Utility expenses were up $6 million primarily because of higher payroll and incentive expenses related to improved corporate results year-over-year and to a lesser extent higher depreciation expense. Turning to the retail marketing segment EBIT is up $7 million compared to the prior year. The increase  is largely a function of higher average customer usage particularly during the first quarter when weather in Georgia was 30% colder than normal. We also saw increased margins in the Ohio and Florida markets offset somewhat by a decline in the average number of customers and a change in the retail pricing plan mix in the Georgia market. The year-over-year comparison also benefits from a $6 million lower cost to market adjustment (inaudible) taken during the first quarter of 2009. We reported no similar adjustments in either of this year’s quarters. And SouthStar’s operating expenses were flat relative to the prior year. John described it earlier but as we normally see with Sequent quarterly reporting results can be more volatile for this business and for other business segments, particularly in the second and third quarters. This is because we are building inventory and locking in profits of physical delivery, changes in market prices for natural gas will cause us to support either gains or losses on these hedges despite the fact that there is no change in the underlying economics of the transaction. Commercial activity at Sequent improved $10 million quarter over quarter but price movements this year produced hedge losses of $8 million versus hedge gains last year of $13 million. The heads movements this year which are primarily associated with our transportation capacity positions will unwind in future periods as these positions are sold or in the case of storage hedges when the GAAP inventories are withdrawn and sold later this year and early next. On a year-over-year basis commercial activity is up $21 million while changes in hedge values increased the year-over-year variance by $33 million. Our storage roll out schedule which is included in our Form 10-Q reflects $25 million of value to be realized in future periods. We also recorded $8 million of LOCOM adjustments in 2009 for the first six months and have reported $4 million of similar adjustments during the first six months of 2010. Operating expenses were down $7 million year-over-year at Sequent largely a function of lower incentive compensation expense. Turning to energy, the energy investment segment, the variance explanation will be procurement for a while due to the sale of AGL Networks or dark fiber telecommunications business. As John mentioned we have now closed the sale of that business. As you know we have operated that business for about 10 years and while it was profitable it did not fit into our core strategy and so we capitalized on an opportunity to sell it to a company that is primarily focused in the telecommunications business and is better able to make more significant capital investments towards growing the business in the future. As we have stated before, our earnings guidance for the year does take into account the effect of the AGL network sale including the absence of income from that business in the second half of the year. Interest expense for the first six months of 2010 is up $5 million over the same period of 2009 and that principally reflects the additional interest expense associated with our $300 million issuance of senior notes in August of last year. Those were the major drivers. Let’s go to your questions now."
33,GV_001837_2011Q2,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Second Quarter 2011 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alicia and I'll be your coordinator for today’s call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. (Operator instructions). We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session following the presentation. I’d now like to turn the presentation over to Ms. Sarah Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah Stashak Thank you, Alicia. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning to review our second quarter 2011 results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and Form 10-Q filing are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Q and 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our accompanying presentation as well as on our website. We'll begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I'll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew Evans Thanks, Sarah, and good morning everybody. Starting on Slide 3 of our accompanying presentation, you can see that we reported second quarter 2011 earnings of $0.23 per diluted share or $0.33 per share excluding the costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger we announced last December. The improvement in year-over-year earnings is largely reflective of strong performance in our utility business through a combination of reasonable rate case outcomes and infrastructure investment we have made to maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our system. For the first six months of the year, we reported diluted GAAP EPS of $1.82 or $1.96 excluding Nicor related expenses, $0.06 higher than the first six months of 2010. We remain on track to meet our earnings guidance range for the year of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. You can see the guidance range on our long-term EPS and dividend track record on Slide 4 of the presentation. Moving on to Slide 5, you'll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our stable and consistent results across the business, looking back to 2006 and underneath that chart is a quarterly look at EBIT which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of our business. You'll note that second quarter is not typically a strong earnings quarter for us due to lower heating and cooling demand. On the right, note that our Distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT, representing approximately 69% of total EBIT in the first half of 2011. Retail accounted for 22%, wholesale for 9% and energy investments for the remainder I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our Distribution business on Slide 6. Primarily as a result of the rate decisions and infrastructure programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown, EBIT was up $7 million or 10% compared to last year, mainly due to a $10 million improvement in operating margin. You may recall that the new rates for Atlanta Gas Light were effective in the fourth quarter of 2010 and we have infrastructure improvement riders in place in both Georgia and New Jersey. Operating expenses in the distribution segment increased just 2% and that was mainly driven by higher payroll and benefit costs associated with hiring new customer service employees, consistent with our commitment we made during the Atlanta Gas Light rate case. You can see that our average customer count for the second quarter was down just slightly from this time last year, but remains stable. Year-to-date our Distribution business reported EBIT of $217 million, up 6% versus last year. The same major drivers we saw in the quarter also are the factors driving the good performance for the first half of the year and these results put our utility business on track to have a strong year in 2011. At Virginia Natural Gas we’re in the middle of a rate case, which we expect to be decided sometime during the first half of next year. Consistent with regulation in Virginia, we will put rates into effect on October 1st, subject to refund. The monthly rate increase will average approximately $6 per customer over the course of the year. This is the first rate increase for Virginia Natural Gas customers in 15 years as base rates have not changed there since 1996. Turning to the retail segment, SouthStar on Slide 7, we recorded EBIT of $1 million for the second quarter of 2011, equal to our results for last year’s second quarter. Due to positive weather variance quarter-over- quarter, we experienced increased margin, but that was offset by the continued competitive environments in Georgia including customer migration toward lower margin plans. SouthStar’s market share in Georgia is 32%, relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, EBIT at SouthStar is down 8% compared to 2010, due mainly to warmer weather in the first quarter of 2011 versus 2010 and the migration of customers to lower margin pricing plans. You will find second quarter 2011 results for our Wholesale Services segment on Slide 8. Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price differentials for storage and transportation, but our diversified approach continued to service well through the first half of the year. We saw modest improvement in commercial activity during the second quarter relative to the prior year period, but the main driver for Sequent’s year-over-year improvement was the fact that we had $8 million in hedge gains during this year’s second quarter associated with hedges on our storage and transportation positions. Conversely, last year in the second quarter, we had $8 million of hedge losses, so the $16 million delta was the largest change in Sequent’s second quarter earnings year-over-year. Year-to-date, our wholesale services segment contributed EBIT of $28 million, a $5 million increase over the first half of 2010. Operating margin was higher by $8 million, largely driven by $17 million of higher commercial activity offset by lower hedge gains. Looking at our current storage rollout schedule at the end of the second quarter, Sequent had $11 million of economic value, which is $14 million below last year at this same time. This reflects the lower volatility and reduced spreads we continue to see in the market, factors that we anticipate will continue to challenge Sequent’s business through the remainder of the year. However, we expect to partially mitigate these impacts by continuing to grow our asset portfolio, build our fee-based services and maintain our focus on expense control as we support growth in these areas. The lower roll-out schedule also reflects in part the acceleration of value during the first half of this year that would otherwise have been realized later in the year. Finally, as you think about third quarter results for the wholesale segment, just a reminder that Sequent recorded $30 million in combined transportation and storage hedge gains in the third quarter of 2010. We would not expect to repeat this under normal market conditions. On Slide 9, you can see that our energy nvestment segment had a slight improvement during the quarter as compared to last year. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. Also, for comparative purposes just keep in mind that we sold our telecommunications business, AGL Networks in July of last year. In the storage business during the quarter we added new contracts at both Golden Triangle Storage and Jefferson Island Storage & Hub. One of the contracts that GTS signed during the quarter was with Sequent and John will review the rationale behind the transaction with you. You can see here that our blended rate for our 6 Bcf at GTS Cavern 1 is $0.14 and at Jefferson Island it is $0.19. These rates are inclusive of contracts that Sequent has signed with the facility. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. The main thing that I would point out here is that we have made substantial progress toward financing the cash consideration of the Nicor transaction. As we noted in our 10-Q, we are finalizing documentation with various institutional investors for $275 million in funding through the private placement market in five and seven-year tranches, which we expected to take care of the short-duration portion of the curve for our financing activity related to the Nicor merger. Including the $200 million pre-funding we did early in this year as part of the March senior note series issuance, we have arranged approximately 50% of the expected cash financing necessary for closing. The private placement is a delayed draw and we will not incur interest expense until we move closer to the close of the transaction. Interest expense was up $6 million for the second quarter and $7 million for the first half of the year versus last year, driven primarily by higher average long-term debt outstanding related to that senior note issuance we issued in March of this year, which is inclusive of the portion to pre-fund the Nicor transaction. In summary, we had another good performance during the second, we had another much stronger performance during the second quarter and we remain on track with our 3.10 to 3.20 EPS estimate for the full year, excluding Nicor-related merger costs. We continue to look for new opportunities across each of our businesses, while ensuring that our culture of rigorous expense management remains in place. Thanks for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to John. John Somerhalder Thank you, Drew and good morning. Now that we have been through the financial details for the second quarter, let me update you on a few of our other major initiatives, including the Nicor merger approval process which is outlined on Slide 11. With the exception of the Illinois Commerce Commission, we secured all major approvals that we will need to close the Nicor transaction, including shareholder approvals which we received in June. We continued to make progress towards ICC approval. After several rounds of filed testimony, we participated in evidentiary hearings in Illinois two weeks ago. Our witnesses presented a strong case for merger approval, and we have considerably narrowed the list of issues we need to resolve with the ICC staff. We continue to work for resolution of those issues. We remain on track for closing the transaction by year end and our integration planning efforts are focused on ensuring we are operationally ready in the event that we are granted expedited approval. As a reminder, we have asked for expedited approval by October 1, but the current Illinois procedural schedule runs through December 16th. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved recommendations from Nicor for four new appointees to the AGL Resources' Board of Directors. The nominees are Norman Bobins, Brenda Gaines, Armando Olivera and John Rau and they will join the 12 existing AGL Resources' Board members. Norman, Brenda, Armando and John bring a wealth of experience and diverse backgrounds and we look forward to welcoming them officially when the merger closes. Turning to Slide 12, you can see our 2011 priorities that we laid out at the beginning of the year. As Drew mentioned, overall we remain on target to meet our guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share. The distribution business performed quite well during the first half relative to expectations and we anticipate that this trend will continue through the remainder of the year. Our utilities experienced very little impact from low volatility as they are largely insulated from price fluctuations through riders and weather normalization programs. The businesses that are impacted more substantially by tight spreads and low volatility are our non-utility businesses. While abundant supply has positive long-term implications for our industry and business, abundant storage combined with historically low spreads creates a challenging environment in the short- term. At SouthStar, our results year-to-date have fallen slightly below our expectations. We’ve done well (inaudible) a stable customer base and our Georgia market share has been trending mostly upward this year, but we are seeing a continuation of the trend of customers migrating towards lower margin plans. Further impacting that business has been average warmer temperatures and lower volatility. Sequent has produced strong results today despite a tough environment for wholesale and asset optimization businesses. However, our storage rollout position for the remainder of the year is now lower than it was at this time last year. The positive of this result is that we had strong commercial activity during the first half of the year and affectively monetized many of our positions. The downside is that it also means we have a somewhat weaker position for the remainder of the year assuming low volatility persists. We’ve been diversifying Sequent’s business by focusing on fee-based services, power generation supply and producer services among other initiatives, which should help us mitigate the impacts of low volatility on the business. Drew mentioned the transaction between Sequent and Golden Triangle Storage and I’ll provide you with a bit more detail. During the second quarter, Sequent executed a 2 Bcf storage agreement with GTS Cavern 1, effective June 1, 2011 for a five-year term. Sequent continues to focus on servicing the core gas-fire generation market as well as expanding its other customer business in Texas. So acquiring well located Texas storage capacity makes sense. This new GTS storage lease along with Sequent’s other contractual assets in Texas will allow Sequent to continue to grow this business. Further, Sequent adds to the reputable customer portfolio that GTS is cultivating and that it’s an active participant providing gas supply services to the wholesale market. In addition to the Sequent contract, we’ve signed third-party contracts such that GTS Cavern 1 is now fully contracted at a blended rate of approximately $0.14 and that includes the Sequent transaction. Jefferson Island is 93% contracted with an average subscription rate of $0.19 and that also includes an existing contract with Sequent which has been in place since 2007. On the construction and development front, we continue to make good progress on the second Cavern at Golden Triangle Storage and remain on track to have it in service in early 2012. The preliminary process for expansion at Jefferson Island is also ongoing, although further capital spending on storage projects will depend on storage market conditions. As most of you know, third and fourth quarters are always important ones for Sequent, SouthStar and Pivotal. So Pete, Mike, Dana and their teams will be executing on the core business strategies while looking for market opportunities to generate additional economic value. Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, we’ve had a good start to the year in terms of operating and financial performance. We remain on track with the Nicor merger approval process and we look forward to providing additional updates as they become available. On behalf of our employees at AGL Resources, we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of our Company. Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
34,GV_001837_2012Q2,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 AGL Resources, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Pam, and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Cave, Treasurer. Please proceed. Steve Cave Former Senior VP of Finance & Treasurer Okay. Thank you and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning to review our second quarter 2012 earnings results. Normally, you would expect that Sarah Stashak would be moderating this call, but we are happy to share that Sarah is the proud mother of a new baby boy born this past weekend. We are all very excited for her, and we look forward to having her back a little bit later this year. Joining me on the call today from our distribution operations headquarters here in Naperville, Illinois are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here and available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-Qs for both, AGL Resources and Nicor Gas are available on our website. You can access these materials by visiting aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from the actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Qs, and they are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filings. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our presentation as well as on our website. So we will begin the call today with some prepared remarks before taking your questions and I will turn it over to Drew to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks, Steve. Congratulations, Sarah. Good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.28 for the combined enterprise, including the legacy Nicor Gas businesses. On an adjusted basis, which excludes $2 million of after-tax costs incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, diluted earnings per share were $0.30 which compares to $0.33 in the second quarter of 2011. The primary year-over-year driver of our second quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the second quarter of 2011 GAAP comparisons. Our business performed well during the quarter, but did reflect a $0.02 per share negative impact during the quarter due to continued warmer-than-normal weather. Turning briefly to Slide 4, you can see that our year-to-date financial results for the first 2 quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.47, down from $1.96 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the declines are again, the unprecedented warmer-than normal-weather which had a $0.13 impact on our earnings results year-to-date. Weaker results at the wholesale business and increases in the number of shares outstanding following the completion of merger, these were partially offset by the addition of the Nicor businesses. On Slide 5, you can see that approximately 77% of the total consolidated operating EBIT for the first 6 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations accounted for 19% year-to-date, wholesale services, 3% and mid stream moderations, 1%. I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. EBIT was up $26 million, compared to the second quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $20 million from Nicor Gas. The warm weather had a negative EBIT effect of approximately $4 million during the quarter across our distribution businesses. We are starting to see benefits from our shared service model accrue across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we used to gauge this is O&M expense per customer. For the first 6 months of 2012, O&M per customer was $69, down from $75 per customer for the same period in 2011. These numbers are adjusted to exclude rider investment programs where there is a corresponding revenue offset to associated expense. We are also seeing additional improvement for our non-regulated businesses. Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7, we reported EBIT for the second quarter of $14 million, a $13 million increase compared to the second quarter of last year. This large increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail business to our portfolio. Those businesses are less seasonal than the SouthStar business that historically was the company's entire retail operating segment. You will find second quarter 2012 results for our wholesale service segment on Slide 8. EBIT was down $4 million year-over-year for the second quarter. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from a $6 million reduction in commercial activity versus the second quarter of 2011 due to ongoing low volatility in the storage and transportation spreads. We also recorded transportation hedge gains of $18 million during the quarter, a $14 million increase over the last year and storage hedge losses of $9 million as compared to $4 million of storage hedge gains last year, a $13 million negative year-over-year impact. These 2 factors play a role in our expectations for the remainder of the year for the wholesale segment, and John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes. As you can see, we have a significant storage rollout schedule of $47 million that we expect to recognize in operating revenues about equally between the remainder of 2012 and 2013. This is an increase of $28 million over the rollout scheduled at the end of the first quarter of 2012 and a $36 million improvement, as compared to this time last year. Now let's move to Slide 9. EBIT at our midstream segment was $2 million during the second quarter of 2012, flat compared to the prior year. As a reminder, we re-contracted 3 Bcf of capacity at Jefferson Island starting April 1. Due to the continued challenging market conditions and pressure on storage pricing, this dropped our average rate for the facility from $0.19 to $0.14. You can see the blended rates for Golden Triangle and Central Valley on the chart at the bottom right side of the page. Though we have seen a slight improvement in storage rates for shorter duration contracts, we continue to evaluate options for locking in additional capacity at Central Valley and Golden Triangle Cavern 2. Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the second quarter of 2012. While revenues per unit were down, TEU, or 20-foot equivalent unit, shipments and market share are up relative to the same period last year, reflecting tropical strong profile in the region and efficient management of its business. We were breakeven for the year-to-date period on an EBIT basis for that segment as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense resulting from purchase accounting fair value adjustments that were required as part of the merger. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and additional Nicor debt we assumed upon closing the transaction. Those factors were the main drivers of the year-over-year increase in interest expense. We are generally on plan for capital expenditures this year with a significant portion of our utility capital investment dedicated to rider or surcharge programs with minimal regulatory lag. We continue to look for similar opportunities to deploy capital of property utility franchises. Finally, as a reminder we provide earnings per share guidance estimated based on normal weather among other assumptions. As noted in the earnings release on a reported EPS basis, our earnings could fall below our guidance range, which is $2.80 to $2.95 per share, as a result of weather and tax year-to-date. Thanks for your time. I will turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Drew, and good morning. As Drew noted, we reported solid operating results during the second quarter despite some continued impact of warmer-than-normal weather into the early part of the second quarter. On Slide 11, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities year-to-date with Illinois and Georgia highlighted, as these are the 2 service territories where we have the most weather exposure. With the unprecedented warm weather that impacted us in the first quarter and the lesser negative weather impact into the second quarter, we have a negative year-to-date weather impact of $0.13 per share. We remain focused on controlling expenses across the corporation, and we are seeing positive trends in that regard in several of our businesses. Moving to Slide 12, let me briefly update you on a regulatory filing that we made in New Jersey last week related to infrastructure improvements at Elizabethtown Gas. As you may recall, our utility infrastructure enhancement, or UIE program, is set to expire at the end of October. We have requested approval for a new accelerated capital investment plan called AIR, accelerated infrastructure replacement, where we propose to spend up to $135 million over a 5-year period beginning in November of this year. Under the proposed plan, we would replace nearly 150 miles of pipe that is predominantly aging cast iron. Several of peers in New Jersey have requested infrastructure programs of similar duration. However, it is uncertain at this time how the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities will view our proposal. The program we have proposed is consistent with our commitment to prudently invest capital on infrastructure programs that have minimum regulatory lag and enhance the reliability and integrity of our distribution system. I want to take a few minutes to talk about the performance of the wholesale segment. Turning to Slides 13 and 14, you can see an historical look at our storage rollout schedule along with the chart of current and historic storage spreads, reflecting the year-over-year wider storage spreads, in part due to the market needing an outlet for natural gas supply. We have continued to improve the locked-in value of our storage rollout by capturing the year-over-year higher storage spreads by injecting gas and by rolling our storage positions to later periods. The storage hedge losses we experienced in the second quarter added to the locked in storage rollout value at the end of the quarter. As Drew noted, our storage rollout value has improved to $47 million on about 55 Bcf of natural gas inventory. Currently, we expect to recognize about half of these operating revenues in 2012, with the remainder expected to be recognized in 2013. As you can see on the chart, this is one of the strongest rollout schedules we have had in Sequent's history. In our 10-Q filed this morning we have provided information about the impact of forward natural gas price changes on our storage portfolio. Based on Sequent's current projection of year-end storage positions at December 31, 2012 of about 25 Bcf, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in a $24 million reduction to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount. Conversely, a $1 decrease in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in $24 million increase to Sequent's reported operating revenues for this year. However, additional lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustments could potentially offset a portion of the positive impact. I do want to point out that the situation with our transportation hedges is a bit different, however. Due to narrowing basis spreads, we accelerated transportation hedge gains of approximately $20 million into the first half of this year, primarily from the second half of 2012 through 2013. As a result, our storage hedge gains were strong on a year-over-year basis, but the portfolio is likely to be challenged for the remainder of the year unless basis widens. On the whole, Pete and his team have done an excellent job of managing the portfolio to create as much economic value as possible in a challenging market environment. They will continue to monitor market conditions and look for opportunities that capture additional margin. With respect to our earnings guidance for 2012, as Drew noted, the weather impact we have seen year-to-date could move us below the low end of our guidance range for the year. Other than the weather impact, we see performance in the rest of our businesses that is in line with our expectations. This is due to a number of positive indicators we have seen through the first half of the year including cost containment and managing our controllable expenses, achieving our merger savings targets and generating incremental economic value in our wholesale business. Turning to Slide 15, you will find our priorities and objectives for 2012. These have not changed from our prior discussion and we continue to make solid progress in all areas. Again, with the exception of weather, we are demonstrating solid results across our business units and we have reason for optimism as we look ahead to the remainder of 2012. On behalf of the employees of AGL resources, we want to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of the Company. Operator, I will turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
35,GV_001837_2013Q2,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 AGL Resources Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chantaley, and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Sara Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Okay. Thank you. Thanks to everyone for joining us this morning to review our second quarter 2013 results. Joining me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-Q are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-Q filing. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of these measures to the GAAP financials is available on the appendix of our presentation as well as on our website. We'll begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I'll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with a recap of second quarter results, and then I'll turn it over to John for some additional remarks. Before I dig into the numbers at a high level, we have benefited in the first half of 2013 by the return to more normal weather as compared to historically warm weather in 2012. Excluding weather, we achieved growth in our operating margins during the first half of the year, primarily as a result of continued investment in our regulated infrastructure programs, targeted acquisition growth in retail operations and higher contribution from commercial activity in our wholesale segment. We continue to effectively manage costs and leverage our shared services model across our business to largely overcome inflationary effects. As expected, our operations and maintenance expense in 2013 increased as a result of returning to targeted levels in incentive compensation. And bad debt expenses increased modestly for some of our businesses as a result of colder weather and higher natural gas prices compared to 2012. However, excluding these items as well as additional expense associated with the acquisition of warranty customers earlier this year, our O&M expenses decreased slightly, and we continue to maintain our focus on controlling costs. Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation, you can see that we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $0.41. This compares to $0.30 in the second quarter of 2012 when you exclude merger expenses related to the Nicor transaction. The primary year-over-year drivers of the $0.11 increase were improved commercial activity in our wholesale services segment, the previously disclosed sale of Compass, which added $0.04 during the quarter and additional margin improvement of approximately $0.04 at distribution operations. Slightly colder-than-normal weather resulted in a $0.02 positive impact across our distribution and retail segments during the quarter. Excluding wholesale services, diluted EPS was $0.38 for the quarter, which compares to $0.35 in the second quarter of 2012. Consolidated EBIT was up 29% year-over-year, driven by improvements in our distribution and wholesale segments. Retail operations and cargo shipping were in line with last year's second quarter, and EBIT for midstream operations declined by $2 million year-over-year. On Slide 4, you'll find our consolidated results for the year through June. The solid results in the second quarter built on a very strong first quarter through June. Consolidated EBIT increased 18% year-over- year with improvements in all segments, excluding midstream operations. Our distribution retail segments together contributed 94% of operating EBIT through the first 6 months of this year. We currently expect full-year consolidated EPS to be near the high end of our $2.50 to $2.70 guidance range. Excluding wholesale services, we expect to achieve diluted EPS near or above our previously provided guidance range of $2.40 to $2.50 per share. While we are tracking in line with our targets for the wholesale business, mark-to-market accounting movements on transportation and storage hedges associated with this segment made consolidated GAAP EPS for the full year more difficult to forecast. John will walk you through some of the major factors impacting our view on guidance in a few minutes. Taking a closer look at each segment, a snapshot of second quarter EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 5. EBIT was up $9 million compared to the second quarter of 2012. This is mainly driven by increased margin from our infrastructure replacement programs and increased customer usage. It also includes an improvement of $1 million at Nicor Gas related to weather that was normal in the second quarter of 2013 versus weather that was warmer than normal in 2012. For the first half of the year, the main drivers of the $33 million year-over-year EBIT improvement was weather during the first quarter that was 34% colder than the record warm weather we experienced in the first quarter of 2012. Our customer count remains stable and reflects a slight increase year-over-year. Before leaving this slide, I also want to mention that at the end of June, we executed a weather hedge related to our weather exposure in Illinois, specifically the purchase of a put option that allows us to retain upside potential should the fourth quarter be colder than normal but largely mitigates our downside risk in the event of significant warmer-than-normal weather. As we discussed in our analyst day, our primary exposure to weather in the distribution operations segment is at Nicor Gas since we do not have weather normalization mechanisms in place. In order to reduce the potential for negative fourth quarter 2013 earnings impacts from weather, we thought it would be prudent to enter into this cost-effective transaction. We will also evaluate options for mitigating our weather risk in future periods on a continual basis. Turning to retail slide -- retail segment on Slide 6, we recorded EBIT for the second quarter of $12 million, down just slightly for the second quarter -- compared to the second quarter of 2012. For the first half of the year, EBIT for the segment increased $8 million year-over-year. Operations and maintenance expense increased 28% year-over-year for the quarter and 11% for the first half of the year, due primarily to the acquisition of approximately 500,000 warranty contracts in January of this year. Our market share in the Georgia retail business remains stable at 32%, and in our retail services business, the number of warranty contracts we are serving is up substantially year-over-year due to the acquisition I just mentioned. We made another opportunistic acquisition to retail business at the end of June. In this instance, we acquired approximately 33,000 residential and commercial customer relationships in Illinois. These are natural gas commodity customers who opt for competitive service in the state. We paid $32 million for the block of customers, and we expect the acquisition to add $0.02 to diluted EPS in 2013 and additional $0.04 in 2014. Effectively, we paid about 3x forecasted 2014 EBITDA, and we are adding margin with very little additional operating expense. You'll find second quarter 2013 results for our wholesale services segment on Slide 7. EBIT of $11 million for the quarter is up $20 million from our reported EBIT in the second quarter of 2012. The $20 million variance is driven by an $11 million gain on the sale of Compass Energy, as we previously disclosed, and a $13 million improvement in commercial activity. For the first half of the year, EBIT, the wholesale segment, has improved by $16 million year-over-year, driven primarily by the gain on the sale of Compass as well as stronger commercial activity. Through June, we recorded hedge losses net of lower costs or market adjustments of $8 million compared to hedge gains net of LOCOM of $21 million in the same period of 2012. The storage rollout schedule at the end of June was $14 million compared to $47 million at the end of the same period in 2012. The $33 million year-over-year reduction is reflective of the modernization of many of our storage positions as we withdrew natural gas from storage in the first half of this year. We continue to see good O&M expense discipline in this business segment with operating expenses down 7% year-to-date. Now let's move to Slide 8. The midstream segment declined -- decline year-over-year is due largely to the roll-off of legacy contracts that were above current market rates as well as higher depreciation, property taxes and other storage-related expenses due to additional facilities and service when compared to the second quarter of last year. As we have mentioned previously, market fundamentals remain challenging for this business segment due to low natural gas price volatility, abundant market supplies and associated low seasonal storage spreads. As a result, when contracts expire, we have been either recontracting at lower rates reflective of the current market or utilizing in-house management capabilities to optimize the assets until conditions improve to support longer-term contracts. Briefly, you can see results for the cargo shipping segment on Slide 9. Second quarter results were in line with the prior year second quarter, and through June, the segment is up about $1 million compared to last year. As a reminder, fourth quarter is when substantially all of the segment's operating income is expected due to the seasonal nature of the business. Importantly, we continue to improve market share and utilization with volume that is higher by 11% year-over-year through June. However, the rate per 20-foot equivalent unit, or TEU, has fallen modestly due to pricing action taken last summer as well as changes in cargo mix and competition in the region. That said, we are starting to see improvements in rate as we move through the year. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our debt-to-capitalization improved modestly from quarter-to-quarter. Interest expense was up by $1 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2012, largely reflective of the $500 million debt issuance that we completed in May. In that transaction, we issued a 30-year senior note at a 4.4% fixed interest rate, which is well below our weighted average cost of long-term debt. Through the first 6 months, our margin growth combined with ongoing expense discipline has resulted in strong performance in nearly every business segment. We are very pleased with the foundation -- this foundation, and we'll use it as a platform for continued positive developments over the remainder of the year. Thank you for your time today. Now I'll turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Drew. As we noted, our year-over-year performance is very strong, due in part to the fact that we had the warmest year on record last year. But even when you exclude the year-over-year weather impact, we are off to a great start in 2013 due to our ongoing infrastructure investment programs, slightly better customer growth than we expected and our continued focus on expenses, which is enhanced by our shared services model. As Drew mentioned, at this point, we expect to be near the high end of our consolidated EPS guidance range and near or above the high end of our EPS guidance range, excluding wholesale services. Let me summarize the main drivers. First, we have about a $0.05 benefit due to colder-than-normal weather across our distribution and retail businesses through June. And with the weather hedge that we executed, our exposure to warmer-than- normal weather in the fourth quarter is largely mitigated with the potential for upside should we see colder-than-normal temperatures at the beginning of the winter heating season. Second, we recorded the $0.04 gain on the sale of Compass during the second quarter. Third, the acquisition at the end of the second quarter of additional retail customers in Illinois is expected to add about $0.02 this year. And fourth, our pension and retiree welfare plan expenses are estimated to be lower than our initial expectations, benefiting earnings per share by $0.03 for the year. These discrete items are in addition to our effective cost control and slight margin improvements relative to expectations across most of our business segments. And I'll just reiterate Drew's comment that mark- to-market accounting related to storage and transportation hedge movements can have a meaningful impact on our wholesale business, making it more difficult to forecast results for that segment on a GAAP basis. That said, at this point in the year, even excluding the gain on sale of Compass, we are on track to achieve our full year EBIT guidance range of $25 million to $35 million for the segment. We had a very busy quarter with regard to legislative and regulatory developments, and I'll highlight some of these, starting on Slide 11. In Illinois, 2 impactful pieces of legislation were approved by the general assembly in May, and one was signed into law by the governor in July. The first item noted here is the new law which creates the opportunity for infrastructure investment surcharge to be collected by gas utilities in Illinois serving more than 700,000 customers, which includes Nicor Gas. In our case, this means that we can deploy -- potentially deploy up to $150 million annually to upgrade our pipeline system. However, an exact amount has yet to be determined and must be filed with the ICC, which we expect to occur in 2014. In order to claim full recovery of capital deployed under this program, we would still be required to spend approximately $200 million in capital under base rates, which is roughly our 5-year average CapEx at Nicor Gas. So we would be looking at about $200 million of CapEx, which would remain subject to normal rate-setting process and potentially an additional $150 million under the new surcharge program. But the exact amount, of course, is yet to be determined. Any rider-based program rates could not take effect until January 2015 for Nicor Gas. The second item noted here is related to our depreciation rate. The current depreciation rate for Nicor Gas is 4.1%. This rate has been in effect for over 2 decades and is in need of review. The depreciation study is nearly complete, and we expect to file it with the Illinois Commerce Commission by the end of August. We estimate that each 10 basis point reduction could result in lower depreciation expense of between $4 million and $6 million. The legislation is pending before the governor, and he has until August 18 to sign or veto the bill. If he takes no action, it would become law on that date. A lower depreciation rate would not impact customer rates, and it would provide an incentive to increase capital expenditures in our Nicor Gas service territory, creating more jobs in the state of Illinois and the communities that we serve. The $200 million annually that we currently spend on base capital expenditures at Nicor Gas is just slightly above annual depreciation expense at the 4.1% depreciation rate. As a reminder, under the legislation, any change in depreciation rate would become effective as of the date that the depreciation study is filed. Accordingly, assuming approval this year, some EPS uplift could be anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2013, with the full-year impact beginning in 2014. Our current EPS guidance does not assume an impact from a modified depreciation rate as we have yet to file the study with the ICC, and a review period would follow. Moving to Slide 12. Also in Illinois, we continued to see progress in bringing the long-running performance base rate, or PBR, case to conclusion. On June 7, the ICC issued an order requiring that a $72 million refund be issued to current customers over a 12-month period. And we began issuing these refunds on July 1. We have already accrued this amount as a contingent liability on our balance sheet, though we have contested the decision as our stipulated agreement with the ICC staff was for $64 million. Other parties to the case have until August 19 to contest the ruling. The matter remains before the appellate court. Moving on to key items in our other jurisdictions on Slide 13. In Georgia, we are working on Phase 2 of our STRIDE program related to pipeline enhancements and system expansions at Atlanta Gas Light. Phase 1 began over 10 years ago, and most of the programs sunset in 2013. With our bare steel and cast iron replacement now largely complete, we are looking to replace aging plastic pipeline in our footprint. We have filed an agreement with staff and expect a ruling from the Georgia Commission in early August on our request to replace 750 miles of plastic pipe. The aggregate cost of this program is approximately $275 million, and the program would conclude at the end of 2017. Also, under the STRIDE umbrella, tomorrow, we expect to file an updated construction and investment plan for continued system reinforcement and customer growth projects. These programs would account for an additional $260 million in capital expenditures over a 4-year period, and we expect the ruling by November 1. I'll also briefly mention that we continue to work towards approval of Elizabethtown Gas' infrastructure program in New Jersey and hope to reach a settlement in the coming weeks. I have just provided a lot of detail on these infrastructure programs, and if you turn to Slide 14, you can see the bigger picture of what this means for our utility CapEx over time. As the new programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown will be in their start-up phases, we are forecasting a decline in capital spending at our utilities for 2014. However, as spending under these programs ramp up and based on our plans to initiate an infrastructure investment program in Illinois, you can see that we expect significant uplift in 2015. These are all important programs for maintaining the safety and reliability of our system, and the rider-based programs have minimal regulatory lag for cost recovery. As I mentioned on our last call, we continue to evaluate options for meeting our natural gas supply and infrastructure needs in Georgia. We remain in discussions with potential partners about taking an equity stake in an interstate pipeline project. A significant capital investment would be good, stable cash flow into investment returns that are generally in line with our regulated returns in our utility businesses. We are nearing the decision point and hope to share details with you imminently. Again, we are off to a great start in 2013, and we have made meaningful progress in many of our jurisdictions on key regulatory and legislative priorities. We still have a lot of work to do the remainder of the year to further build on our successes. And we look forward to reporting back to you at the end of the third quarter. We thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources. Operator, I'll turn the call back to you at this time for the Q&A session."
36,GV_001837_2008Q3,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Natalya and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Cave, Managing Director of Investment Relations. Please proceed, sir. Steve Cave All right, thank you, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our third quarter 2008 earnings results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We have several other members of our management team here with us today to answer your questions following the prepared remarks. As you know we issued our earnings release and filed 10-Q this morning. If you don't have a copy of those already, you can find copies on our website. Before we move on to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The various factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and our 10-Q filing and are more fully described in our most recent 10- K filing. We also use some non-GAAP measures such as EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes, and operating margin in describing our business and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available on our website and in our earnings release, SEC filings. In addition to the non-GAAP measures in our earnings release we provided consolidated earnings results that exclude the impacts of hedge gains, losses in our wholesale services segment and also excluding the required inventory valuation adjustments for our wholesale services and retail energy segment. These are as you know also non-GAAP results that we believe will provide more transparency around the business and enable better comparisons between reporting periods. We provide a reconciliation of those to the financials on our website. We'll begin today's call with some prepared remarks and then we'll open the lines to take your questions and with that let me turn it over to John. John W. Somerhalder II Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am going to spend a few minutes talking about results for the quarter and the year-to-date as well as our guidance for the remainder of the year, then give you an update on a couple of other items. Our EPS results for the third quarter were $0.85 compared to $0.17 during the third quarter of last year. As you know we reported a loss of the second quarter of this year as result of the rising prices during the quarter that resulted in accounting losses and hedges we had in place for Sequent. By the time of our second quarter earnings call in late July we already have started to see significant price declines and we noted on the call that if prices continue to move downward we would expect to recover, in the third quarter, substantially all of these hedge losses. That is exactly what happened and as a result our earnings are significantly higher than the third quarter of last year. The other factor affecting third quarter earnings is that in a declining price environment we are required to value our natural gas inventory at the lower of a weighted average cost for the prevailing market price. This is below our cost of market or LOCOM inventory valuation adjustment. In the third quarter the LOCOM adjustment was $34 million for Sequent and $80 million for SouthStar. Keep in mind that the negative impact of earnings in the current period caused by LOCOM will be offset when the gas is withdrawn and delivered in future periods. However a significant portion up to about $0.10 per share of the SouthStar LOCOM adjustment will not be realized until the first quarter of 2009. As a result, while we expect our earnings results from an economic standpoint to be within the guidance range we provided previously and that was between $2.75 to $2.85 per share. We do expect that this LOCOM adjustment will cause our reported GAAP earnings for the year to be lower by about $0.10 per share. Adjusting for the impacts of hedged gains in LOCOM, our earnings for the third quarter and that's on this adjusted basis were $0.28 per share compared with $0.09 per share for the third quarter of last year. On that same basis, earnings year-to-date were $1.87 per share which is $0.10 higher than the $1.77 per share for the first quarter or for the first three quarters of last year. We clearly have had some accounting impacts from natural gas price movements. But we feel very good about fundamentals of our business and from an economic standpoint, our businesses in total had performed about where we expected, despite the challenging economic conditions. As you know, our utility business continues to be impacted by the general economic conditions and a slow housing market. Year-to-date our growth has been virtually flat in that business as compared to last year. We also have seen some additional bad debt expense particularly in New Jersey and some in Virginia which is a function of a higher prices earlier in the year and the downturn in the economy. We have been able to offset some of those negative impacts with aggressive O&M expense reductions but we expect that with the continuation of the challenging economic conditions and that is our current expectation. We expect that we'll continue to see relatively flat results throughout 2009 in that business. Turning to our capital projects; I will start with Hampton Roads Crossing project, HRX project in Virginia. Construction is on schedule and within budget for HRX. And we just recently completed one of the most interesting and difficult aspects of the project that's a 7000 plus for directional drill under the Elizabeth River. We had purchased much of the steel and another materials needed for the project and as a result our exposure to any rise in commodity prices is now limited on this project. We continue to make significant progress on Golden Triangle Storage at the project and around Vermont, Texas. Construction of GTS continues to be on schedule and our costs are within the range we previously discussed with you. We have some minor, we did have some minor damages from the hurricanes in September, but nothing had caused any material delay or cost increases. And with the progress we have made to date on the cavern well, the brine disposal wells in the surface facilities including the leech plant, we expect to move to a very important phase of the project and that is leech of cavern number one as early as in the middle of December. Earlier this year we discussed the potential new salt-dome storage project located in the Gulf Coast region. At the time we were too early in the development project to share many details about the project. I can now tell you that this project is on the salt-dome in Louisiana and we have named it Triple Diamond Storage. We secured the potential site and have advanced that project to the point of doing the initial size of re-testing of the dome and all indications so far are positive about the geology of the site and similar to the Golden Triangle location, it had some significant competitive advantages and that it conserve a number of major Gulf Coast pipelines, pipelines like Tennessee type better transport and including Golden Pass in Gulf South and that's still a fairly small a header systems only about 30 mile gather system. However, in light of the current economic conditions we do not plan to move forward on this project this time. We still believe in the strong fundamentals of the storage business and plan to take the necessary steps to preserve the options we have to develop this project in the future. As we allocate and prioritize our capital in this current economic environment we will place the highest priority on regulated projects in our distribution operations business where projects with a more regulated quality of earnings or projects that support or provide services to some of our own utilities. A good example is our Magnolia pipeline project which will provide transportation of reclassified LNG from Elba Island to Atlanta Gas Light in the making in Atlanta areas. We have received Georgia PSC and court approvals and have ordered major equipment and that is primarily compression in the third quarter and are moving forward with this $48 million project. In summary, even though we have decided to not move forward with our Triple Diamond Storage dollar project. We plan to preserve the options to develop this project at a later date. More importantly, we have made significant progress on three of our growth projects during the third quarter; on Hampton Roads Crossing, Golden Triangle Storage and Magnolia. With that I will turn it to Drew for financial discussion. Andrew W. Evans Thanks John. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As we point out in our disclosures and as John discussed clearly the hedge gains at Sequent had a dramatic positive effect on earnings in the quarter offset somewhat by the LOCOM adjustments for Sequent and SouthStar as prices continue to decline in the quarter. It's really the inverse of what we saw in the second quarter where the rise in natural gas prices resulted in significant hedge losses that resulted in our reporting of loss for that quarter. So I'll start with wholesale since it has the most moving parts. If you look at the table in the presentation and on page 28 of the 10-Q you will see the reconciling items. You can see that the gains on storage and transportation hedges combined were $117 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $11 million during the same quarter last year, where natural gas prices during the quarter were decreasing but not with at the rate that we saw this year. You will also see the $34 million LOCOM adjustment that resulted from valuing our national gas inventory and storage at market prices which were lower than the average weighted price we paid to buy the gas. In the third quarter of 2007, that adjustment was only $1 million, so there is a $33 million differential year-over-year. If you think about our standard operation of segment these movements can be highly anticipated, we inject gas into the ground in the summer and locking a margin by selling a forward contract. GAAP or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require us to mark the forward contract both up and down as prices fall and rise. On the inventory side our price decreased below the weighted average cost of our inventory requires us to write down the inventory to its current market value. Once written down the inventory cannot be adjusted back up if prices subsequently increase. In most instances a decrease in price will increase the value before the forward sale and be substantially offset by decrease in the value of the inventory. In opposite occurrence increasing prices will cause us to report a loss on the forward contract. In no case, as the underlying profitability of the position changed, its just at the full value of the storage transaction is not completely realized until the gas in storage is delivered. The commercial activity line which is generally the way you can gauge economic value created and recognized during a particular period shows good improvement over last year up $16 million. This reflects a combination of hotter than normal weather in July and some additional opportunities during and immediately following the hurricanes in September. The inventory rollout schedule on page 24 of the 10-Q gives you our best current view of when we expect to realize the future economic value of Sequent storage portfolio. As you can see we expect 7 million of storage margin in the fourth quarter of 2008 and about 5 million for the first quarter of 2009. That assumes no major changes to the injection withdrawal plans which is primarily a function of regional price movements. Just cutting through all the noise though, the important take away is that Sequent is up, is tracking about where we expect it to be for the year. Turning to the retail energy segment, SouthStar as you know the third quarter is not typically a big earnings driver for that business at least from an operating standpoint. The real drivers this quarter were the low comp adjustments that John talked about which was $18 million, which is $14 million just net of minority interest and as he said a significant portion of that will not be recovered until 2009. SouthStar had lower operating expenses for the quarter as a result of lower outside services and marketing expenses. We continue to monitor bad debt expense closely but the trends have continued to track consistent with historical trends and therefore we have not seen anything that is out of line with our expectations. We've already discussed the big drivers in distribution ops and the fact that we've seen lower customer growth and a little bit higher bad debt expense. As a result operating margin for the quarter was down $2 million. Our bad debt expense was about 3 million higher than during the same quarter last year and that was primarily concentrated in the New Jersey and Virginia utilities. That said, our Distribution Operations business will generate more than $800 million worth of operating margin in any given year. The increase in bad debt is quite small relative to this number. This is reflective of the business that is much less sensitive to credit losses than most due principally to the market design in Georgia. Our share holders continue to benefit from regulatory and market diversification across our jurisdictions. Before we go to Q&A, I will take just one further mix, one further observation about credit and capital deployment. Our size gives us an advantage in sourcing capital. We maintain sizable buffers, built significant liquid inventories and have excellent diversification across our bank group. We had no exposure to Lehmann or Merrill, the former by design in any business unit. We have not seen material consolidation in our bank group with the exception of Wachovia and Wells Fargo. In early summer we anticipated growing our credit capacity to maintain capital buffers in a high gas price environment. We are able to execute that expansion without any problem in the midst of a current credit crisis. We have not need to alter our credit facility as its maturities is three years out. Prospectively we are seeing declines in natural gas prices, this spurts well for customers and we are likely [inaudible] to deliver the majority of our gas out of the inventory. We normally see short term borrowing pulled zero by the end of the winter heating season. On the capital side as John discussed we'll continue to be prudent about its deployment. We'll focus first on a regulated enterprises on our utility customers. We believe our focus on regulated investments most of assets which serve our customer base is more highly valued by investors. We'll preserve our options around development or sale of assets as preferences of our shareholders and capital markets evolved. I think that covers the highlights so with that let's go to questions. Question And Answer"
37,GV_001837_2009Q3,"Presentation Unknown Speaker <strong>Operator</strong> Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AGL Resources Third Quarter 2009 Earning Conference Call. My name is Gina and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's, Mr. Steve Cave, Vice President of Finance. Please proceed. <strong>Steve Cave</strong> Okay. Thanks Gina and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our third quarter 2009 earnings results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. As always, we have several other members of our management team here with us today to answer questions following the prepared remarks. As you know, we issued our earnings release and filed our Form 10-Q this morning, before the market opens. If you don't have copies of those documents, you can find those on our website. And before we move to the prepared remarks, let me just remind you that our discussions today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release, in our 10-Q, and are more fully described in our most recent 10-K filing. We also used some non-GAAP measures in describing our business and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials available in our earnings release and our SEC filings on our web site. We will begin today's call with some prepared remarks, and then we will open the lines to take your questions. And with that let me turn it over to John. <strong>John W. Somerhalder II</strong> Thanks Steve and good morning. As you know, today we reported earnings of $0.16 per diluted share for the third quarter. Last year at the third quarter, we reported $0.85 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter was a period in which we reported significant gains on storage hedges at Sequent, as a result of gas price movements in that quarter. Gas price volatility was much lower this year, and hedge moments were significantly lower for the second and third quarters this year. Movement between quarters is going to occur based on the way we are required to account for hedges. So, we will focus on full year-to-date reserves for a more meaningful comparison. Through the first three quarters of this year, we reported $1.97 per diluted share, which is $0.10 ahead of last year's results for the same period. We previously had provided earnings guidance for this year in the range of $2.65 to $2.75 per share. Based on our results year-to-date and some of the future economic value created by Sequent that Drew will discuss, we are on track to achieve earning results at the high end of that range or possibly slightly higher. These solid financial results reflect good performance from each of our business units this year relative to our expectations. Drew will walk you through some of the major drivers for our results in each business unit in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to briefly provide an update of our progress this quarter on several major initiatives. On regulatory front, we received approval from the Georgia PSC and early October for our STRIDE program, which is an infrastructure program, primarily in the Metro Atlanta region. We submitted plans for a ten-year program that would cost approximately $400 million. The commission approved the first face of that program, which is a three-year investment of about $176 million. The STRIDE program is an important part of our long-term utility infrastructure plan, as it will enable us to improve system performance and reliability in several areas of the Metro Atlanta region that have been strained by rapid growth and development. From a cost recovery standpoint, it was important to us to put in place a plan that would support infrastructure development, while minimizing regulatory lag. Also on the regulatory front, our rate case in New Jersey is ongoing and we continue to expect a resolution in the fourth quarter of this year. We have now received approval from the Georgia Public Service Commission to purchase the 15% additional ownership interest in the SouthStar joint venture. The PSC approval was the only regulatory approval we needed. So, we are now on track to close the $58 million transaction with Piedmont on January on January 1, 2010. Turning to our major capital projects, we continue to make good progress on both our regulated and our unregulated pipeline in storage projects. Our Hampton Roads Crossing, or what we call our HRX project, in Virginia, continues to go well with only a few minor construction delays. We anticipate putting that project into commercial operations in December. Construction on our Golden Triangle storage facility in Texas also continues to go well and we are expecting to have the first cavern of that project online in the third quarter of 2010. The Magnolia Project in Georgia is on schedule to close and begin service at the end of this week. You may recall that this project is about $46 million investment, which includes the purchase of an undivided interest in some of Southern Natural Gas assets that we are combining with existing Atlanta Gaslight distribution pipeline to create a firm transportation path into the Atlanta market from the Elba Island LMG facility. The result will be that we will have an additional 84,000 [deca-thermos] per day of capacity available to serve our customers. I think those are the major highlights for the quarter. So with that I will turn it over to Drew for the financial review. <strong>Andrew W. Evans</strong> Thanks John. And good morning everyone. I will cover a few of the major earnings drivers for the quarter and the year with a bias toward more of the year-to-date results for the reasons that John described. Being sensitive to the fact that there are a number of earnings calls going on in the utilities space today, I will try to keep my comments brief, so we can get to your questions. As Steve mentioned we've put out 10-Q in conjunction with our earnings release, which is our normal practice and you should be able to find most of the quarterly details in there if you need them. Also, I will cover each of the business segments, as I cover each of the segments, I will discuss the major drivers, but not all of the reconciling items. You can find some very good schedules in the results of operation segment of our MD&A that reconcile you back to reported EBIT for each business unit. In both the distribution and retail segments, keep in mind the third quarter is typically a shoulder period for us, representing only about 15% of our earnings in that period. The real story year-to-date is in distribution, is that operating margin is up $16 million, primarily as a result of carrying higher priced inventory on behalf of the marketers in Georgia and higher revenue from our pipeline improvement project in Atlanta Gas Light. If you recall, when we store gas in our system on behalf of the marketers in Georgia, we collect carrying charges on that inventory and since inventory levels and costs have been higher this year, our margins from that activity are higher than last year. We've also incurred higher cost of carrying it on their behalf. Further, we have seen margin benefit from our regulatory efforts in Virginia that's the decoupling measure that was passed this year. We've also seen an increase in utility operations expensed year-to-date, primarily as a result of higher depreciation expense, as well as higher pension post retirement expenses. Hank and his team have done a great job of holding in line on discretionary operating costs, particularly during a time when we were challenged by the market impacts of flat-to-negative customer growth, but clearly these two items have had the largest impact on us from an expense standpoint. In the retail business, which is SouthStar, our EBIT year-to-date is up $19 million, compared to last year, about 12 million of that increase reflects lower-of-cost-or-market or low-COM adjustments year-over-year. The remainder is due primarily to higher contribution from the Ohio market, as well as an increase in the average customer usage. John mentioned the continued aggressive competition we've seen in the Georgia market and we don't see that abating any time soon. One impact is, we continue to see changes in the mix of retail customers with respect to fixed price plans versus variable price plans and that has impacted our margins as has a slightly lower customer count year-over-year. Mike Braswell's here today and his team has made some investments in more aggressive marketing this year in an effort to minimize the market share impact and will continue to monitor these impacts of those initiatives through the winter heating season. Let's turn to wholesale, that's clearly the largest driver for quarterly results and here I will focus on some of the reconciling items for the quarter as well as the year. As you know, we have to record changes in fair value of hedges that we use to lock in profits for gas- stored underground. We're required to mark those hedges without regard to the underlying gas. And in general, as prices rise, we will record losses and if they fall, we'll record gains. Regardless of these price movements, the initial profit we locked in at injection is never at risk. Sequent EBIT loss of $2 million during the third quarter obviously is a dramatic change in reported results from the $86 million EBIT contribution during the third quarter of 2008. So it's very consistent with these concepts. Because of the price movements I just described and their impact on reported earnings, last year we had substantial reported losses in the second quarter, which were essentially offset by substantial gains in the third quarter. This year, the effect was opposite, but with a much milder change. This year we had higher second quarter earnings followed by lower third quarter results. And let me just describe a few of the reconciling items for the year's third quarter results. First, we recognized commercial activity for the quarter was down $17 million relative to last year. That's the result of lower market volatility and milder weather during the quarter. I'll talk about future profit from gas delivery in a minute. Second, increasing gas prices during this year's third quarter resulted in a loss of $5 million on our storage hedges, compared to $105 million gain on storage hedges during the third quarter last year as prices declined significantly throughout the quarter. The last reconciling item is the low comp adjustments, we were not required to record an adjustment in this year's third quarter, but last year we recorded a $34 million adjustment. All of these items net to $10 million in operating margin for the third quarter of 2009 versus a $101 million in the third quarter of 2008. Importantly, though year-to-date Sequent is contributed EBIT of $25 million up $3 million over last year's results. As John pointed out, Sequent has been enable to take advantage of market opportunities to generate significant future economic value in its storage portfolio and you can see that in the storage rollout schedule we provide on page -- I think it's 29 in the 10-Q. In addition to the income we have already reported we have 26 million cubic feet of salt dome and reservoir storage at a weighted average in the $3.40 range, with 14 billion cubic feet schedule to be withdrawn in the first quarter of this year, I'm sorry in the fourth quarter of this year. This withdraw will generate operating margin of $23 million. We also have 10 billion cubic feet we expect to withdraw in the first quarter of 2010, which will produced operating margin of $18 million. In total, we have $45 million embedded in the current rollout schedule over the next four quarters. Obviously, market conditions could cause us to change this withdraw schedule which would impact our expected earnings results. Based on our current projection for the year-end storage positions, a $1 increase in the first quarter 2010 forward NYMEX gas prices would result in a $9 million reduction to reported operating revenue for the year. Conversely, a $1 decrease in prices would result in a $9 million positive impact. Although keep in mind that a portion of this positive impact maybe offset by low-COM adjustments in that particular scenario. Our base earnings meter exceed our internal estimates in this business, but large changes in gas price could have a significant impact on what we report at year-end, but will be made up for taking in the subsequent quarter. These movements are unrelated to when we generate the value. Turning to energy investments, we have recorded year-to-date EBIT of $7 million, which is down $11 million relative to last year. That's largely a function of $8 million in reduced margins, with $5 million of that associated with a network expansion project we completed and sold to a customer in 2008. And most of remainder is associated with lower interruptible margin opportunities at Jefferson Island. Also, expenses were up $3 million year-over-year related to legal and outside service costs for Jefferson Island and depreciation expense at Golden Triangle Storage. Year-to-date income taxes were up $6 million relative to the prior year period, mainly a function of higher consolidated earnings. Interest expense is down $10 million and that's largely a function of lower average rates this year. We continue to have good access to the commercial paper markets. We have no outstanding borrowings under our $1 billion credit facility. Our liquidity position is strong, particularly given lower working capital requirements this year resulting from lower gas prices as we have build inventories throughout the injection season. And clearly, we continue to have good access for the capital markets as evidenced by our $300 million ten- year senior note issuance in August at a very favorable rate of 5.25%. Those are the highlights, so let's go ahead and take your questions."
38,GV_001837_2010Q3,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter AGL Resources earnings conference call. My name is Ann and I’ll be your coordinator for today’s call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. (Operator instructions) We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session following the presentation. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Steve Cave, Vice President of Finance and Treasurer. Please proceed, sir. Steve Cave Thank you, Ann, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our third quarter and year-to-date earnings results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Drew Evans, Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. As you know our earnings release and Form 10-Q filing are now both available on our Web site. If you do not have copies of those you can go to our Web site and find them. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections, and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10- Q and are further detailed in our latest Form 10-K filing. We also describe our business using some non- GAAP measures such as operating margin and EBIT, and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in our earnings release. We will begin the call with some prepared remarks today before taking your questions and with that I’ll turn it over to John. John Somerhalder Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Today we reported third quarter earnings of $0.29 per diluted shares. These results were up $0.13 from our results for the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date our earnings results were $2.19 per diluted share compared with $1.97 per diluted share for the same period last year. We have reaffirmed our earnings guidance range for 2010 of $2.95 to $3.05 per share. While our results are substantially ahead of last year for the first nine months, wholesale opportunities for the fourth quarter appear smaller than in previous years, so a greater content of our earnings is coming from our utility investment. Drew will describe the components in more detail. Based on our current outlook for fourth quarter, we continue to track within the guidance range for the year. I want to highlight a couple of important accomplishments since our last earnings call before I turn it Drew for the business unit discussion. We announced last week the completion of a major milestone, our rate case in Georgia. By a four to one vote the Georgia Public Service Commission approved a $27 million rate increase for Atlanta Gas Light marking the first rate increase approved for the company since 1993. The new rates became effective on November 1. You may recall our initial filing was for $54 million and we subsequently revised that downward to $48 million to reflect more current market conditions. We believe our case clearly demonstrated the need for $48 million increase, but we do understand the Commission’s need to balance a number of factors including the current economic climate in the state and its impact on the customers. Given those external factors we believe the PSC awarded the company sufficient additional funds for our baseline operations and the additional safety and compliance work we must perform over the next year and is therefore a reasonable and constructive outcome. The decision also will allow us to offer new and improved levels of customer service to our marketers and our retail customers. I’ll briefly describe the components of the $27 million increase and Hank Linginfelter and Bryan Batson also are here to address any specific questions you might have about the case. The first component is the base revenue requirement, which represents about $11 million of the total. Our revised filing had requested $14 million for the base revenue component. The Commission recognized the need for this base revenue requirement to fund ongoing increases in costs associated with running our business, including funding for our new customer care center in Georgia. The Commission also recognized the need to provide nearly $10 million of recovery for some of the customer first initiatives that will improve customer service levels and funding to increase the number of service technicians available to reduce response times for establishing service and fulfilling other customer orders. The Commission recognized a portion of the current synergy savings; we continue to achieve resulting from our acquisition and integration of NUI Corporation in 2004 and allocated $4.4 million to the company in annual revenue over the next five years as a result. I should note that the formula used by the Commission to apportion the ongoing savings between the company and our customers results over the lifetime and about 90% of those savings from the NUI acquisition and they were into the benefit of our customers at Atlanta Gas Light. Importantly, the commission adopted a new acquisition synergy sharing policy that will apply to future transactions as well. The policy recognizes that net savings from our future acquisitions will be shared 50-50 in the benefits between shareholders and our customers and we will allow the sharing to occur for 10 years once the savings have been determined and the sharing begins. In reaching its decision, the Commission granted the company a 10.75% return on equity, which is slightly lower than our modified request of 11%, but was within our acceptable range of ROE awards presented in this case and is consistent with other recent decisions in Georgia regarding natural gas rates. The Commission authorized a 51% equity component in the capital structure as compared to the previous 48%. There are number of other provisions in the case as detailed in our press release last week, and we are certainly happy to answer any questions you may have regarding those We expect the final written order to be issued by the end of this month. And at that time, parties to the case will have 10 days to file for reconsideration of the ruling. Turning to the unregulated part of our business, we also reached the major milestone in our storage business during the third quarter, as we put the Golden Triangle Storage facility into initial commercial operation in mid September. This project is currently providing service to our anchor customer under a long-term contract for about one-third of the facilities capacity. We will continue to dewater the cavern to the end of the year in preparation for full commercial operations to begin next spring at the beginning of the annual storage injection cycle. In the meantime, we will continue to leach the second cavern at GTS, that’s going very well and we remain on track to have that cavern in commercial operations in early 2012. Placing GTS in service was a significant accomplishment for our Pivotal Storage Group as well as many others throughout the company who have worked hard over the past couple of years to construct this important facility. I will now turn it over to Drew for the financial discussion. Drew Evans Thanks, John, and good morning. I’ll cover a few of the major segment variances and then we can go to your questions. I’ll focus here mainly on the year-to-date variances compared to the prior year, with a little more detail around quarterly results for the Wholesale segment. The 10-Q we filed this morning provides the operating margin and expense reconciliations you need for the quarter by reporting segment. Our distribution business has performed very well year-to-date. EBIT for that business is up $19 million compared to the first nine months of last year. The increase is principally due to the addition of earnings from the pipeline projects we put in service last year, Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia and Magnolia project in Georgia. We have also benefited from significantly colder than normal weather in the first quarter of this year, particularly in Florida and from new rates at Elizabethtown Gas, following the rate case settlement in December of last year. Our operating expenses at the utility business increased to $7 million, but that was largely a function of expected higher payroll and benefit costs. Turning to the Retail segment, SouthStar, we continue to see strong competition for customers in the Georgia market through the use of fixed-price plans and other marketing incentives. Despite these competitive pressures, SouthStar has maintained very stable market share and continues to serve 33% of the Georgia market. SouthStar’s EBIT year-to-date was $66 million equal to last year. Operating margin was up $3 million as a result of colder weather and the resulting higher usage and increased operating margins in Ohio and Florida. These improved margins were offset somewhat by a decrease in average number of customers and pricing plan mix and lower optimization revenues. The year-over-year comparison also benefited from a $6 million lower cost or market low comp adjustment taken during the first quarter of 2009. We recorded no similar adjustment this year. Operating expenses at SouthStar were up $3 million as a result of higher legal, marketing and bad debt expenses relative to the prior period. This represents very solid and stable earnings out of the Retail segment year-over-year. In the Wholesale Services segment, we have recorded year-to-date EBIT of $38 million compared to $25 million for the prior period. As you probably recall, we entered this year with nearly $30 million of storage rollout value, which was significantly higher than our average at year end over the past five years. At the end of the second quarter this year, we still had $25 million embedded in the rollout schedule. However, year-to-date results reflect the accelerated recognition of a significant portion of that value, as we now have $6 million embedded in the rollout schedule for the remainder of this year and first and second quarters of 2011. Our Wholesale Services third quarter EBIT of $15 million, which is $17 million higher than the previous year quarter reflects $30 million in storage and transportation hedge gains resulting from declining NYMEX natural gas prices and the narrowing of transportation basis spreads throughout the quarter. In the prior year quarter, we recorded a net $9 million gain in storage and transportation hedges, a $21 million year-over-year difference. During this year’s third quarter, the increase in the hedge gains was offset by $5 million of lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments resulting from declining NYMEX prices. This pulled income down in the period but will reverse upon withdrawal. Last year, we did not record any similar adjustment in the third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have recorded $44 million of storage and transportation hedge gains as compared to a net $42 million during the prior year period. These gains are very similar year-over-year but from different sources, transportation last year and storage activity this year. We have seen an $8 million improvement in year-over-year commercial activity and operating expenses in this business have declined $7 million year-over-year, mainly as a result of a lower incentive compensation costs. As we noted in our earnings release, Sequent continues to be challenged by an environment of lower volatility as we’ve seen robust supply and diminished transportation value in the market. Those factors have constrained the economic value generation from our existing natural gas inventory and transportation portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, we had $6 million embedded in the storage rollout scheduled over the next three quarters, including $1 million in the fourth quarter this year. Obviously, our withdrawal schedules can change depending on market conditions and changes in gas prices, but it’s important to factor this lack of volatility and the acceleration of value in Sequent’s business into your views of our fourth quarter and therefore year-end results. As John said, we’re ahead of last year’s results on a year-to-date basis, but at this point still anticipate that we will be in the previously provided earnings guidance range for the year of $2.95 to $3.05. Turning to the Energy Investment segment briefly, year-to-date this business recorded $4 million of EBIT, that’s down $3 million from the prior year. The variance is largely due to the sale of AGL Networks, which was sold earlier this year. Interest expense year-to-date is up $6 million over the prior year, which primarily reflects the additional interest expense associated with the company’s $300 million bond issuance in August of last year. As you know, we’ve completed a number of significant financing transactions over the past couple of months. In September, we completed the refinancing of our $1 billion senior credit facility, which backs up our commercial paper program. The new facility expires in September of 2013. Also in October, we successfully completed the remarketing of approximately $160 million of gas revenue bonds, including the establishment of new letters of credit to provide credit enhancements for the bonds. The previous letters of credit supporting these bonds expired in June and September of this year. Those are the major drivers. So let’s turn it over to your questions."
39,GV_001837_2011Q3,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2011 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keisha, and I will be your coordinator for today’s call. As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ms. Sarah Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Keisha. Thanks to everyone for joining us this morning to review our third quarter 2011 results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and Form 10-Q filing are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Q and 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margins, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available on the appendix of our company’s presentation, as well as on our website. We’ll begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks, Sarah and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3 of our company presentation, you can see that we reported third quarter 2011 earnings loss of $0.04 per diluted share, excluding $5 million of cost incurred during the quarter related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $0.02. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely reflective of a significant negative variance in our wholesale services segment related to lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility of takeaway capacity constraints in the Marcellus shale production region. However we continue to see strong performance in our utility business resulting from a combination of reasonable rate case outcomes and infrastructure investments we’ve made to maintain and enhance the safety and reliability of our system. For the first nine months of the year, we reported diluted GAAP EPS of $1.78 or $1.98, including Nicor- related expenses, $0.21 lower than the first 9 months of 2010. In the press release we issued on October 17th, we reduced our 2011 EPS guidance to $2.90 to $3 per share. This is down from our original guidance of $3.10 to $3.20 per share and is due primarily to the degradation of earnings at Sequent. You can see the guidance range in our long term EPS and dividend track record on Slide 4 of the presentation. Moving onto Slide 5, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our results across the business looking back to 2006. And underneath that chart is a quarterly look at EBIT, which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of our business. You’ll note that our wholesale and retail businesses, which are more weather dependent tend to have muted earnings in the second and third quarters of the year, and that we're heading into our seasonally stronger quarters when we benefit from higher heating demand. On the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 81% of the total positive EBIT contributions in the first 9 months of 2011. Retail accounted for 18%, energy investments for 1%. And you’ll notice the absence of positive EBIT contribution from Sequent year-to-date due to the issue that I just mentioned. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. Primarily as a result of rate decisions and infrastructure programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas, EBIT was up $15million or 27% compared to last year. New rates for Atlanta Gas Light were effective in the fourth quarter of 2010, and we have infrastructure improvement riders in place in both Georgia and New Jersey. The combination of these 2 factors drove the $10 million of operating margin improvement year-over-year. Operating expenses in the distribution segment decreased by 2% driven mainly by lower incentive compensation accruals. Excluding this issue, operating expenses were up $6 million or 5% due to increased depreciation for more assets in service, higher legal expenses and higher payroll and benefit cost. You can see that our average customer count for the third quarter was up just slightly from this time last year and remains stable. Year-to-date, our distribution business reported EBIT of $287 million, up 10% versus last year. The same major drivers we saw in the quarter also are the factors driving good performance for the first 9 months of the year, and these results put our utility business on track to have a very strong year in 2011. Turning to the retail segment. SouthStar on Slide 7. We recorded an EBIT loss at $5 million for the third quarter of 2011, up $4 million improvement over our $9 million EBIT loss for last year’s third quarter. Due to reduced transportation and gas cost, we experienced increased margins, but that was partially offset by the continued competitive environment in Georgia, including lower retail price spreads. SouthStar’s market share in Georgia is 32%, relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. Year-to-date, EBIT at SouthStar is down 3% compared to 2010 due mainly to warmer weather in the first 9 months of 2011 versus 2010 and the migration of customers to lower margin price plans. You’ll find third quarter 2011 results for our wholesale service segment on Slide 8. John will provide additional detail on the circumstances surrounding the losses in the quarter, so for now, I’ll focus on the financial results in the business. As expected, Sequent continues to face the challenges in lower market volatility and lower price differentials for storage and transportation. This is reflected in our EBIT loss of $37 million, a decline of $52 million compared to third quarter 2010. The largest component of EBIT decline came from a $35 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year, giving you a breakdown of commercial activity during the quarter. $18 million of the year-over- year decline was related to general poor wholesale market conditions, including low price volatility for natural gas and tight transportation storage spread. Transportation spreads between the Gulf Coast and northeast essentially collapsed for much of the summer, significantly hampering our ability to earn margins on gas transportation. Further price differentials between the summer to winter seasons have been driven down in the past few years. We do not see near-term catalyst that will change these dynamics, and we’re working to adapt our business to better weather the circumstances. We also recognized losses of $15 million related to transportation constraints in the Marcellus Shale region. In addition, we took a charge of $2 million related to a customer bankruptcy during the third quarter. We took a similar charge -- we took a charge for a similar amount in the second quarter and any remaining credit exposure associated with this customer is now fully behind us. Looking at other factors aside from commercial activity that impacted us during the quarter. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, during the third quarter of 2010, we had unusually large storage and transportation hedge gains of $30 million. This compares to $14 million of gains in the third quarter of 2011 translating into a $16 million accounting loss year-over-year. We also recorded lower of cost or market, known as LOCOM, during the quarter of $9 million compared to $5 million last year resulting in another accounting loss of $4 million more than last year. Looking briefly at expenses for the quarter, they were down $4 million compared to last year, due mainly to a reduction in annual incentive accruals. Year-to-date wholesale services posted an EBIT loss of $9 million, a $47 million decrease over the first 9 months of 2010. Operating margin was lower by $47 million largely driven by the same issues affecting the third quarter with $30 million of the decrease coming from lower hedge gains, higher LOCOM and the remainder due to a transportation constraint in customer credit losses. Looking to our current storage rollout schedule at the end of the third quarter, Sequent has $6 million of economic value, which is equivalent to last year at the same time. From our vantage point today, we expect positive EBIT for this segment in the fourth quarter. Moving onto Slide 9, you can see that our energy investments segment had slight improvement during the quarter as compared to last year. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. The main thing I want to point out here is that we have effectively completed the financing for cash consideration of the Nicor transaction. Interest expense for the transaction is better than our expectation but we prefunded our requirements to reduce our exposure to interest rates. Because of this, interest expense was up $4 million for the third quarter and $11 million for the first 9 months of last year -- versus last year. As a reminder, our full year 2011 guidance is now $2.90 to $3 per share, excluding Nicor-related merger cost. We anticipate providing combined company guidance when we file our 10-K next year and host our fourth quarter and year end earnings calls. Thanks for your time today, and now I’ll turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Drew, and good morning. I want to provide some additional context to the information that Drew just reviewed with you related to our wholesale services results during the quarter. The fundamentals of the natural gas wholesale business continue to face extreme pressure. In most geographic locations in the U.S., the wholesale natural gas industry and Sequent are experiencing continued declining values for pipeline transportation and storage. This fundamental weakening of transportation and storage asset values in the third quarter has been caused by 2 major factors: third quarter weather dynamics and continued increases in natural gas production. Starting with third quarter weather, you can see on Slide 11 that while there was warmer than usual weather in parts of the country in July and August, the primary areas served by Sequent, the northeast and the midwest experienced cooler temperatures and reduced gas-fired power supply relative to 2010. However, Texas and the mid-continent experienced record setting temperatures. As a result of this disparity between the Texas region and the northeast, natural gas prices in the producing regions in the Gulf and mid-continent increased, while prices in the midwest and northeast decreased, resulting in a negative impact on pipeline transportation values. Unlike weather which is transitory, we continue to see significant increases in shale gas production. U.S. total gas production grew to over 63 billion cubic foot per day in the third quarter with production increasing by almost 5 Bcf per day in the past year, much of this due to the shale gas. Shale production increases are focused in the northeast market areas, particularly in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania. Excess gas supply in this region caused severe compression of the price spread differential from the Gulf Coast to the northeast and significantly eroded third quarter pipeline optimization values. Such large increases in production, coupled with a growing supply of storage capacity, have also had a negative impact on storage optimization values. On Slide 12, you can see that price differentials between summer to winter seasons have been driven down by approximately 50% in the past few years. Sequent has about 30 Bcf of storage that is impacted by the change in price spreads over the summer to winter seasons. So a 50% decline in spreads can obviously have a meaningful impact on our business. Shifting now to the Marcellus constraint issue that we experienced during the third quarter, over the last 2 years, Sequent executed forward purchases of gas supply in the Marcellus. By purchasing gas supply in Pennsylvania and closer to our asset management customer, city gates, our view is that Sequent would save money on transportation charges as it is less expensive to transport gas supply from Pennsylvania to the customers than from Texas and Louisiana to those customers. In securing this forward gas supply, Sequent was relying on historical pipeline operations that would allow such gas supply purchases to flow on a secondary basis on the pipeline. These volumes flowed reliably using secondary transportation service until late July at which time Sequent started experiencing curtailments of a portion of secondary transportation due to extreme supply growth in the region. Curtailments increased as the third quarter progressed. And by September, the vast majority of secondary flow was curtailed. Sequent and others relying on this historical secondary flow were unable to transport Marcellus gas to market and were forced to either secure higher price transportation capacity or sell out volumes at lower market prices. As a result of this issue, Sequent experienced losses of $15 million during the third quarter, and that includes $7 million associated with renegotiation -- we’re renegotiating certain of its producer agreements. We expect additional losses in the fourth quarter of this year. And based on preliminary results, we expect the impact in the month of October to be approximately $2 million. Importantly, we now have balanced our position with transportation capacity that came online November 1st and expect the impact to further diminish in magnitude going forward. So what does this all mean for 2012 and beyond? We do expect the low volatility and low spread environment to persist. And we are continuing to modify Sequent’s portfolio accordingly. For example, we are analyzing the fixed cost in the business, reevaluating the types of contracts we pursued going forward and repositioning the company to be successful in a potentially prolonged period of reduced volatility. Assuming that we stay in this low volatility environment for 2012, we may be looking at EBIT for the wholesale segment that is half or potentially a little less than half of our original EBIT projection of $53 million for the business in 2011. There are some possible upside scenarios, and we will be well positioned if volatility returns to the market sooner than we expect. However at this time, we are providing a view that is consistent with the current challenging market conditions in that business. Moving on to our distribution segment. I’ll just reiterate what Drew said in that we are having a very solid year. Our rate cases last year and ongoing infrastructure investment programs are providing support, and we have maintained our track record of controlling costs in that business. Our customer count has remained stable throughout the course of the year and was even up a little in the third quarter. At this point, we expect to be well ahead of our 2011 EBIT guidance of $374 million for the distribution segment by the time we close out the year. The only rate case activity on our agenda currently is for Virginia Natural Gas. We filed our rate case in February of this year and consistent with regulations in Virginia, we put rates into effect on October 1st, subject to refund. Written testimony has been filed and a hearing is scheduled for this Friday. As a reminder, rate cases typically take 12 to 18 months to prosecute in Virginia. SouthStar is having another good year and is on track to meet full year EBIT in line with our guidance of $97 million. They’ve done a good job managing that business in a very competitive Georgia environment and successfully maintaining a leading market share position. And similar to our distribution business, Mike and his team have effectively controlled their costs. In our storage business, we are still reaching Cavern 2 at Golden Triangle and expect that, that facility will come on line late in the first quarter of 2012. We initially planned for the facility to have 6 Bcf of working gas capacity. But we’ve extended leaching period, and we think we’ll be a little closer to 7 Bcf by the time we begin commercial operation. We also continue to make permitting progress for expansions at Jefferson Island. Before we conclude today’s call, I want to give you a quick update on the Nicor merger approval process, which is outlined on Slide 13. With the exception of Illinois Commerce Commission, we have secured all major approvals we need to close the Nicor transaction. At the end of September, we received a proposed order from the administrative law judge hearing the case in Illinois. He accepted all of the issues we previously settled with the staff and ruled in a balanced way on the outstanding issues allowing us to move forward. We have been placed on today’s Illinois Commerce Commission agenda for discussion and a possible vote. However, the statutory deadline for decision remains December 16. If we receive approval from the commission, we will be prepared to close within 7 to 10 days. Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, though we experienced challenges in our wholesales services business during the third quarter, our distribution business performed particularly well. SouthStar is on track for another good year, and we continue to make progress on our storage assets. 2012 will be a transformational year for us as we integrate Nicor’s businesses and welcome their employees and shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter as we wrap up the year and provide our outlook for the combined company. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we would like to thank each of you for your continued interest and support of our company. Operator, I’ll now turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
40,GV_001837_2012Q3,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2012 AGL Resources, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Darcel, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Sarah Stashak. Please proceed. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Darcel. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning to review our third quarter 2012 results. Joining me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-Q for AGL Resources and Nicor Gas are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-Q, and more fully described in our most recent 10-K filings. We often describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. Reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our presentation as well as on our website. We will begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I will turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Welcome back, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3 of our presentation, we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of $0.08. On an adjusted basis, excluding $2 million of merger related costs, diluted earnings per share were $0.09, which compares to $0.02 in the third quarter of 2011. The primary year-over-year driver of our third quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses, the results of which are not reflected in the third quarter of 2011 GAAP comparisons. Our quarterly results reflect an $0.08 per share negative impact due to $16 million of pre-tax mark-to-market hedge losses in our Wholesale Services segment consistent with the press release we issued on October 11. Excluding that impact which is temporal, our business performed well during the quarter. Turning briefly to Slide 4, you can see that our year-to-date financial results through the first 3 quarters. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $1.56, down from $1.99 for the same period last year. The primary reason for the decline is the impact of the unprecedented warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year as well as mark-to-market storage hedge losses. On Slide 5, you can see that more than 80% of our consolidated positive operating EBIT for the first 9 months of 2012 was generated by our distribution operations segment. Retail operations accounted for 17% year-to-date and midstream operations, 1%. Wholesale Services and cargo shipping are not represented here, as they reported EBIT losses through the first 9 months. I will cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on Slide 6. EBIT was up $10 million, compared to the third quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $15 million from Nicor Gas. As I mentioned last quarter we are starting to see the benefits of our shared service model accrue across our entire business and one of the key metrics that we use to gauge this is O&M expense per utility customer. O&M per customer was a $102, down from $109 per customer for the same period in 2011. For the first 9 months of 2012, EBIT at the legacy AGL Resources Utilities was up $7 million year-over- year primarily due to our continued focus on effective expense management and higher contribution for regulatory infrastructure programs. In addition, we have largely achieved expected cost savings related to integrating our non-utility business. Turning to the retail segment on Slide 7. We recorded EBIT for the third quarter of $5 million, a $10 million increase compared to the third quarter last year. The increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail businesses to our portfolio as well as a reduction in transportation and gas cost and lower bad debt expense at Southstar relative to last year. You will find third quarter 2012 results for our wholesale services segment on Slide 8. There are a few moving pieces affecting our year-over-year results, so let me take you through them now. In total, EBIT improved by $14 million year-over-year for the third quarter. You will recall that in the last year’s third quarter we recorded margin losses of $17 million due to transportation constraints in the Marcellus region as well as the impact of a credit default due to a customer bankruptcy. We also recorded a lower cost of market adjustment for LOCOM of $9 million during the third quarter of 2011, and storage hedge gains of $14 million. In the third quarter of this year, are Marcellus customer bankruptcy and the LOCOM factors were absent. However, we recorded storage hedge losses of $15 million due to rising natural gas prices. This is the primary driver of our EBIT loss for the quarter. John will talk in greater detail about these items in just a few minutes. But it’s important to keep in mind that Sequent has generated higher economic value during the quarter and throughout the year. As a result we have a storage rollout scheduled of $65 million and we expect to realize that value in operating revenue during the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. This is an improvement of $18 million over the rollout schedule that we discussed at the end of the second quarter of 2012 and a $9 million improvement as compared to last year. Now let’s move to Slide 9. EBIT at our mid-stream segment was $1 million during the third quarter of 2012, down $1 million compared to the prior year. The decline is due primarily to lower revenue at Jefferson Island versus the prior year due to re-contracting at lower rates. You can see the blended rates for each storage facility on the chart at the bottom right side of the page. Overall, the market for storage remains weak but we continue to focus on ways to optimize the value of our available capacity while not committing the long-term contracts in this low price environment. Briefly, the cargo shipping segment reported an EBIT loss of $1 million during the third quarter of 2012. Factors impacting this business have remained consistent throughout the year. Revenue per unit is down but shipments are up, relative to the same period last year. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our long-term debt was at $3.3 billion, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction, and additional Nicor debt we’ll assume in closing the transaction. Interest expense was up $14 million for the quarter compared to the same period in 2011, mainly driven by the higher debt levels. We are trending favorably to expectation year-to-date by approximately $5 million due to the timing of some long-term financing activity and higher capitalized interest related to the timing of placing our storage assets into commercial service this year. Turning to our capital expenditures. We now expect our spending to be down about $30 million relative to our earlier projections. This reduction is due primarily to the timing of infrastructure investment spending in Virginia and Georgia and we do expect those investments to be made in future periods. In addition, capital spending for some of our non-regulated efforts have come down, which also is partly a timing issue. Finally, as a reminder, we provided an updated earnings per share guidance range in mid-October to reflect the warmer than normal weather in the first half of the year and the mark-to-market impacts on our wholesale services business in the third quarter. Our new guidance range is $2.60 to $2.75 per share. Fourth quarter is typically one of our strongest quarters due to weather and customer usage patterns as well as the potential for higher natural gas price volatility. However, because these factors are difficult to predict with a higher degree of certainty, let me remind you that we do have potential for variability in our fourth quarter earnings. Thanks for your time today. And now, I will turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thanks, Drew, and good morning. Turning to Slide 11. I will just recap the 2 major factors influencing our year-to-date earnings. First, as we discussed last quarter, you can see the weather anomalies that have affected our utilities at our Georgia retail business year-to-date. Second, Pete and the Sequent team have done an excellent job of creating economic value around our storage positions but this economic value largely remains in our storage rollout schedule and therefore has not yet shown up in our reported results in the wholesale segment. The economic value of the storage rollout schedule is $65 million as of the end of the quarter, well above the $6 million storage rollout value at this time last year, and also well above the historical average storage rollout value at the end of the third quarter. In addition, the chart on the bottom left shows the increasing natural gas prices which have impacted our reported results in the wholesale segment. The mark-to-market losses associated with the increasing natural gas price, helped improve the rollout schedule in the quarter up to the $65 million, but resulted in a negative $15 million EBIT impact to Sequent for the quarter. In our 10-Q filing, we provided more detail on our sensitivity to natural gas prices. And based on the current projection of year end storage positions of 33 BCF, a $1 increase in the 2013 forward NYMEX price could result in the $31 million reduction to wholesale services’ reported operating revenues for 2012, but would increase the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013 by a corresponding amount. A $1 decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in the $31 million positive impact. However, additional low-comp adjustment could potentially offset a portion of that positive impact. Excluding additional low- comp adjustments, the dollar decrease in forward NYMEX prices would result in a corresponding decrease in the expected operating revenues to be realized in 2013. Moving to Slide 12. You can see our historical storage rollout schedule. This is the second strongest rollout schedule in Sequent’s history. Based on our current schedule, we expect to realize approximately $28 million of economic value for gross margins in the fourth quarter of this year with the remainder to be realized in 2013. Importantly, we remain focused on managing controllable expenses and we have made significant progress towards achieving our efficiency initiatives related to the Nicor merger. We are earning close to our allowed rates of return at each utility and we have managed our non-regulated businesses in a way that optimizes their value despite challenging market fundamentals. We thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources. Operator, I will go ahead now and turn the call back over to you to start the Q&A session."
41,GV_001837_2013Q3,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tehisha [ph], and I will be your coordinator for today's call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ms. Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Good morning. Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today to review our third quarter 2013 results. Joining me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-Q are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-Q filing. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as EBIT, operating margin, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and EPS excluding our wholesale services segment. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our presentation, as well as on our website. We'll begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I'll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. I will begin today with a recap of our financial results for the quarter and year-to-date, and then I'll turn it over to John for some additional remarks. Our solid third quarter results are additive to our very strong performance year-to-date. We continue to track ahead of expectations in nearly all segments, and as a result, we're raising our full year 2013 earnings per diluted share outlook to between $2.75 and $2.85 on a consolidated basis. Guidance excluding wholesale services has risen to between $2.55 and $2.65. John will provide more information on our upward revision in a few minutes. Looking specifically at the quarter, starting on Slide 3, we reported third quarter 2013 earnings of $0.24 per diluted share, an increase of $0.15 compared to the third quarter of last year, excluding the Nicor merger expenses. The principal variance in the quarter relates to strong commercial activity in our wholesale services segment despite being muted by hedge losses. Excluding wholesale services, EPS was $0.24 for the quarter, compared to $0.21 last year, due to year- over-year improvements at distribution operations, retail operations and cargo shipping. In addition to achieving strong financial results, we received approvals on several important regulatory and legislative initiatives during the quarter, which John will speak to in greater detail. On Slide 4, you will see our year-to-date results through September. Diluted EPS was $1.96, an increase of $0.40 from last year, excluding the Nicor merger expenses. Excluding wholesale services, EPS was $1.85 for the first 9 months, up $0.22 year-over-year. The variance year-over-year through September is mainly due to: colder weather and usage compared to the same periods that were historically warm last year in distribution and retail; higher revenues from regulatory infrastructure programs; higher commercial activity in the wholesale services segment; and the gain on the sale of Compass, offset by higher compensation expense accruals related to above-target performance for the full year. Through the first 9 months, our distribution segment contributed 78% of operating EBIT and our retail businesses contributed 17%. Taking a closer look at each segment, a snapshot of third quarter EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 5. EBIT was up $6 million compared to the third quarter of 2012. This is mainly due to increased margin from our infrastructure replacement programs and increased customer growth and usage. Through the first 9 months, the main drivers of the $39 million year-over-year EBIT improvement were slightly- colder-than-normal weather during the first quarter that was 34% colder than the record warm weather we experienced in the first quarter of 2012; and higher revenues from our infrastructure investment programs. You'll notice that O&M expense is up 4% year-to-date, this is due largely to increased accruals for incentive compensation related to performance above targeted levels. Excluding this factor, our expense control has been excellent this year, which is consistent with our shared services model. With regard to customer growth, we have had a modest increase in our total utility customer account this year as compared to 2012. Before leaving this slide, I also want to remind you of the weather hedge that we have in place related to Nicor Gas for the fourth quarter. It is designed largely to mitigate our downside weather risk in Illinois in the event of significantly warmer-than-normal weather, while retaining upside potential should the fourth quarter be colder than normal. This affords additional protection for our shareholders, and we will continue to evaluate options for mitigating our Illinois-weather risk in future periods. Turning to the retail segment on Slide 6. We reported EBIT for the third quarter of $8 million, an increase of $3 million compared to the third quarter of 2012. For the first 9 months of the year, EBIT for the segment increased $11 million year-over-year. The primary driver of the third quarter improvement is the acquisition of 500,000 retail service contracts in January for this year. For the year through September, the increase is a result of colder-than-normal weather in the first half of the year, as well as the acquisition of the retail services customers. In Georgia, we retained our leading market share position in our retail services business. The number of warranty contracts we are serving is up substantially year-over-year due to the acquisition I just mentioned. At the end of the second quarter of this year, we completed the acquisition of approximately 33,000 residential commercial customer relationships in Illinois. Integration of that acquisition went as planned and is largely complete. You'll find third quarter 2013 results for our wholesale services segment on Slide 7. The EBIT loss of $2 million for the quarter is an improvement from the $23 million loss in the third quarter of 2012. The $21 million improvement is driven by strong commercial activity, offset by net hedge losses. Through September, EBIT at the wholesale segment has improved by $37 million year-over-year, primarily driven by commercial activity that is $62 million, offset by net hedge losses in 2013 versus net hedge gains in 2012 and the $11 million gain on the sale of Compass in the second quarter of 2013. Through September, we recorded net hedge losses of $27 million, compared to net hedge gains of $8 million for the same period in 2012. The substantial improvement in commercial activity is related to improved monetization of our diverse asset portfolio. The storage rollout schedule at the end of September was $23 million, compared to $65 million at the end of the same period in 2012. The $42 million year-over-year reduction is reflective of the monetization of many of our storage positions as we withdrew natural gas from storage in the first half of this year. Now let's move to Slide 8. The midstream segment decline year-over-year is due largely to the roll off of legacy contracts that were above current market rates, as well as higher depreciation, property tax and other storage-related expenses due to the additional facilities in service when compared to last year. Market fundamentals continue to be challenging for this business segment due to low natural gas price volatility, abundant market supplies and associated low seasonal storage spreads. As a result, we have entered into shorter-term contracts at lower rates, reflective of the current market, and in some cases have further optimized the value of the assets through short-duration transactions. Briefly, you can see the results for the cargo shipping segment on Slide 9. Third quarter results were $3 million higher than in the prior year's third quarter, and through September, the segment is up about $4 million compared to last year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is when substantially all of this segments' operating income is anticipated due to the seasonal nature of the business. We are seeing continued improvement in market conditions, and our volume is higher by 10% year-over-year through September. While the rate per 20-foot equivalent unit, or TEU, has fallen slightly on average due to pricing action taken last summer, rates for the third quarter were above last year's levels. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. Our debt-to-capitalization improved modestly for the -- from quarter-to-quarter and stands at 55% at the end of September. We noted in our 10-Q that  we have exercised an option under our 2 existing credit facilities to extend their duration by an additional year. We are awaiting lender approval on the request, but we do not anticipate any problems in extending the maturities. When approved, both facilities would mature at the end of 2017. Interest expense was down by $2 million for both the quarter and the year compared to the same periods in 2012. 2013 interest expense reflects a $4 million reduction due to a third quarter correction of interest expense amortization related to prior periods. Through September, we remain on track for a very strong year. Importantly, we were driving improvements in nearly every business segment through a combination of margin growth and ongoing expense discipline. As we enter the fourth quarter and the winter heating season, we are well-positioned to exceed the objectives we set forth at the beginning of the year. Thanks for your time today. Now, I'll turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thanks, Drew, and good morning, everyone. I would like to spend a few minutes this morning discussing some of the strategic steps we have taken that have led to the year-over-year improvements Drew described and ultimately drove our decision to raise our guidance for this year. Clearly, as Drew pointed out, we have benefited from slightly-colder-than-normal weather this year, which is one significant driver of our year-over-year margin improvements. However, there are several strategic initiatives we have undertaken this year that have resulted in strong performance and we want to highlight these for you in a bit more detail. In our distribution business, our infrastructure investment programs have resulted in enhanced safety and pipeline integrity for our customers while generating additional revenues for our shareholders. In addition, our non-payroll expense discipline is among the best in our sector due to our shared services model and our ability to generate efficiencies while spreading costs over a larger customer base. Further our regulatory and legislative affairs teams have worked hard to obtain approvals for key programs across our footprint, specifically in Illinois, Georgia and New Jersey. Our strategic initiatives related to our non-utility businesses also are bearing fruit. We made some targeted acquisitions in our retail business earlier this year, both of which are already generating enhanced returns. In our wholesale services business, we scaled back our cost structure to withstand a low-volatility environment and our team in Houston has done a remarkable job of retaining customers, bringing in new business and positioning our storage and transportation portfolios to take advantage of market dislocations that are occurring as a result of a shale gas revolution. And our cargo shipping business volumes have improved meaningfully year-over-year due to improving market fundamentals and a highly focused management team. As Drew described, we are raising full year 2013 earnings per diluted share outlook to between $2.75 and $2.85 on a consolidated basis, up from $2.50 to $2.70. Guidance excluding wholesale services has risen to between $2.55 and $2.65, up from $2.40 to $2.50. The increase in our guidance range reflects very good success on many of the initiatives I just mentioned, which position us well for a strong finish to this year and for growth over the next few years. Let me summarize the main EPS drivers of the increase, which you will find on Slide 11. Slightly-colder- than-normal weather across our distribution and retail businesses through June resulted in favorability to expectations of $0.05. As mentioned, last week we received approval to lower our depreciation rate in Illinois by approximately 100 basis points, which will reduce depreciation expense for the remainder of the year by $17 million or $0.08 per share, which will be recognized in the fourth quarter. We announced earlier this year that we recorded a $0.04 gain on the sale of Compass during the second quarter. In addition, the acquisition at the end of the second quarter of additional retail customers in Illinois is expected to add about $0.02 this year, and lower interest expense versus expectations should add $0.04. Importantly, underlying all of this is, is our ongoing focus on controlling expenses, which has resulted in additional favorability to our initial forecast. As a partial offset to these increases, we expect that variable compensation expense will increase relative to our original expectation, due to our strong year- to-date performance and expectations for the fourth quarter. And I'll just remind you that mark-to-market accounting related to storage and transportation hedge movements can have a meaningful impact on our wholesale business and our consolidated results. For that reason, and consistent with our past practices, our consolidated EPS guidance excludes the impact of any mark-to-market accounting movements. Before I take your questions, I will briefly highlight some legislative and regulatory developments during the quarter, starting on Slide 12. We filed a depreciation study on behalf of Nicor Gas with Illinois Commerce Commission on August 30, recommending a revised composite depreciation rate of 3.07%, compared to the long-standing rate of 4.1%. The ICC approved the new rate on October 23 and it is effective as of August 30. As I noted earlier, this is expected to result in lower depreciation expense of $17 million this year and $50 million on an annualized basis. Importantly, this change does not impact the rates Nicor customers pay for service and it provides good incentives for Nicor Gas to increase its capital expenditures. Also during the second quarter, Illinois Governor Quinn signed legislation that provides for infrastructure investment program for Illinois gas utilities, including Nicor Gas. A related rule making it is now before the ICC, and we are actively involved in that process. As a reminder, because Nicor Gas is under a base- rate freeze until December 2014 as part of the AGL-Nicor merger agreement, any new rates under this program could not take effect until January 2015. Turning to Georgia and New Jersey on Slide 13, in Georgia, we received approval of our request to replace approximately 750 miles of vintage plastic pipeline over a 4-year period. This phase of the program is expected to cost approximately $275 million. As a continuation of our STRIDE program, we filed a new $260 million program in August that would be applied to system reinforcement and customer growth projects, carrying our schedule in November with the ruling anticipated in December of 2013. And in New Jersey, we received approval of our request for infrastructure investment under the AIR program. Under this program, we expect to spend $115 million over 4 years. In conjunction with this approval, we agreed to file a general rate case for Elizabethtown Gas by September 2016. Again we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date and we are well-positioned for a strong finish to the year. Employees across our organization have worked diligently throughout the year, as they always do, to help us exceed our objectives thus far. As a management team, we cannot express enough appreciation for their efforts. And we thank our shareholders for your continued interest in and support of AGL. Operator, I'll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
42,GV_001837_2007Q4,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the AGL Resources Fourth Quarter and year-end 2007 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michelle and I will be your audio coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Steve Cave, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. Steve Cave Okay, thank you Michelle, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our year- end 2007 earnings results. On the call today presenting prepared remarks we have John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO, Andrew Evans our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; other members of our Executive Management Team are here, today to assist with any questions you may have. We issued our earnings release and filed our Form 10-K this morning, copies of those documents are available on our website along with a slide presentation that provides a little more detail on our earnings results. Before we began let me take a moment to just remind you that some of the things we will discuss today concern future company performance and include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Laws. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements and you should refer to the additional information contained in the Form 10-K we filed this morning as well as our SEC filings concerning factors that could cause those material differences. In addition today's discussion does include certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC Regulation G. A reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available on our website. And with that I'll turn the call over to John. John W. Somerhalder II Thanks Steve, Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. We will spend most of our time this morning reviewing the full and year, but certainly can answer any questions you may have specifically about the fourth quarter. As you know we reported $2.74 per basic share for 2007, a slight increase over the $2.73 per basic share we reported in 2006. Drew will cover the financial details, but I want to make few comments about our results for the year and where we are headed for 2008. First, let me start out by saying that we as a management team take very seriously, our accountability for the company's results and acknowledge that our 2007 results will be below the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.01 per share. The major driver for the year was the lower results in our wholesale business. In 2007, we saw low volatility in the natural gas markets and that wallet as you all know about an 18- month period for late 2005 through 2006 of high volatility and high summer-winter spreads in those markets. Throughout 2007, we strongly focused on improving the performance of all of our businesses. The strong results we had in other business segments in 2007 offset to a large extent to lower results in our wholesale business. We continue to strengthen the fundamentals of our utility business during the year and that focus resulted in our distribution business having a good year relative to 2006. We saw steady customer growth in our three largest franchise, Atlantic Gas Light, Elizabethtown and Virginia Natural Gas. We achieved significant reductions in customer attrition levels but economic conditions especially during the last half of the year limited new growth. The net result was that we still had average customer growth for the year as compared to the prior year of about 0.9% and that was just slightly below our target that was in the range of about 1.25%. Importantly this top line growth was complemented by a continuing strong focus on cost management and our utilities. As you can see from looking at a couple of our key methods for the year, our EBIT per customer improved to $149 in 2007 from $138 in 2006, an 8% increase. Our O&M expenses per customer declined to $145 in 2007 as compared to $156 in 2006. The largest factor in the decline was incentive compensation, however other areas across reduction contributed to this improved result as well. We also had several successes on regulatory fronts, and I want to touch on these again because our regulatory strategy is a key part of the long-term success and earnings predictability of our utilities. The first is an ongoing collaborative effort between our utilities and sequent to focus on the renewal of some of our key asset management agreements. We received approval from George Public Service Commission to extend our largest asset manager agreement through March 2012, and we are actively working and have made significant progress with the other state commissions to renew or amend the existing agreements we have or that are set to expire in 2008. We also... also we're successful in gaining approval in Virginia for WNA rider for commercial customers that applies to 2007 and 2008 heating seasons and helps stabilized rates for those customers. And as we talked about earlier in Florida we received approval from the Florida Commission in December to include the amortization of certain components of the purchase price we paid for Florida City gas and our returns on equity calculations for regulatory reporting purposes and that approval also included provisions for a five-year rates. Turning to the Retail Energy Operations segment. SouthStar performed very well in 2007, in addition to growing its customer base in Georgia SouthStar took significant steps during the year to expand its competitive presence in other states that are deregulating their retail natural gas markets such as Ohio and Florida. They will continue to focus on strengthening their presence in those markets and evaluating entry into others throughout 2008. Despite the market conditions of 2007, Sequent made several strategic moves during the year that have strengthened our presence in the market and has positioned us well for the future. Sequent continue to expand its asset management and marketing presence throughout the Western and Northwestern parts of the country as well as into Canada. We also strengthened our ability to better serve commercial and industrial customers through the acquisition of Compass Energy which provides a platform for us to build our capabilities in that segment of the market. In the energy investment segment, our existing storage facility Jefferson Island had a very successful year. In addition to generating additional operating margin through optimizing interruptible capacity. The facility had a number of operating successes as well, including the perfect safety record and no service interruptions throughout the year. Also our AGL Networks business, while clearly a smaller part of our business also had a strong year of operating results and signed several significant contracts during the year that enhance the ongoing revenue stream, from that business. During the year, we move forward three capital investment growth projects, that will add significant long term value to our company. First our Texas storage investment Golden Triangle Storage, continues to move forward as planned. We received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on December 31, to move ahead with this project, and we accepted the certificate in January. We now are securing some of the other necessary state and local approvals, and we expect that we will began construction in April or May timeframe of this year. The open season for storage services we held in 2007 illustrates the strong demand for this project and we will keep you up-to-date on our progress as we head into the construction phase. Clearly we believe the fundamental value of storage, and the role it will play over the next decade in the linear [ph] energy demands are strong. We also have began work on our Hampton Roads Crossing project in Virginia which will connect the north and south sections of our service territory there and enhance our to natural gas supply for that region. We expect that project to be completed on schedule by late 2009. We also announced that as part of the Georgia Public Service Commission's approval of the capacity supply plan last year, we will diversify our supply source in Georgia and that will be by gaining additional access to LNG from Elba Island. We signed an agreement with Southern Natural Gas to obtain an undivided interest in pipelines connecting our system to Elba and we have filed for FERC approval of the project which we anticipate will achieve that some time in 2008. The key takeaway is that we have been working on many initiatives throughout 2007 that we believe position us very well to meet or exceed expectations in 2008 and beyond. With that let me turn to 2008 and what we expect. In our earnings release we initiated our fiscal year 2008 earnings guidance of $2.75 to $2.85 per share. This range assumes normal weather somewhat lower growth expectations associated with the economic slowdown and I talked about how that impacted growth in our Utilities a minute ago. Normalized earnings level from SouthStar and some additional business development expenses associated with our capital investment and storage projects. I think it is important to keep in mind that we manage the business with a long term view and consistent with that there may be times when the earnings growth may not exactly be even distributed from one year to the next. That has been the case for the past two years with the more normal Sequent in 2007 which follow two years of higher earnings in that segment as well as the additional commitment of development dollars for our growth projects. I also want to point out that yesterday the Board of Directors approved a $0.4 per share increase in our annual dividend from $1.64 per share to $1.68 per share. We have now increased our dividend in each of the past five years and have brought our dividend payout ratio very close to the peer group average which is now on the low 60% range. With that I will turn it over to Drew for a discussion of the financial results. Drew. Andrew W. Evans Thanks John and good morning everybody. I will run through the segments for you quickly and then we can go to your questions. As John said our comments here are focused on full year results and not fourth quarter. Its important for us to maintain our long term focus on the business and annual earnings gives us... I think a complete picture is consistent with the way we provide guidance. Our distribution operations business continues to perform well in the challenging environment with a $30 million increase in operating margin. We invested in some additional marketing initiatives in 2007 as a way to reduce our attrition rate and attract new customers. As a result we added an additional 21,000 customers during the year which was the key driver of the segments increasing operating margin as compared to 2006. About $2 million of the increase was from higher pipeline replacement revenue in Georgia and another $2 million resulted from higher base rates at Chattanooga Gas following a rate case in 2006. As rates went in to effect on January 1, 2007. Operating expenses were down $14 million in distribution operations mainly due to lower incentive compensation related to earnings results below our internal expectation. We had increased depreciation and amortization cost of about $6 million, but those were largely offset by $6 million net decreases and expenses from lower pension outside service, customer service expenses during the year. Coupling both margin and expense we saw $28 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes for the distribution business. Turning to retail operations, our SouthStar business had a very strong performance for the year with a $32 million increase in operating margin relative to the property the prior year. The margin increase was due to several factors so I'll breakdown the major components for you. We had an $8 million increase in average customer usage in Georgia as some of the conservation trends we saw in 2006 were largely reversed in 2007. We had $3 million increase as a result of SouthStar's entry into the Ohio market and additional $2 million came from adding 7,000 customers in the Georgia market, about a 1.3% customer growth rate, and an additional $2 million resulted from late payment fees in part due to fewer customers being on payment arrangement plans in 2007 as compared to 2006. In this instance, late fees were suspended as part of the plans for customers who are working through the higher bills of 2006. SouthStar's retail margins also increased through a combination of retail price spreads and contributions from its commercial operations function which optimizes storage and transportation assets... its storage and transportation assets. One other thing I should mention is that SouthStar recorded a lower cost of market adjustment in 2006, $6 million instance there were no similar adjustments in 2007. We did not have this $6 million dollar reduction in2007. SouthStar's operating expense increased $7 million in 2007 as compared to the prior year that was primarily due to higher payroll and incentive compensation costs as well as an increased customer care marketing costs and depreciation expenses. This was offset somewhat by lower bad debt expense. Again taking these back where we saw $20 million improvement in retail energy operations earnings before interest and taxes contribution. In the wholesale services segment I think John curbed discussion around volatility and the impact on earnings in 2007. Just to break it down our operating margin decreased $62 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 and let me walk you through the reconciliation. The main drivers are that we had a $36 million reduction hedge gains on storage and transportations in 2007 as compared to the prior year and we had a $46 million reduction in commercial activity. Commercial activities measure that we focus on as it excludes accounting adjustments on gas inventories and other hedges related to price change. The reduction in commercial activity was driven by reduced storage spreads and lower volatility in the marketplace. These decreases were offset by a $20 million reduction in lower cost of market adjustments and our inventory for 2007 net of hedging recoveries in 2006 and 2007. Operating expenses at Sequent for the year were down $6 million relative to the prior year. The decrease mainly reflects slower incentive compensation cost to the lower earnings results offset by higher other operating costs associated with the continued growth of Sequent. On an earnings before interest and taxes basis this equates to a $56 million decrease year-over-year. Lets go to energy investments. Operating margin was up $4 million reflecting a $2 million increase in interruptible margin at Jefferson Island and a $2 million increase at our AGL Networks as a result of a larger customer base and revenue stream. Operating expenses were down $1 million because of lower development costs associated with our SouthStar storage projects for the year. Our EBIT in this business segment grew $5 million or increased 50% from the previous year. Interest expenses for the year increased $2 million or about 1.6% and that was due to primarily to the increase in short term interest rates and a $3 million premium that was paid in order to redeem $75 million in trust preferred securities. This redemption premium resulted in about $0.02 per share hit their earnings in 2007 that provides longer term benefits from reducing and fixing interest expenses. Income tax expense was down $2 million in 2007 as compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower consolidated variance and slightly lower effective tax rate. John talked about the dividend increase that the board approved yesterday, which I think continues to reaffirm our commitment to investors. We also repurchased approximately 2 million share from our... of our common stock in 2007 at an aggregate cost of $80 million. We have repurchased about 3 million shares total at an aggregate cost of $180 million over the last two years under the program that the board authorized in 2006. This repurchases was enabled only because we reduced capital expenses versus expectation around our storage builds in 2007. So just to sum it up in 2007 on an aggregate basis we saw $56 million reduction in earnings before interest and taxes contributions from our wholesale services business, that was largely offset by $54 million increase in our distribution retail operations, energy investment and corporate segments. I think this just illustrates the fact that we have a good portfolio of businesses on which we generate stable returns over the long term that portfolio has a large measure of productivity built into it as more of 90% of our consolidated earnings before interest and taxes in 2007 was from regulated operations and assets that have stable reoccurring revenue streams associated with them. The utility and retail delivery content in our $2.74 is much greater than that reported in the $2.73 that we reported for 2006. As a result we are very pleased with the operation of all of our business segments relative to the prior year and relative to our plan. And as John said I think we are very well positioned going into 2008. With that we will take your questions. Question And Answer"
43,GV_001837_2008Q4,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 AGL Resources Earnings Call. My name is Kanisha and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's conference, Mr. Steve Cave, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. Steve Cave Okay. Thank you, Kanisha and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our earnings results for the fourth quarter and year-end 2008. As we normally do, we're going to focus most of our time today on reviewing the full-year results in comparison to the prior year, rather than focusing on the fourth quarter results. Our speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO, Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several other members of our management team here with us today to answer questions, following the prepared remarks. So we issued our earnings release and filed our Form 10-K this morning, and if you don't have copies of those already, you can find those on our website. Before we move to the prepared remarks, let me remind you that our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The various factors that could cause such a material difference are included in our press release and are more fully described in our 10-K filing. We also use some non-GAAP measures such as EBIT, earnings before interest and taxes, and operating margin, in describing our business and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the earnings release and the SEC filings on our website. You may also have noticed this morning, we issued another press release and made another important announcement and that is that we are changing our ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange from ATG to AGL. Over the years, we have had a number of investors ask why our ticker symbol is ATG. And the simple answer is that, when we formed the holding company AGL Resources back in 1996, the ticker symbol AGL was already taken, so we went with ATG. We learned a few months ago that the symbol AGL had become available again. So we took this opportunity to change the ticker to something that is a little more reflective of our corporate name, and that change will take effect at the opening of trading on Monday, February 9. So with that, let us begin the call with some prepared remarks from John and Drew and then, we will open the lines to take your questions. I will turn it over to John. John Somerhalder Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I will make a few brief comments about our 2008 results and our expectations for 2009 before turning it over to Drew to walk through the financial details for each business unit. We had a very good year in 2008, despite the economic conditions and the challenges around customer growth we faced in each of our service areas. Our reported results of $2.84 per diluted share resulted in record earnings for the company and at the high end of our guidance range for the year was 4% higher than $2.72 per diluted share we reported in the previous year. Each of our business units performed well during the year. Our distribution business faced several challenges through out the year, as a result of the economic downturn, including a slowdown in customer growth and an increase in bad debt expense relative to the prior year. EBIT for the distribution segment was down 3% relative to the prior year, but that was largely driven by higher expenses for incentive compensation, as we met our corporate performance targets for the year. Adjusting for those expenses, distribution operations would have been essentially flat year-over-year.  That is a very good result given the economic conditions. And it is a tribute to the way, Hank and his team really focused on managing O&M expenses throughout the year to help offset the impact of lower growth, as well as, the higher bad debt that I talked about. As we discussed during our last earnings call, we do not expect to see a significant turnaround in customer growth in our service areas throughout 2009. So, we will continue to focus our efforts on cost containment and on seeking regulatory relief, where appropriate, and I will discuss that initiative in a few minutes. Turning to the retail segment, SouthStar continued to make progress during 2008 on expanding its competitive presence to other deregulating states such as Ohio and Florida. As you know, we had expected SouthStar's earnings contribution to return to a more normal level in 2008 after having experienced an exceptionally strong performance in 2007. We did see that moderation during the year, and we also saw a slight decline in market share in Georgia, and also recorded a significant inventory valuation adjustment, which Drew will discuss in a few minutes. We expect SouthStar to continue to grow in markets outside of Georgia in 2009 and to continue its focus on maintaining its market share in the increasingly competitive Georgia retail market. Sequent finished the year with stronger than expected results, in part because of much stronger commercial activity in the business particularly during the fourth quarter. The hedge gains on transportation and storage positions also contributed to the reported results for the year. Our energy investments segment also had strong performance for the year and part of the increase reflects the fact that AGL Networks successfully constructed a network asset for a key customer. And we would not expect that to be repeatable in 2009. Networks also had improved results due to an increase in its customer base during the year. The remainder of the increase in this segment was higher interruptible margin opportunities at our Jefferson Island Storage Hub. Also, in our energy investments segment we continue to make significant progress on our Golden Triangle Storage project in Texas. Construction is on schedule and our costs continue to be within the range we have discussed previously. We have completed construction or nearing completion of construction on a number of facilities and those include four brine disposal wells, the brine line, the leeching facilities and drilling of salt at our cavern well number one. We are in the process now of commissioning those facilities and we will be able to start leeching that number one cavern well here over the next several weeks. Also we have started the drilling of cavern well number two and that is going even better than the results on the drilling of cavern well number one. We are already through the cap rock and into the salt. So the construction process for GTS is going very well and we are on track to meet our initial commercial operations target. Turning to our guidance for 2009, we have established a range of $2.65 to $2.75 per diluted share. We believe this range provides a realistic expectation for results during the year that will be challenging on a number of fronts; some of which I have already described. This range takes into account our expectations of higher pension costs of about $0.10 per share. It also assumes a return to a more normal earning level for Sequent, down from the $60 million to around $45 million; a base level year for SouthStar and that would be in the range of about $95 million or our share about $70 million; and it takes into account increased expensing of some development and maintenance costs related to our storage projects at GTS and then maintenance at our Jefferson Island facility. It assumes that the utility results will be challenged by the customer growth slowdown I described earlier. There is one other important item I want to discuss as we look ahead to 2009, and that is our expectation around upcoming rate cases. As you know, we're filing four rate cases over the next two years, beginning with our filing in New Jersey in less than a month. We believe the fundamental long-term earnings outlook for our utility business is strong, despite the economic challenge we are facing. We also believe that the upcoming rate proceedings provide the opportunity to establish rates in each of our jurisdictions that will fairly compensate our investors for the capital deployed in those businesses. We expect these rate resets to begin by early 2010. As you know, we entered into a long-term rate stay- outs in our major jurisdictions several years ago. The structure afforded us the opportunity to manage -- to effectively manage our cost structure and to find organic ways to grow our business in order to avoid seeking rate relief through the regulatory process. We have done that through rigorous attention to cost containment. At the same time, we have invested in annual rate base growth; that is in the range of 2% to 3%, depending on the jurisdiction. The Hampton Roads Crossing project or pipeline replacement program and the Magnolia project are all examples of the prudent investments we have made in the business to improve the quality, reliability and overall value of the services we provide to our customers. This higher rate of capital investment in our core utility operations, the higher depreciation expenses associated with that capital spending and an increase in our costs such as pension and health care expenses combined with the recent slow down in customer growth has resulted in essentially flat earnings contribution from the utility business over the past year. As a result, prudent recovery of this cost to successful rate case outcomes will be an important component of ensuring that rates remain sufficient to recover the capital deployed in our utility business. Clearly, it is too early in the game for us to provide many details around our filings. We have a history of working cooperatively and in a constructive manner with regulators and we operate in states where the regulatory commissions have shown a willingness to provide appropriate rate relief to other utilities operating in those states. We have been encouraged by recent regulatory decisions, as they signal a willingness on the part of regulators to compensate utilities for the infrastructure investment they have made and continue to make; to better serve customers at a reasonable price. If you look at our track record of regulatory accomplishments going back a few years, I think it speaks well of our ability to reach balance solutions with our regulators and to the opportunity we have to achieve fair and reasonable outcomes in each jurisdiction. Some examples of that success include our recent successful outcomes in rate cases in Tennessee and Maryland; the approvals we received in Florida for amortization of the acquisition premium; the approvals we have received in Virginia for conservation and de-coupling programs, as well as for the collection of AFUDC for the Hampton Roads Crossing pipeline project. Also in each of our jurisdictions, we have worked cooperatively with regulators to design commission approved asset management agreements that benefit customers, through sharing for fixed fee arrangements. We have had a number of successes and we will be working hard over the next couple of years on the regulatory front to build on that track record. With that, I will turn it over to, Drew for the financial discussion. Andrew Evans Thanks, John. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As we point out in our disclosures and as John discussed, clearly the hedge gains at Sequent had a positive effect on earnings for the year, but these were offset by lower-of-cost-or-market or LOCOM inventory adjustments made for both Sequent and SouthStar, as a result of declining natural gas prices. I will walk you through those bearings in a minute, but let us start with distribution operations. In the distribution segment, EBIT was down $9 million in 2008 relative to 2007 or less than a 3% decline. Operating margin of $818 was down by only $2 million, primarily the result of lower customer usage offset partially by higher pipeline replacement revenues at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown Gas and some modest customer growth year-over-year. Operating expenses were up $8 million, but that was largely a function of higher incentive compensation expenses across all of our businesses, as a result of higher consolidated corporate earnings and of exceeding our corporate goals for 2008. As John pointed out, adjusting for those expenses, the distribution segment was relatively flat year-over-year. We also had to overcome $7 million of higher depreciation costs and $5 million of additional bad debt expense relative to the prior year. So, you can see the effects of our cost control containment in the segment. Overall, I would say, our utility business performed admirably during the first -- during one of the historical worst residential housing markets with the focus on reducing controllable expense. John described our strong focus on our upcoming rate cases, and I would just add that while we continue to look for cost management opportunities and margin increases through organic growth, rate cases will be a fixture of our operating landscape for the foreseeable future. Our retail segment, SouthStar, reported lower results for the year, with an EBIT contribution of $57 million down from $83 million in 2007. This contribution represents our 75% share of the earnings from that business, while the minority interest we reported reflects the feed mark portion of the earnings. The 2008 reported results for SouthStar were somewhat perturbed by lower cost or market inventory valuation adjustments in the latter half of the year. SouthStar had $17 million of LOCOM adjustments impacting its full-year results and did not have any similar adjustments in the prior year. Even adding back the $17 million adjustments to the 2008 results, SouthStar's earnings were lower year-over-year and that was consistent with what we discussed with investors early in 2008. SouthStar clearly had some market commercial opportunities that drove its 2007 results to a significantly higher level than we had seen before and we expected to see some normalization of these results in 2008. One of the challenges we have faced with SouthStar has been the increasing competitive nature of the market in Georgia; with overall growth slowing all marketers are competing for a bigger share of a fairly stagnant market. In addition, the economic conditions have resulted in much more consumer price shopping then we have seen in the past and more customers shipping to fixed-price plans rather than floating on a variable plan. What these dynamics have meant for SouthStar is that we have seen market share decline year-over-year in the one percentage point range, although we still maintain our leading market share with 34% of the total market. SouthStar has done an excellent job of managing bad debt expense and maintains the credit quality of its customer portfolio; no small task in the current environment. The wholesale services business segment, which consists primarily of Sequent, contributed EBIT of $60 million in 2008, which was a $26 million increase over 2007 results. Operating margin was up $45 million which is a combination of three principle factors. The first is that, Sequent had a $25 million year-over-year increase in commercial activity from $61 million in 2007 to $86 million in 2008. The increase resulted from higher market volatility related to late summer, tropical storm activity in the Golf Coast region and colder weather in the fourth quarter. Commercial activity is generally a good way to gauge economic value created and recognized during a given period. The second factor is that we recognized the $35 million increase in storage and transportation hedge gains and the third factor is the negative impact of $15 increase of net low comp adjustments; all these reconciliation items are listed in our 10-K on page 34. Operating expenses for the wholesale service segment were up $19 million year-over-year. The most significant component of the increase was related to the method by which we compensate employees in that segment, which is based on a percentage of EBIT, but headcount related to our base business and expansion into more commercial and industrial marketing activities also played a role. The important take away for Sequent is that business had a very good year from an economic standpoint. Sequent performed better than we had anticipated for the year with much of that performance coming in the latter half of the year. Turning to energy, the energy investments segment, AGL Networks had a strong year in terms of generating a new business and largely drove the EBIT increase of $4 million year-over-year for the segment. Jefferson Island operating margin was $3 million higher year-over-year, but operating expenses and legal work around the expansion of the Jefferson Island project absorbed that gain. Interest expense was down $10 million year-over-year and that was due primarily to lower short-term interest rates, partially offset by higher average debt outstanding. Also, our 2007 interest expense included the $3 million premium we paid for early redemption of the $75 million in notes payable. I want to take a minute to talk about our pension liability, as I know that is probably on top of mind for many company investors given the significantly lower asset values resulting from the market downturn. While, we were not required to make a pension contribution in 2008, we are expecting 2009 to be required to make a minimum contribution in our pension plans of $7 million. We could make additional contributions in 2009 up to $61 million for a total of up to $68 million in order to preserve the current level of benefits under the plans in accordance with the funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act. We expect our pensions and [personnel] retirement expenses for 2009 to be approximately $50 million higher than in 2008, which as John pointed out, clearly has a negative impact on our earnings expectation for the year as reflected in our earnings guidance range. Before we go to Q&A, we would just like to reiterate what we said in our last earnings call about our view of the credit markets and liquidity. We have a strong facility in place. We maintain sizable buffers in that facility, over and above our working capital requirements even during peak injection periods, and we have had no significant exposure to banks that collapsed in 2008. On the table -- the table on page 78 of the 10-K provides more detail on our credit facility and outstanding borrowings and you can see that we currently have $773 million outstanding relative to our $1.1 billion in total capacity. This is a function of the higher gas prices and inventory builds last summer; we have seen better access to the commercial paper markets recently. We have continued to draw on our lines because of the favorable rates relative to commercial paper. Now that we are past our peak working capital needs and we are in the cash collection cycle, as customers pay their [rental] bills, you will see the outstanding borrowings reduced significantly over the next few months. We pay close attention to maturity -- or to the maturing of our assets and liabilities and we have no significant maturities in 2009 and we expect to build summer inventories that cost significantly lower than last year. One other thing I should note is that our dividend policy is stable growth, now that we have come in line with our peer group payout ratio. The Board has increased dividends by $0.01 per quarter consistent with the long-term view of sustainable growth for our businesses. This represents only about a $3.5 million increase in that obligation for us each year. I think that covers the highlights. With that, we can go to your questions."
44,GV_001837_2009Q4,"Presentation Unknown Speaker <strong>Operator</strong> Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Q4 2009 AGL Resources earnings conference call. My name is Janita and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today Mr. Steve Cave, Vice President of Finance. Please proceed. <strong>Steve Cave</strong> Okay thank you Janita and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our 2009 earnings results. The speakers on the call today will be John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President, and CEO and Drew Evans our Executive Vice President and CFO. We have several other members of our management team here with us today to answer questions following the prepared remarks. As you know, we issued our earnings release and filed our form 10-K before the market opened. If you don't have copies of those documents you can find them on our website. Before we remove to the prepared remarks, let me remind you that our discussion today may contain forward looking statements, and that our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements. The various factors that could cause such material difference are included in our press released and are more fully described in our 10-K filing. We also used some non-GAAP measures in describing our business and a reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and our SEC filings and is available on our website. We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks and then we'll open the lines to take your questions. And with that, let me turn it over to John. <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Thank you, Steve and good morning. I will make a few brief comments about our 2009 results, and our expectations for 2010, before turning it over to Drew [giving] you the financial details for each of the business units. We had a very strong year, very good year of 2009. With strong performances from each of our business units. Our reported results of $2.88 per diluted share were record earnings for our company. These results reflected an exceptionally strong finish to the year, particularly as we saw significantly colder than normal weather in Georgia and in fact in most of our service areas. And volatility in the wholesale gas markets that created additional opportunities for Sequent to capture and create economic value. They also reflect significantly lower interest expense year-over-year which was primarily driven by lower, shorter term rates. On our 3rd quarter call, we said we expected our 2009 earnings results to be at the high end of our guidance range, or slightly higher, assuming normal weather and an average level of volatility during the 4th quarter. However, the factors I just mentioned resulted in a very strong finish to the year for both SouthStar and Sequent. And drove earnings to a level that was about $0.10 above our expectation. We have initiated 2010 earnings guidance in the range of $2.95 to $3.05 per diluted share. The mid point of this range represents about a 4% year-over-year growth in earnings. We should point out that in addition to assuming normal weather; our guidance for the year assumes no meaningful return to customer growth in our utility business this year. It also assumes a return to a more normalized level of earnings for SouthStar. Before Drew discusses our business units' results, I would like to highlight a few of the recent successes we have had from an operational and from a regulatory standpoint. As you know, we have been working on two significant utility pipeline projects, and I am happy to report that both of these projects are now in commercial operations. In Virginia, we placed the Hampton Roads Crossing project into commercial operation during the first week in January. The pipeline connects the northern and southern areas of our Virginia natural gas distribution system, improving the reliability and access to supply for [B and G's] customers. And we also have long term capacity contracts also this pipeline to serve two utilities in the region. In Georgia we put the Magnolia pipeline project in service back in November. You may recall that this project included the purchase of an undivided interest in some of Southern Natural Gas assets that we combined with existing Atlanta Gas Light distribution pipeline to create a firm transportation path into the Atlanta market from Elba island. The result there is that we now have an additional 84,000 dekatherms per day of capacity available to serve our customers. We continue to execute around our regulatory strategy throughout 2009. In December the New Jersey board of public utilities approved our settlement agreement in the Elizabethtown rate case. Under the agreement Elizabethtown Gas will increase base rates by $2.9 million. Marking the first increase in rates there in seven years. The change in depreciation rates approved as part of the settlement will reduce our depreciation expense by $5 million. As a result, the total increase at EBIT associated with the settlement will be around $8 million. In November, we filed a rate case in Tennessee, seeking a $2.6 million increase in base rates. We have not filed a general rate case in Tennessee in more than three years. And this filings requests the modest increase to cover rising operating costs and capital investments, we have made in that business. Our case also requests a rate alignment factor, which is a form of decoupling design to remove the [disincentive] for selling less natural gas and that allows us to promote customer conservation and energy efficiency programs. In Georgia, we received approval in January and that was approval of Atlanta Gas Light's filing to spend up to $45 million under a new program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas where gas service is not currently available. The program will operate as part of our STRIDE initiative. And the $45 million is an addition to that $176 million approved last year for STRIDE for the first three years of that program. The new program will not increase monthly rates for customers. As it will be collected through with three year extension of the existing STRIDE surcharge. More importantly, these investments have no regulatory lag and the recovery mechanism has already been determined and requires no additional rate activity. Also in early January, we closed on the transaction to purchase an additional 15% ownership interest in the SouthStar Energy Services joint venture. We paid $57.5 million for the additional interest and will now own 85% of the business and will receive 85% of the annual earnings. Turning to our storage projects, we continue to make good progress on building out the first cavern of the Golden Triangle storage facility in Texas. We are expecting to put Cavern One in service during the second half of this year. We are moving forward with the permitting process for the expansion of the Jefferson Island storage facility. We continue to believe that Jefferson Island is a premiere location for rapid cycle, high deliverability storage and we have seen that the interest from our customers is at a high level, and that demonstrates that the service requirements far exceed our available capacity. Our operating agreement with the state of Louisiana was approved by the general board in December. And that has cleared the way for us to restart the permitting process in order to get the expansion back on track. We anticipate getting the necessary approvals to move forward by year-end, and that will allow us to begin construction early next year. These are the major highlights for the year. We feel very good about our performance in 2009 and very good about our ability to deliver on our 2010 plan. With that I'll turn it over to Drew for the financial review. <strong>Drew Evans</strong> Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I'll cover the major earnings drivers for the year for each business unit, but you can also find very good schedules in our 10-K, that reconcile earnings in each business unit by line item. In our distribution business, we had a solid year, especially given the slight declines in customer accounts year-over-year. 2009 EBIT was $326 million, compared with $329 million in 2008. Operating margin increased by $18 million year-over-year, and that was driven by four main factors. The first and largest driver was an $8 million increase in the margin from storage carrying costs. We charge marketers in Georgia for natural gas stored on their behalf. If you recall when we store gas in our system on behalf of the marketers in Georgia, we collect carrying charges on that inventory. And since inventory levels and costs have been higher this year, our margins from that activity are higher than last year. We also have incurred higher cost per carrying it on their behalf. Other factors driving high operating margins were pipeline replacement revenues, which were up $6 million relative to last year as result of increased investments. Revenue from the Hampton Roads and Magnolia pipeline projects which contributed $2 million above the prior year's results. And reduction in earnings volatility granted in Virginia as part of rate making there this year. Operating expenses for the utilities were up $26 million year-over-year, relative to the prior year the major factors were an increase of $12 million for pension expense, higher payroll and incentive compensation costs of $12 million and higher depreciation expense of $6 million. These expenses were offset partially by $5 million in lower costs attributed to fleet fuel costs, marketing expenses, and bad debt expense. Turning to the retail segment SouthStar's 2009 EBIT results were a $105 million. That's $28 million higher than in 2008. Keep in mind that the 2008 results included $24 million in lower of cost or inventory evaluation adjustments, as compared to only $6 million in 2009. So, an $18 million improvement year- over-year. If you exclude these adjustments, the underlying business performed about $10 million better than last year. SouthStar's strong results were largely driven by improvements in retail margins in Georgia and higher contributions from the Ohio market. The results also reflect significantly colder weather during the fourth quarter, particularly in December. Weather in the fourth quarter was 8% colder than in 2008 and13% colder than the 10-year average. Operating expenses at SouthStar were up $3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher marketing and incentive compensation costs. SouthStar continues to experience aggressive competition for customers in the Georgia market and we expect that trend to continue in the foreseeable future. We have seen some positive signs the vast decline in market share in recent months are starting to turn around, and the number of customers moving to the lower margin fixed price plans has started to stabilize as well. In addition to stepping up its marketing efforts in Georgia, SouthStar will also continue to focus on growing its presence in the Ohio market through participation in the unbundled auction process there. Now turning to the wholesale segment, we reported EBIT of $47 million, down $13 million relative to last year. An $11 million decline in operating margin reflects lower commercial activity realized during the year. The real story however for wholesale in 2009, is that we created significant economic value in both the storage and transportation segments of our business, but the transportation value was realized during the year while the majority of our storage value will be realized in 2010. We did not see significant hedge gains or loss on storage in 2009, so year-over-year our storage gains declined by $36 million as we saw significant hedge movement in 2008. Offsetting that, was a $36 million year-over-year increase in realized gains as a result of our ability to capture profits on transportation positions in 2009, relative to last year as we saw basis spreads narrow significantly during the year. If you look at the storage inventory outlook section of the 10-K that's on page 8, we show an inventory withdrawal schedule for Sequent, so you can see the significant storage value Sequent was able to create during the year. That schedule shows that we entered 2010 with $30 million of expected operating revenues from our storage positions that we expect to realize primarily in the first quarter of this year, assuming no major changes in the cycling of our inventory as the market conditions change. As you may recall, Sequent started 2009 with virtually no storage inventory roll out from 2008, and our historical average is closer to about $12 million. Operating expenses for the wholesale segment increased $2 million, mainly as a result of higher incentive cost in that segment. In the energy investment segment, we record EBIT of $12 million, that's down $7 million from last year. The decline is primarily related to lower interruptible revenues at Jefferson Island and higher business development expense for Golden Triangle and other future projects. Also, revenue for AGL networks was lower as a result of a network expansion project we completed and sold to a customer in 2008. We had a similar project, but smaller project in 2009. As John mentioned, one of the other major drivers of improved earnings results year-over-year with significantly lower interest expense, interest expense for 2009 was $101 million which was down $14 million relative to the prior year. The year over year changes largely is a function of lower short-term rates we have seen in the commercial paper markets in 2009 relative to 2008. Finally, the Board of Directors voted to increase dividends by a penny per quarter which increases our dividend to $0.44 per quarter. This is the 249th consecutive quarterly dividends since 1948. Those are the highlights, so let's go to your questions. <strong>Question-and Answer Session</strong> <strong>Operator</strong> Your first question comes from the line of Barry Klein with Citi. Please proceed. <strong>Barry Klein - Citi</strong> Question on the guidance for 2010. With regards to the utility you had some higher sharing revenues in 2009 versus 2008 and 2007. These levels expected to be at these elevated levels going forward, or are you expecting more of a reversion back to the 2008, 2007 levels? <strong>Drew Evans</strong> Barry, could you give us a little bit more detail on the revenues that you are speaking about? <strong>Barry Klein - Citi </strong> Isn't there on page 8, I think you discussed it in the comments about asset management transactions that are profit sharing, page 8 of the 10-K. <strong>Drew Evans</strong> I think the simplest way to answer is it's a function of how much margin is created Sequent around the management of the utility assets. The agreements won't change materially in 2010. And so to the extent that Sequent is able to make more money around particularly storage and transportation assets than the sharing amount with the utilities will increase. But these aren't the functionals of significantly higher bailment payments year-over-year. <strong>Doug Schantz</strong> Obviously we do have some minimums on the contracts, but given where we see storage spreads, storage spreads for that business have been very attractive. Transport times can be stressed but I don't see any major fundamental changes, on a whole if you look at the value that's been created. <strong>Barry Klein - Citi </strong> And with regard to Sequent and also that schedule on page 8 that I think Drew was talking about with the withdrawal schedule and the expected operating revenues, are those revenues locked in? Is it dollar amount of those revenue locked in and it's just the question of timing, or could those revenues potentially fluctuate? <strong>Doug Schantz</strong> Those are locked in. They are hedged. Most of the volumes there have to be withdrawn by the end of the withdrawal period so since its reservoir storage. So, I would say the majority of that's locked into first quarter withdrawals. <strong>Barry Klein - Citi </strong> And was there any increase in pension, pension expenses expected for 2010? <strong>Drew Evans</strong> Yeah, because of the way averaging works around pension it covers a three to five year period depending on who the master is and we'll have one of the good years roll off and we'll move into another year of measuring the asset against its performance in 2008, so we'll see about a $3 million increase year-over- year in pension expense. <strong>Operator</strong> Your next question comes from the line of Carl Kirst of BMO Capital. Please proceed. <strong>Carl Kirst - BMO Capital</strong> John, you mentioned the fact that you expect SouthStar to kind of go back to more normalized level, and we kind of have a little bit of the erosion from moving to the flat pricing plans. And one I just wanted to if we could kind of dead reckon again what you think the normalized earnings power of SouthStar is sort of post this migration to the flat pricing system. And Drew, you've mentioned that there seems to be now a stabilization of retail customers moving to that plan. Is there anyway to quantify what the percentage of customers that currently have that fixed price versus variable plans, so we can sort of track that? <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Carl, let me take the first part of the question. If you look at how SouthStar performed for the year compared to the original guidance range we put forward. And you look at the extra income that they generated primarily in the 4th quarter because of cold weather, it was a big part of that extra $0.10 gap that we had at the end of the year. So either one of those measures are more normalized set of earnings at normal weather conditions with the customer mix and the customer account we have now, it is in the range of close to $10 million lower than how we performed for 2009. So that sets the base expectation. And then I will let Mike Braswell or Drew talk about the customer mix. <strong>Drew Evans</strong> Sure. If you are looking at the percent of fix price customer that has been around the low 20% range. And again we expect that to stabilize in 2010. We can certainly provide that percentage on an going basis, Tom. It hasn't changed materially from the beginning of 2009 to about where we are today. Again it has been in the low 20% range. It really jumped up in 2008. <strong>Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets</strong> That's very helpful. And then if I could just shift to Sequent as we look forward to what is baked into 2010 guidance, is there anyway to, and lord knows with market conditions these buckets will shift around, but just as you look at it today we have got $30 million coming in from storage. How are you viewing the composition or the strength perhaps from the transport as well as commercial activity? Commercial activity really took a hit in 2009. Do you see that coming back at all, or are we going to be in sort of a sustained low-level for the foreseeable future? <strong>Drew Evans</strong> This is Drew. What I say about commercial activity it's the way we capture it excludes what was generated on transportation this year, and so we locked ourselves into its calculation a little bit and so I'm not sure if it is quite a strong an indicator as it has been in the past. One of the things that we are looking at for guidance for 2010 and we will go through each of the different components when we have our analyst meeting, I guess its the month after next, its that we really don't want to have a great deal of reliance on trading as a large component of our total earnings generated. And so it is going to look a bit more normalized even though we have a strong roll out schedule coming in. But I think what we are trying to stick to is a base plan where Sequent's core earnings grow a modest amount year-over-year but certainly don't anticipate 2010 having a significantly larger percentage of our total earnings coming out of the business. <strong>Doug Schantz</strong> Carl, this is Doug. Obviously you hit on the nail about the buckets. Buckets will move around. Transportation has been stressed recently but storage has been very attractive to us. Our deal count is up. It will be up 2010 over 2009 we have a lot of good transactions being added to the mix. And a key part of what happened last year in terms of commercial activity was kind of the mild summer we had with no storms in the Gulf. So that was a major piece of that. It gets into weather and it gets into the different buckets, what's going to be attractive or not. But clearly, we are well optimistic about 2010. <strong>Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets</strong> Great, and then last question if I could just with respect to the incremental $45 million that was in effect lumped into the STRIDE program. The STRIDE tariff if I recall correctly went out into something like the 2020 time frame? This has just basically extended that out? <strong>Drew Evans</strong> That's right, Carl. It is 2022 and it extended into 2025. <strong>Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets</strong> Okay. But the $45 million is going to be spent this year or is that also spread out over the three years like the 176? <strong>Drew Evans</strong> That's over the three-year period. <strong>Operator</strong> Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Rosenthal that with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed. <strong>Ryan Rosenthal - Sidoti & Company</strong> Question concerning SouthStar. I think John mentioned earlier that he guided about $10 million lower for EBIT out for next year relative to this year. Is that exclusive of the benefit for the 15% additional purchase of your joint venture? <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Yeah, what I was talking about there and that's a very good point. What we were talking about is overall earnings at SouthStar. And so if you just look at the change on SouthStar returning to normal weather, it was in that range year-over-year. However, with the purchase of the 15% interest then if you look at our interest in this it is very similar year-over-year because of that change. <strong>Ryan Rosenthal - Sidoti & Company</strong> Great. And then just one question concerning your storage cavern investments, can you give us an update as far as where you are on scheduling or you're planning on I want to be adding those new caverns over the next several years? I guess following some of the regulatory announcements overt his last quarter? <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Yeah, the general schedule is very much in line with what it has been over the last year. Things are going very well at Golden Triangle. And we do anticipate based upon the schedule we see today that we will be in the process early in the second half of this year starting to put Cavern 1 in service. As soon as we start that process we move to leaching out Cavern 2 there and what that allows us to do is head towards a schedule of putting Cavern 2 in service early in 2012. So that’s very much in line with what we talked about earlier. With Jefferson Island, as you have heard, we are now back on track to move the permitting process forward. We expect that, that will take the majority of this year to move through , and that would allow us to start drilling the Cavern 3 and starting to leach it out early in that year which basically would be an 18-month process or so after that to get that cavern in service. So that's roughly the schedule for the next three caverns that we put in service. <strong>Ryan Rosenthal - Sidoti & Company</strong> Great, thanks for your time. thanks. <strong>Operator</strong> Your next question comes from the line of Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs, please proceed. <strong>Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs</strong> I guess maybe just a little more macro on storage. How are you seeing the market in the Gulf Coast shaping up in terms of the supply demand fundamentals around storage? <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Yeah, Ted. We look at that in a number of ways. We obviously have several data points. We talk to outside consultants and they do a longer term analysis of that. We are in the process of recontracting, as an example, on a regular basis Jefferson Island. So we have those data points and obviously Sequent is in the market for storage on a regular basis. And we have those data points as well. And what we have seen recently for storage located at the right place like Jefferson Island, we have seen a return to a positive trend. As you all know coming off the volatility we saw with Katrina and Rita, we saw the strongest market value for high deliverability storage. That came off in a year and a half ago; a year ago we saw lower points. We have now seen that strengthen to some extent. Very much in line with the pro-forma economics we put forward for our storage project. So at least what we are seeing today is a strengthening of storage spreads. But I wouldn't say they are going back to the levels we saw coming out of Katrina and Rita. But we did not anticipate that. But certainly a strengthening. So that's what we are seeing in the market. And the long-term fundamentals we believe with announcements like we saw from Progress Energy converting I think it was 14 plants. They were smaller coal plants, but converting to natural gas. And a number of natural gas plants that have been installed that are running the low load factors that we think for environmental and other reasons we'll start to see higher load factors. We still feel very good about the strength of the natural gas market and that does drive the need for high deliverable storage to serve those. And then obviously, one of the things will monitor is LNG and how that comes into the country. That can drive value for storage as well. That one we are still a little more in a wait and see mode. We will learn a lot this year as certain terminals come on-line and we will see how that plays out. Our belief though still is the fundamental value of high deliverability storage in the Gulf Coast is very strong. <strong>Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs</strong> Okay. I guess in terms of Golden Triangle, I would assume you will probably see better rates down at Jefferson Island than would at Golden Triangle? What are you thinking of the difference between those two? <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Jefferson Island is really a premier location given the liquidity around the Henry hub and how it is connected. Yes, we have always anticipated and in everything we've looked at we expect stronger rates. However, Golden Triangle has some advantages as well. It is in a corridor where we believe LNG will come in intermittently. And when that comes in it needs to find a home temporarily before the market given those cargos coming in. It uniquely is connected to pipelines to serve Florida so that has some advantages. So yes, we see Jefferson Island as a premium facility, but we do see value in Golden Triangle as well, but clearly a lower level. And that's what we anticipated when we put together the economics on that project. <strong>Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs</strong> And then shifting back over to the Elizabethtown. I think you'd asked for decoupling originally. Did that not come out in the settlement or where did you end up on that? <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> I will let Hank Linginfelter go into that. <strong>Hank Linginfelter</strong> Thanks, John and thanks, Ted for the question. It did come out as a phase 2 of the rate proceeding. And the BPU has authorized us the opportunity to file a plan that we think will look a lot like the plans they have already approved in New Jersey. And the schedule for that is sometime for the first half of the year. I think we will have it filed and it will take a while for them to work through the proceeding, but we are moving forward with that. <strong>Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs</strong> Great. And if I could just one more on terms of the Atlanta Gas Light rate case, I think you previously said you would be looking for a single digit rate increase. Is that still what you are thinking, or where are you thinking on that? <strong>Hank Linginfelter</strong> We hope it will be higher. When you say single digit I don't know if you mean single digit percentage or? <strong>Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs</strong> Yeah, percentage, rate increase. <strong>Hank Linginfelter</strong> It may be single digit percentage on base rates or on total bill, but we are looking for pretty aggressive increase there just because it has been a long time since Atlanta Gas Lights has had one and we have a good case for an increase in Georgia. <strong>Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs</strong> Just remind us, is it a historical test here or do you get any sort of forward look on that? <strong>Hank Linginfelter] We do some forward looking and we update it as the case goes on for certain factors, but it is more forward looking than most of our jurisdictions. <strong>Operator</strong> (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers investments. Please proceed. <strong>Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers</strong> Tuohy Brothers. It has been a little bit for me, so I apologize if I have got simple questions. But just curious on your view if you see unregulated storage as a possible fit for MLP status. Would that be a consideration in the future? <strong>Drew Evans</strong> This is Drew. No question. I think you have to certainly get the critical mass on mid-stream assets before going through the (inaudible) of creating an MLP mix makes financial sense. We really need additional revenues out of Golden Triangle both phase 1 and phase 2 before something like that becomes immediately practical. I think there are certain combinations we could make in the near term that would allow us to access that market. We do that analysis almost continually. <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> And I think clearly Cavern 1 in service puts us much closer to that point that Drew is talking about. And Cavern 2 clearly puts us in range for that being a possibility. <strong>Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers</strong> Great. And the second question, years ago the focus or the mantra was, we are the efficient guys. We're going to keep rates flat, but look for profit sharing to maximize the use of otherwise under utilized or inefficiently deployed utility assets with your management trading arm. And I'm wondering if that's, given the increase in costs over time and pension expense and everything else, if that's still a focus for you to focus on sharing profits and future rate cases off the assets of the utilities, or if you are more into total rate recovery on increasing costs, and where you think the mindset of all of the jurisdictions are in terms of being willing to share these synergies on the utility assets. <strong>John Somerhalder</strong> Let me start and then I will let Hank finish the information. But clearly our focus has been and will continue to be a very efficient preferred operator of utility assets. And that is what has helped us very much over the last five years as we have had these longer term rate stay outs. And if you look at our metrics related to cost per customer and some of those things, we continue to benchmark very well. As you recognize, things like pension costs have gone up. The good news is we were at a logical point close to the end of a lot of the rate case freezes or agreements to stay out. So it was prudent for us, in fact, it was required in most jurisdictions to go back. It was very good timing for us to true up those costs. Our focus still will be, moving forward, though to minimize the cost on our customers and to help our shareholders to keep costs under control. So it will still be a strong focus. The fact that we went back in and trued up rates was really more a requirement of the last rate stay out. And it was very good timing for us as well. But we are still in that mode of controlling our costs and plan to continue to do that and Hank can add a little more detail. <strong>Hank Linginfelter</strong> Sure, I would add, Craig, that on the sharing components, I think all of the jurisdictions, we have a contract with Sequent in every jurisdiction for asset management have grown to appreciate Sequent's transparency and ability to share, all the details on how they do business. And now I would say our regulators across every jurisdiction favor the affiliate relationship just philosophically. They appreciate how Sequent manages those assets and can disclose all the details around them. And I think we will continue to see that as favorable. We may face some bidding in some jurisdictions, but also some have said we would rather just extend if there is no other business to do. And we will probably have something like that, that will come with the phase 2 of the Elizabethtown rate case for Sequent. And then I think John's points about cost-efficiency just will continue to manage very carefully. You might recall over the last several years we have been integrating acquisitions and we get synergies from those as well and customers and various jurisdictions benefit from those synergies because we spread our costs over a bigger footprint and to the extent we will find those we will continue to do it. But we know we will be in more rate cases in the near term than we've been in the last five years. <strong>Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers</strong> So you don't see any of the expense relief you were just talking about resulting in any push back on the profit-sharing side? <strong>Hank Linginfelter</strong> No, I don't think so. <strong>Operator</strong> There are no further questions in the queue. <strong>Steve Cave</strong> Okay. Well thank you very much for joining us today. Obviously give us a call with any follow-up questions you may have. Have a good day. <strong>Operator</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."
45,GV_001837_2010Q4,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the AGL Resources fourth quarter 2010 and year end earnings conference call. My name is Keisha and I’ll be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen only mode. We will conduct a question and answer session towards the end of this conference. If at any time during the call you require assistance please press star, 0 and the operator will be happy to assist you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Sarah Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah Stashak Thank you Keisha and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review our fourth quarter and 2010 earnings results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO, Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and Form 10-K filing are now available on our Web site. If you do not have copies of those you can go to our Web site at aglresources.com to find them. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our company presentation as well as on our Web site. We’ll begin the call with some prepared remarks today before taking your questions. And with that I’ll turn it over to Drew. Andrew Evans Thanks Sarah and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3 of our company presentation you can see that we reported 2010 earnings of a record $3 per diluted share or $3.05 per share excluding costs related to the Nicor merger we announced in December. On an adjusted basis these results are up 17 cents or 6% from 2009. In addition, operating income was up by 5% year over year. Our fourth quarter results were 81 cents per diluted share or 86 cents adjusted for Nicor related costs. This compares to fourth quarter 2009 EPS of 92 cents. On the whole, results for both the year and fourth quarter were at the upper end of our guidance range due in large part to an unusually cold December across much of the US. The strong finish to the year, the effect of new infrastructure investments and rate programs as well as ongoing expense discipline drove record results. Turning to Slide 4, you can see our solid track record of EPS and dividend growth. We continue to expect earnings increases of about 4-6% per year going forward and we maintain our policy of increasing dividends while growing earnings. I’ll speak more to the specifics of our earnings guidance in a few minutes but you can see here that our guidance for 2011 is for diluted earnings per share of between $3.10-3.20 excluding any impacts from the Nicor transaction. And I’m pleased to report that yesterday our board of directors approved the ninth dividend increase for AGL Resources’ shareholders since 2002. Our expected dividend for 2011 is now $1.80. Moving on to Slide 5 you’ll find a snapshot of earnings before interest and taxes by segment. On the left you can see that despite volatile conditions in the natural gas market over the past few years we’ve managed to produce stable and consistent results across the business. And on the right, note that our distribution business continues to be the largest contributor to EBIT, representing 59% of total EBIT in 2010. Retail accounted for 20%, wholesale for 10% and energy investments for the remainder. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting on Slide 6. Just as a reminder, the revenue metric does not carry a particularly heavy weight for most of our business segments as it’s influenced by the price of natural gas, which is passed through to our customers in most instances. Revenues will be driven by volume and price, to which we are largely agnostic. So beginning with our distribution business, it performed very well in 2010. EBIT was up $29 million compared to last year. The increase is principally due to the addition of earnings from the pipeline projects we put into service last year, Hampton Roads Crossing in Virginia and Magnolia Project in Georgia. Our new regulatory infrastructure and rate programs at Atlanta Gas Light and Elizabethtown also contributed to this increase. EBIT in the fourth quarter was up 12% versus fourth quarter of 2009 with similar drivers to our annual results. We continued our discipline in controlling costs throughout the year. Our operating expenses excluding the cost of gas in the distribution segment increased just 2%, which is primarily a function of expected higher payroll, compensation and benefits cost. Turning to the retail segment Salstar on Slide 7, we recorded EBIT of $103 million for 2010, down just 2 million from last year. EBIT for the fourth quarter was also down $2 million versus fourth quarter of 2009. As was the case with most of our businesses, extremely cold conditions in first quarter and fourth quarter resulted in increased customer usage across our customer base. However, these favorable weather conditions were offset by the effect of continued strong competition for customers in the Georgia market and a continuing but slowing migration to fixed price plans, which generally produce lower margin. While we consistently use EBIT as a key measure for each of our segments, at the retail business it’s important to point out that due to our increased stake in Salstar to 85% which went effective January 1st, net income was actually up $11 million year over year as we retained a greater percentage of net earnings. By utilizing marketing and customer retention programs, Salstar successfully maintained stable market share of 33% in Georgia in 2010 with our customer count remaining around 500,000. Salstar continues to explore opportunities outside of Georgia to strengthen our offering and expand our customer base. You’ll find results from our wholesale services segment on Slide 8. Sequent performance was slightly impacted by cold weather in the first and fourth quarters as I mentioned earlier, as well as very low natural gas price volatility, which persisted throughout the year. We recorded 2010 EBIT of $49 million, a $2 million increase over 2009. We have seen a $10 million improvement in year over year commercial activity and OEM expenses in this business have declined 12% or $7 million mainly as a result of lower incentive compensation costs. Sequent had a strong finish to the year with the cold December weather possibly impacting the asset values in our eastern US and Gulf Coast gas portfolios as pipeline constraints on several eastern pipelines increased the value of firm assets. As a result, our wholesale services fourth quarter EBIT was $11 million, which is half of what it was in the previous quarter largely as a result of $3 million in mark to market losses during the fourth quarter versus $9 million of mark to market gains in the fourth quarter of 2009. The mark to market impact in 2010 resulted from changes in forward nimax prices, which impacted storage hedges and changes in forward basis differentials, which impacted transportation hedges. As we head into 2011 we have $16 million in operating revenues embedded in the store roll out schedule for the year. This is consistent with our five-year average of about $15 million. 13 million is currently expected to be recognized in the first quarter but as we’ve noted, our withdrawal schedule can change depending on market conditions and changes in gas price. Moving quickly to our energy investment segment, which is detailed in Slide 9, you can see that our 2010 EBIT of $4 million was down significantly from the $12 million we recorded in 2009. This is largely due to the sale of AGL Networks in July of this year. By way of reference, AGL Networks contributed roughly $8 million of EBIT in 2009 versus $3 million in 2010. We’ll be looking for an increased revenue contribution from Golden Triangle Storage Cavern 1 in 2011 as it came online in September of last year. Currently we have two BCF under contract and we’re looking to optimize the remaining four BCF as the year progresses. Total remaining CapEx for this project is approximately $40 million. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 10. During 2010 we successfully completed nearly $1.2 billion of refinancing activity including the renewal of our $1 billion senior credit facility that supports our commercial paper program and refinancing of $161 million in credit facilities backing our outstanding revenue bonds. As a result, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and good access to the capital markets. In addition to our basic business refinancing activities we successfully established and syndicated a $1.05 billion bridge facility to support the proposed Nicor transaction that will be replaced with long-term debt financing prior to closing the acquisition. Interest expense for 2010 was up $8 million over the prior year, which was mainly a function of higher average debt balances, which were driven by the issuance of $300 million of long-term debt in August of 2009. Our capital expenditures for 2010 were up $34 million over the prior year, which primarily reflected the additional spending related Golden Triangle Storage facility, the Strive projects in Georgia and the utility infrastructure programs in New Jersey. Our base business utility spend was just slightly above our depreciation for the year and of the remaining CapEx nearly 55% was for regulatory infrastructure programs covered under riders where we accelerated recovery of the spend. For 2011 we expect to deploy about $440 million of capital and a slightly higher percentage of the total will be covered under rider based or similar programs. I’ll wrap up on Slide 11 with our 2011 guidance. Our diluted EPS guidance range for 2011 is $3.10-3.20 per share. And to be clear, this does not include Nicor transaction related costs and also excludes any post merger impact should we close some time in the second half of the year as expected. The assumptions underlying our guidance are listed here on the slide. Thanks for your time today and I’ll turn the call over to John. John Somerhalder Thank you Drew and good morning. First I’d like to reiterate that we achieved record earnings per share in 2010. This is quite an accomplishment and we have our dedicated employees to thank for these results. AGL Resources continues to be a leader among its LDC peers by many measures including safety, efficiency, low cost of service and stable financial results regardless of economic conditions. Turning to Slide 12 I will review some of our major operational accomplishments for last year and will then address our priorities for 2011 including an update on the Nicor merger before moving into the Q&A session. Safety is always the top priority at AGL Resources and we had an outstanding year from this perspective. For the fourth year in a row we were in the top quartile of the American Gas Association’s occupational safety ratings. During 2010 we also completed two rate cases, one at Atlanta Gas Light and one at Chattanooga Gas. The $27 million increase at Atlanta Gas Light marked the first rate increase for the business since 1993. The new rates have been in effect for about three months now and we’ll continue to see benefits in terms of both financial results and operational improvements for our customers. Utility rate cases are increasingly complex and require significant amounts of time and energy from our staff. We have one of the most responsive and experienced regulatory groups in the industry and the fair outcomes achieved in our rate cases are a direct reflection of their work. We also saw good results at both Salstar and Sequent as Drew mentioned. Let me go a little deeper on the industry fundamentals that are driving low gas price volatility and impacting our businesses as well as many of our industry peers. Production is at unprecedented levels primarily as a result of shale gas reserves that have been discovered across the US and advancements of technology to extract gas from these reserves. Though the EIA reports somewhat increased withdrawals over the last two weeks due to colder than normal temperatures, storage levels remain at relatively high historical levels for this type of year. If this combination of robust production and high storage inventories persist it likely means continued low volatility and lower margins in terms of optimizing our storage and pipeline assets. While these factors admittedly present some headwinds, there are also tailwinds on the horizon. The economy is improving, which should lead to increased customer demand particularly among commercial and industrial customers. The vast shale gas reserves mean that natural gas prices should stay low for the foreseeable future relative to coal and crude oil, making it more likely that power generation will rely increasingly on natural gas. When you factor in the environmental benefits of natural gas generation that likelihood is even greater. And we are starting to look at innovative uses for natural gas such as the LNG for transportation program we have announced in connection with El Paso. We’re still in the early stages but it’s a potentially exciting opportunity long term. At our storage business as most of you know, Cavern 1 at Golden Triangle began initial operations on schedule in September of last year and we’ve been serving a 2BCF contract. We successfully completed dewatering Cavern 1 prior to the end of the year and we are currently removing the gas that we use for the dewatering process. The facility is operating very well. The remaining four BCF of space in Cavern 1 will be available prior to April. This should work well for us from a timing standpoint with April marking the start of the injection season. Further, though prices for storage are lower than they were when we initiated construction on the project due to many of the supply and demand factors that we’ve discussed earlier, when combined with our existing 2BCF contract our all in blended rate will be higher than prevailing market rates. Turning to Slide 13 you’ll find our priorities for the year. Naturally, one of the top priorities will be closing the Nicor transaction and I’ll provide an update on that in just a moment. We’re often asked about our continuing views on M&A. This Nicor deal is transformational for AGL Resources, significantly increasing our scale and diversifying both our regulated and non-utility businesses. So we’ll remain focused on the important work of integrating our companies as we move forward in 2011. At the distribution business as always, safe, efficient operations is our number one priority. You’ll see that on our list year in and year out. We also filed a rate case at Virginia Natural Gas yesterday and will be working to complete that case later in the year. The main component of our filing is a requested increase of $25 billion with a mitigation plan to phase in the new rates over three years. Our request brings a portion of the Hampton Roads Crossing facility into rate base and also includes increases in base rates for maintenance and improvements of the distribution system. You may recall that we spent roughly $150 million to construct Hampton Roads and we have been allowed to capitalize the cost of carry. But we have not yet rolled VNG customer related portion into the rate base. Since we have been recognizing the cost of carry, the impact of the rate case is not expected to be material to our earnings. VNG customers have not seen an increase in their approved base rate since 1996. Given my earlier words on the natural gas environment, we’ll be looking to pursue responsible growth opportunities at our retail and wholesale businesses. And as I mentioned, we’ll be looking to contract more Cavern 1 at Golden Triangle as well as to continue the build out of Cavern 2, which is expected to be operational in 2012. Finally, and this is another one that you’ll always hear from the AGL Resources management team, we’ll be focused on controlling expenses and maintaining capital discipline in each of our business segments. Before closing I’ll give you a brief update on the Nicor transaction. AGL Resources and Nicor filed jointly for merger approval with the Illinois Commerce Commission on January 18, 2011 and we are seeking expedited approval by October 1, 2011. We also filed our S4 registration statement on Friday of last week. We will keep you posted on timing for our Hart-Scott-Rodino filing as well as shareholder meetings in the coming weeks and months. From an operational perspective we have already formed a transition team that is chaired by Drew with leadership from senior executives of both companies. The teams encompass all functions of the company and transition plans are well underway. We are pleased with our progress to date and remain on track for a second half close. Wrapping up our prepared remarks today, the natural gas industry is poised for growth as the economy recovers and as we turn more towards clean burning domestic fuels. With our distribution, retail, wholesale and storage assets, we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends. Beyond our existing business, 2011 is shaping up to be a transformational year for AGL Resources with the Nicor merger and our continued drive to remain an industry leader. Again I want to thank our employees for their dedicated and hard work as well as our shareholders and customers for your support of the company. Thanks for your time today and your interest in AGL Resources. Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
46,GV_001837_2011Q4,"Presentation Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Yearend 2011 AGL Resources Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shanell and I’ll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I’d now like to turn the conference over to the host for today, to Ms. Sarah Stashak, Director of Investor Relations. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Shanell. Thanks to everyone for joining us this morning to review our fourth quarter and year- end 2011 results. With me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; Andrew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team here to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-K for both AGL Resources and Nicor Gas are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements and projections and our actual results could differ materially from those forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and our 10-K. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of those measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our presentation, as well as on our website. Also you will note that we have modified our reporting segments to better reflect our operation post merger. We now have 5 operating segments. Distribution operations include the legacy AGL Resources utilities plus Nicor Gas. Retail operations include SouthStar plus Nicor’s Retail Energy and Services businesses. Wholesale operations include Sequent and Nicor Interchange. Midstream operations, includes our non-utility storage assets with the addition of Nicor Central Valley Gas Storage project and Cargo Shipping reflects the addition of Nicor’s Tropical Shipping units. Finally, for the segment called Other, which including our non-operating business units and corporate expenses. We will begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I’ll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks, Sarah and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3 of our presentation, we reported 2011 GAAP earning per share of $2.12 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, which excludes $64 million of after-tax costs incurred during fee related to the Nicor merger, earnings per share were $2.92 which compares to $3.05 in 2010. The decline in year-over-year earnings is largely driven by several factors impacting our Wholesale Services business, including lower natural gas price spreads, lower volatility and takeaway capacity constraints that affected us, particularly, in the third quarter. However, we saw strong performance in our utility business in 2011 resulting from new rate and infrastructure programs. Our results in total also reflect lower year-over-year incentive compensation due to not meeting our corporate earnings thresholds under our plans. Our 2011 GAAP results included 22 days of operations from Nicor as a result of our merger closing on December 9. We have detailed our results here, so you can see the standalone legacy AGL Resource businesses as well as the contribution from Nicor for those 22 days. Note that the Nicor EBIT loss of $90 million includes $34 million of change in control payments that were triggered when the merger closed. Also our weighted average share count increased to 80.9 million diluted shares for the year due to the merger. For 2012, our diluted EPS guidance range is $2.80 to $2.95 and we will discuss the assumptions underlying our guidance in a few minutes. Now let’s go to slide 4. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our diluted GAAP EPS was $0.37. On an adjusted basis excluding Nicor related expenses, it was $0.87 per share or $0.01 higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Again, you can see the break out of our legacy businesses separate from the Nicor contribution. On slide 5, you’ll find a reconciliation of annual 2011 EBIT to the initial segment guidance we’ve provided at our Analyst Meeting in May of last year. We included this slide to emphasize that the primary degradation earnings came from the Wholesale segment as we’ve discussed over the last several -- couple of quarters. Our performance at distribution operations was $38 million favorable to our guidance, but Wholesale was $48 million unfavorable to guidance. We did better than expected in the Midstream segment, but saw slight weakness at the retail segment relative to our expectations. I’d also note here that the higher interest expense we incurred relative to our expectations really reflects our pre-funding of the Nicor merger to various debt issuances throughout the year and the fees associated with the bridge facility. You can see the guidance range in our long-term EPS and dividend track record on slide 6 of the presentation. Our Board of Directors approved another 2% increase in our dividend earlier this month and our indicated annual dividend rate is now $1.84. At the mid-point of our 2012 guidance range, this would yield a payout ratio of approximately 64%. Moving on to slide 7, you’ll find a snapshot of EBIT by segment. On the top left, you can see our results across the business looking back to 2006 and underneath that chart is the quarterly look at EBIT, which gives you a good sense of the seasonality of the -- of our business. On the right you can see that our distribution business continues to be the largest operating segment contributor to EBIT representing approximately 79% of total operating EBIT contributions in 2011. This percentage is up significantly relative to prior years in large part to the reduced earnings contribution from Wholesale services. Retail operations accounted for 18%, Midstream operations for 2% and Wholesale services 1%. There were no material earnings contributions from the Cargo Shipping segment for the 22 days that we owned it in 2011. I’ll cover some of the major segment variances starting with our distribution business on slide 8. EBIT was up $60 million for the year or 17% compared to last year including an EBIT contribution of $15 million from the 22 days that Nicor Gas was included in our distribution results. The primary drivers of operating margin improvement were new rate and infrastructure programs at the legacy AGL Resources utilities and the addition of Nicor Gas in the fourth quarter. Operating expenses were up 5% year-over-year, due primarily to the addition of Nicor Gas offset by lower incentive compensation accruals. EBIT in the fourth quarter was slightly higher by -- was higher by 35% year-over-year with similar drivers to our full-year performance. You can see that our average customer count for the year for the legacy AGLR utilities was up slightly from 2010 and remains stable. The customer count at Nicor Gas was just under $2.2 million for 2011 also stable relative to 2010. Turning to the retail segment on slide 9, we recorded EBIT for 2011 of $93 million, a $10 million decline compared to 2010. Results were down in part due to weather that was 23% warmer than in 2010, resulting in lower customer usage. In addition, as gas prices declined during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a lower-of-cost or market, or LOCOM adjustment that was $5 million higher than in the prior- year. Operating expenses were lower by $5 million for the full-year due mainly to lower legal expense. You can see that the fourth quarter of 2011 results were also down year-over-year due primarily to the same factors I’ve just described. At the end of the year SouthStar’s market share was 33% in Georgia which equals our market share position at the end of both 2010 and 2009. So you can see that our customer count for 2001 declined slightly compared to the prior-year. You will find 2011 results for our Wholesale Services segment on slide 10. As expected Sequent continues to face the challenges of lower market volatility and lower price spreads for storage and transportation. This is reflected in our EBIT contribution of just $5 million for 2011, a decline of $44 million from 2010. The largest component of the EBIT decline came from $45 million reduction in commercial activity versus last year. Of this $45 million, $23 million was due to ongoing low volatility conditions and tight storage and transportation spreads. $18 million was related to the Marcellus takeaway issue that we detailed for you last quarter and $4 million was related to a customer bankruptcy which was also previously described. We anticipate remaining in a low volatility environment for the foreseeable future and we've made a number of changes to better adapt our business to this new operating environment. In addition to the impact of lower commercial activity during 2011, we had storage and transportation hedge gains that were $21 million higher than the prior-year, but we also recorded LOCOM in 2011 that was $24 million higher than in 2010 reflecting the decline in natural gas prices during the latter half of the year. Just to remind you, transportation storage hedge gains or losses and LOCOM are non-cash items, but impact the timing of reported income. Sequent enters 2012 with a $3 million rollout schedule which compares to a rollout schedule of $16 million at the same time last year. You will recall that the rollout schedule was at $6 million at the end of the third quarter in 2011 and 2010. The rollout schedule year-over-year is lower primarily due to lower seasonal spreads resulting from lower volatility associated with robust natural gas supply and ample storage as well as warmer weather versus the prior-year. Looking briefly at expenses for 2011 on our Wholesale business, they were down $5 million compared to the prior-year due mainly to a reduction in annual incentive compensation. Fourth quarter 2011 EBIT results for Wholesale were up $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 with primarily the same drivers as the full-year. Now let’s move to slide 11, EBIT in our Midstream operation segment improved by $3 million in 2011 compared to 2010. The improvement was due to increased revenue at Golden Triangle Storage, which we put into commercial operation in the third quarter of last year. For the fourth quarter of 2011, EBIT improved by $1 million mainly due to slightly higher operating margin. We've not included a slide here for our new Cargo Shipping segment as there was no material EBIT contribution from the segment for the 22 days that we owned the business since 2011. For the full-year the business was also breakeven on an EBIT basis. The downward trend in earnings at Cargo Shipping since 2007 coincides with the global economic recession, which has had significant impact on tourism in the overall economic conditions in the Caribbean region. In the past 2 years, the earnings decline in shipping has resulted from a combination of fewer TEUs or twenty-foot equivalent units being shipped and higher fuel costs that cannot always be easily passed along to customers. As with our Wholesale and Midstream businesses we do not anticipate a change in the market conditions in 2012, but we’ll be focused on controlling fixed-cost in the business and evaluating new customer opportunities. Some balance sheet highlights are noted on slide 12. Our balance sheet now includes full funding of a Nicor merger with our long term debt now $3.6 billion and short-term debt at $1.3 billion. As I noted earlier our interest expenses was up $27 million for 2011 as compared to 2010. That increase was mainly driven by the pre-funding for the cash portion of the Nicor merger as well as fees associated with the bridge facility we put in place when we announced the merger. On slide 12, I would also highlight our capital expenditures for 2011 and expectations for 2012. Utility CapEx including a full-year for Nicor Gas was $604 million in 2011. We anticipate spending about $725 million of utility CapEx in 2012, more than $300 million or over 40% of those expenditures are on writer base programs with minimal regulatory lag compared to about $200 million of writers related to spending in 2011. Our non-utility capital spending will be around $100 million primarily reflecting the build-out of the second cavern Golden Triangle Storage and the completion of Central Valley Gas storage projects, both of which we expect to be completed in the first half of this year. I won't go into detail on slide 13, but for reference you can see what our debt maturity schedule looks like following the merger closing. Relative to post merger size of our balance sheet we've no significant maturities until 2016 and even then at very manageable levels. Thanks for your time today, and I’ll now turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thanks, Drew and good morning. I’ll start by recapping what I believe was by most measures a solid year for the company in 2011. As Drew mentioned, we saw very strong performance in our utility business. And that is the result of a number of things we said in notion over the past couple of years on the regulatory front. To achieve reasonable rate outcomes and to pursue innovative programs such as our infrastructure investment programs where we deploy capital and see returns very quickly rather than waiting on traditional rate based adjustments. Our retail business continues to generate stable earnings results despite some of the competitive pressures we face, particularly in the Georgia market. In a year where we had significant financing needs related to the Nicor merger we benefited from historically low interest rates. So while we have interest expense that is higher year-over-year because of the merger, we were able to finance the transaction at levels far below what we -- what we would have expected in a more normal rate environment. We add to these successes the fact that we closed the Nicor merger, the most transformational event in the company’s long history and made substantial progress in the integration of our 2 companies. All of those things were positive for us in 2011 and set us up for well for achieving results in 2012. However, as we discussed with you on previous occasions, we clearly have challenges in certain of our businesses, which we saw on 2011, and we expect will continue in 2012. We have 3 non-utility businesses that face significant headwinds, our Wholesale Services business, our Natural Gas Storage business and the Cargo Shipping unit that we acquired as part of the Nicor merger. Each of these businesses operates in a market, or in markets where the fundamentals have changed dramatically over the past couple of years, and those fundamental shifts in the market and economic forces meaning those businesses have seen and will likely continue to see weaker results than we expected. Those weaker results impacted our earnings in 2011 and resulted in the revised guidance range we issued during the third quarter of the year. Unfortunately, market fundamentals have degraded even further in those businesses since our last call in October, as a result of mild weather, unseasonably high storage levels and other factors. These circumstances have impacted the guidance range we established for 2012 relative to our long-term plan. I do want to note that we still do the Nicor transaction as neutral to earnings for 2012 and accretive thereafter. Admittedly our forecast for the business has changed in response to market fundamentals. But the negative impacts are proportional across both AGL’s and Nicor’s legacy non-utility businesses. And importantly, at our regulated businesses, we continue to operate with a backdrop of fair rate case outcomes from recent years over 40% of regulated capital expenditures under writer programs, constructive regulatory relationships in all of our jurisdictions and the recent approval of Illinois Commerce Commission for this transformative merger. Turning to slide 14, as Drew mentioned, we expect to earn within the range of $2.80 to $2.95 per diluted share in 2012, excluding mark-to-market impacts and any additional Nicor merger-related costs. Our guidance assumes several factors that we achieved appropriate progress towards 2012 or during 2012 towards the run-rate efficiencies we expect from the Nicor merger, that we’ve no rate case activity in 2012 from our regulated utilities, that we experienced minimal growth in our retail businesses and that the challenging market conditions I described for our Wholesale, Midstream, and Cargo Shipping businesses persist throughout the year. Specifically our guidance includes achievement of anticipated efficiencies related to corporate overhead and non-utility businesses as a result of the Nicor merger, the persistence of a low natural gas price and volatility environment for the foreseeable future, pension expense for 2012 that is expected to be significantly higher than 2011 due to lower discount rates. This issue alone is expected to impact earnings by about $0.07 per share, increased expenses related to pipeline integrity and maintenance and an outstanding diluted share count of approximately 117.5 million reflecting the full effect of the shares we issued as part of the Nicor purchase price. We plan to provide greater detail related to these issues as well as segments specific guidance at our Analyst Day in March. From a regulatory perspective, as I mentioned, we have no pending rate cases and do not expect to file for new rate -- case rates in any our jurisdictions this year. However, we’ll be working to put new writer- based capital expenditure programs in place as well as to extend some of the existing programs. For example, earlier this year, we filed for a new pipeline replacement program in Virginia under the State’s Save Program. We’re proposing a 5-year modernization plan under which we plan to replace over 200 miles of aging pipeline. This would be a $100 million program aimed at enhancing the reliability and integrity of the natural gas distribution system in Virginia, while supporting the local economy by providing jobs. Our filing has been deemed complete and we expect to begin the program in August. We also are evaluating options to extend our existing program in New Jersey and may file with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities later this year. On the regulatory front, I also want to mention a recent development in the long running performance-based rates or PBR case in Illinois. Turning to slide 15, we’ve highlighted key aspects of the stipulation resolution that we reached with the Illinois Commerce Commission staff. Under this stipulation, Nicor Gas would credit $64 million to customers. The stipulation must still be approved by the ICC, and I would note that other parties in the case such as The Illinois Attorney General’s Office and The Citizens Utility Board have not signed on to the stipulation at this point. Some of the accounting impacts are listed here, but on the whole the settlement is consisted with what we have reserved for this issue. We anticipate a ruling from the ICC later this year, and we’ll keep you apprised of any substantial developments in the case. Turning to slide 16, you’ll find our priorities and objectives for 2012. In many ways, our objectives remain the same as they’ve over the past few years. For our utility businesses, we will continue to prudently invest in our operating infrastructure, so that we continue to provide safe and reliable systems to our customers at the lowest possible rates. For retail and Wholesale, we will focus on maintaining market share in our core service territories and expand into new markets. For storage, our primary goal is to bring our storage facilities online -- that the ones that are currently under construction and contract them at the best -- the combination of the best available rates and duration to optimize a portfolio in a very challenging market. At Cargo shipping, we will continue to focus on managing costs and maintaining a strong brand in the region and across all of our businesses we’ll focus on effectively controlling expenses. Importantly, in 2012 we will continue to build on the work we began in 2011 to integrate the legacy AGL Resources businesses with Nicor across each segment and to generate the efficiencies we‘ve discussed that are central to the success of the transaction. We’re excited to bring so many talented employees from Nicor into the AGL family and look forward to continuing strong tradition of safety, reliability and customer service that both companies have built for decades. On behalf of the employees of AGL Resources, we also welcome our new shareholders and we’d like to thank each of you for your continued interest in and support of our company. Operator, I’ll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."
47,GV_001837_2012Q4,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 AGL Resources Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carissa, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the presentation over to your host for today's conference, Ms. Sarah Stashak, Director, Investor Relations. Please proceed. Sarah M. Stashak Director of Investor Relations Thank you, Carissa. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning to review our fourth quarter and year end 2012 results. Joining me on the call today are John Somerhalder, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Drew Evans, our Executive Vice President and CFO. We also have several members of our management team available to answer your questions following our prepared remarks. Our earnings release, earnings presentation and our Form 10-K are available on our website. To access these materials, please visit aglresources.com. Let me remind you today that we will be making some forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve matters that are not historical facts, and our forward-looking statements and projections could differ materially from our actual results. The factors that could cause such material differences are included in our earnings release and more fully described in today's 10-K filing. We also describe our business using some non-GAAP measures, such as operating margin, EBIT, adjusted net income and adjusted EPS. A reconciliation of these measures to the GAAP financials is available in the appendix of our presentation as well as on our website. We'll begin the call with some prepared remarks before taking your questions. Drew, I'll turn it over to you to begin. Andrew William Evans Former Director Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our prepared remarks today with a recap of the 2012 results, and then John will address our expectations for 2013. Before detailing our results for the year, I want to address our earnings shortfall relative to the guidance that we initially provided for 2012, undoubtedly the warmest weather on record negatively impacted our 2012 performance. Fortunately, we do have weather normalization for several of our utilities and effectively hedged a significant portion of our weather risk in our retail operations. As a result, even with the historically warm weather, we had a negative impact of only about $32 million on an EBIT basis in our distribution operations and our retail operations businesses. In addition, while our Wholesale Service business generated higher economic value during the year, in part supported by its storage rollout schedule, mark-to-market accounting on our hedge positions resulted in a year-over-year negative impact to reported earnings. A majority of the economic value captured in 2012 is expected to be recognized in our accounting earnings in 2013. As you know, we expected to generate at least $60 million of savings across the enterprise following the close of the Nicor transaction. We were able to achieve our targeted savings primarily across our distribution, retail and Wholesale Services segment. However, revenues from the combined businesses were weaker than we anticipated across most of our operating segments in part due to market fundamentals that were weaker than we expected at the time of the merger announcement. Due to the 3 primary factors I just described, our EPS excluding nonrecurring items was $2.46 for the year, which is $0.42 lower than the midpoint of our initial guidance range. As a result, our incentive compensation expense for 2012 was lower than our target levels by approximately $29 million, which shielded our investors by approximately $0.15 per share. Now turning to Slide 3 of our presentation. You can see that we reported GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter of $0.84. On an adjusted basis, excluding $5 million of merger-related costs and additional $8 million accrual related to the Nicor Gas PBR issue, which I'll address momentarily, diluted earnings per share was $0.91, which compares to $0.94 on an unadjusted basis for the fourth quarter of 2011. The primary year-over-year driver of our fourth quarter earnings is the addition of the Nicor businesses. As a reminder, 2011 included only 22 days of contribution from Nicor following the close of the merger. Turning next to Slide 4. You can see our full year 2012 financial results. Diluted EPS adjusted for Nicor expenses was $2.46, down from $2.92 for 2011. The primary reason for the decline are the -- reasons for the decline are the impact of the unprecedented warmer than normal weather throughout much of the year, as well as mark-to-market hedge gains that were lower than 2011. A snapshot of fourth quarter and full year EBIT for our distribution business is on Slide 5. EBIT was up $31 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. This includes an EBIT contribution of $15 million from Nicor Gas. The primary driver of results for both the fourth quarter and the year were warmer than normal weather for our 2.2 million customers in Illinois. In 2012, the Chicago area had 19% fewer heating degree days than the 10-year average, and this weather impact reduced our EBIT in the distribution business by $24 million. While this certainly presents a challenge, I do want to point out that the rate structure in Illinois is such that a significant portion of our revenue is recovered through base rates, which partially mitigates our exposure to weather. As such, the negative weather impact represents only about 1.5% of the total operating margin for our distribution segment for 2012. While weather was a major driver in Illinois, the remainder of this segment performed well during 2012, posting an $11 million increase in EBIT compared to 2011, primarily due to effective expense management, achievement of merger-related cost savings and higher contribution from regulatory infrastructure programs. In this segment, we also recorded an additional $8 million or $0.04 liability related to the long-running performance-based rate or PBR case in Illinois. The administrative law judge issued a proposed order in November, which included a recommended amount that was $8 million higher than our settlement with the ITC staff, and we are awaiting a final ruling from the Illinois Commerce Commission. We increased our accrual for this issue by $8 million in the fourth quarter, though obviously, based on our agreement with the ITC staff, we disagree with the ALJ's position. Turning to operating expenses. The $557 million for O&M in 2012 includes higher than anticipated expenses related to compliance and integrity work, particularly in the second half of the year. Our customer count remains stable and reflects a slight increase year-to-year. Turning to the retail segment on Slide 6. We reported EBIT for the fourth quarter of $37 million, an $8 million increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase mainly reflects the addition of Nicor's retail businesses to our portfolio, as well as a reduction in transportation and gas costs and lower bad debt expense at SouthStar. Our SouthStar joint venture continued to perform well and maintained its market-leading position in Georgia while expanding into other markets when it can do so profitably. You may have seen the press release we issued last Thursday announcing our acquisition of NiSource's retail services business. This business provides home warranty solutions such as appliance repair and line protection services and complements the retail services business that we acquired as part of the Nicor acquisition. We view this as an opportunity to essentially double the size of that business and to gain scale on a cost-effective manner. We expect the transaction to add more than $7 million of EBIT to the retail services segment -- retail segment in 2013 after the merger-related expenses and amortizations of intangibles and will be accretive to EPS this year. We are working to quickly integrate these 2 businesses, and we look forward to sharing more with you about the outlook for retail services at our Analyst Day. You'll find fourth quarter 2012 results for our Wholesale Services segment on Slide 7. There are a few moving pieces affecting our year-over-year results, so let me take you through them. EBIT declined by $4 million year-over-year for the fourth quarter. As we noted in our January press release, we had mark-to- market losses of $22 million related to the transportation positions along the Northeast corridor. This was the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. For the full year, EBIT declined by $8 million due mainly to transportation and storage hedge gains that were lower in aggregate than in 2011, though commercial activity improved year-over-year. While hedge movements in our accounting results can sometimes mask the true economic value generated by the wholesale segment, I do want to highlight this increase in value during the quarter and throughout the year. We ended the year with a storage rollout schedule of $27 million, which you can see on Slide 8, and we expect to realize that value in operating revenues in 2013. This is a significant improvement over the $3 million rollout schedule at year end 2011. Taking into account our fourth quarter transportation hedge losses, as well as transportation hedge gains realized earlier in 2012, we have about $7 million of economic value related to transportation hedge positions that we expect to realize in 2013. Now let's move to Slide 9. EBIT at our midstream segment was $4 million during the fourth quarter of 2012, slightly higher than the prior year. For the full year, EBIT was $10 million, up $1 million over 2011. The increase for both the quarter and the year is due primarily to revenues from Central Valley, offset by lower revenues at Jefferson Island versus the prior year due to re-contracting at lower rates. You can see the blended rates for each storage facility on the chart at the bottom right side of this page. Overall, the market for storage remains weak, but we continue to focus on ways to optimize the value of our available capacity while not committing to long-term contracts in this low price environment. Briefly, you can see results for the Cargo Shipping segment on Slide 10. We reported EBIT of $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2012, and $8 million for the full year. Factors impacting this business have remained consistent throughout the year. Market share and utilization are slowly improving. And while volume is higher year-over-year, rate per 20-foot equivalent, or TEU, has fallen. We have worked with the management team at Tropical to maximize efficiencies in this business, and we are all focused on appropriately improving profitability per TEU. I would also note that of the $22 million of depreciation and amortization at the Cargo Shipping segment, EBIT is burdened by approximately $8 million of purchase accounting depreciation and amortizations. Book balance sheet highlights are noted on Slide 11. Our long-term debt was 33 -- $3.3 billion at the end of the year, which reflects the additional debt issued to finance the Nicor transaction and the additional Nicor debt we assumed when we closed the transaction. Interest expense was up $3 million for the quarter compared to same period in 2011, mainly driven by the recapitalization. For the full year, interest expense was $184 million, which compares favorably to our expectation of $193 million for the year. We do plan to issue some long-term debt later this year in part to refinance our $225 million April maturity, as well as to term-out of some of our current short-term debt balances. Turning to our capital expenditures. CapEx for the year was $784 million. We anticipated -- we anticipate spending about $650 million of utility CapEx in 2013. More than $200 million, or roughly 1/3 of those expenditures are on rider-based programs with minimal regulatory lag compared to about $270 million of rider-related spending in 2012. Our nonutility capital spending is expected to be around $40 million, about half of what it was in 2012, reflecting the wind-down of construction spending at our storage facilities. Thanks for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to John. John William Somerhalder Former Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Drew. First, I wanted to highlight some significant operational accomplishments for 2012, particularly in our Distribution Operations segment, where we continue to focus on being the leader in the sector with regard to pipeline safety, maintenance and upgrades. During the year, we replaced more than 280 miles of aging pipeline infrastructure across our footprint, continuing our strategy of deploying capital into regulated business in a way that minimizes regulatory lag and ensures timely recovery of and on our capital. We also achieved good success in extending our system and promoting the use of natural gas in several communities. We also managed an excellent recovery effort in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. On our system in New Jersey, we performed more than 8,000 meter assessments, and we replaced or restored nearly 1,500 meters systemwide. Further, we deployed nearly 60 employees for mutual aid to supporting -- support neighboring utilities in their restoration efforts. The proper maintenance and operation of our distribution system is paramount to the health of our company, so you will see us continue to invest in these areas. Operational accomplishments notwithstanding, I'll reiterate that we are disappointed in last year's financial results relative to our guidance and our initial guidance. While there were some factors beyond our control, such as weather and marks related to our wholesale positions, we were successful in achieving cost savings relative to the Nicor merger at our forecasted level of $60 million. However, as Drew mentioned, revenues from the combined businesses were weaker than we anticipated. We have a much clearer picture now that we've operated the combined businesses through a difficult year, and our 2013 guidance reflects both our expected opportunities and our challenges. Turning to Slide 12. You can see that our EPS range for 2013 is $2.50 per share to $2.70 per share for the consolidated the business. We also have provided the expected EBIT range for each segment as well as our estimated interest expense for the year. Due to the volatility of earnings from our wholesale business, we are introducing a more granular measure, earnings per share, excluding the Wholesale Services segment, which is $2.40 per share to $2.50 per share. This metric should allow you to better track our business performance as we progress through the year without quarterly volatility driven by mark-to- market accounting clouding our results. Our wholesale business continues to be extremely important in managing many of our utility assets and has returned more than $200 million under our Asset Management agreements over the last decade. However, we view the EPS measure, excluding wholesale, to be a better gauge of success for our remaining businesses, which have seasonally, but less -- they are seasonal but they have less volatility. Our wholesale business continues to be a low-risk energy marketing business focused on serving our utilities, third-party utilities, power generation and producers. Though this business is delivering lower earnings consistent with our expectations and low-volatility environment, it provides us an option on higher earnings under improving wholesale market conditions. Turning to Slide 13. You will find the assumptions underpinning our guidance. I won't go through each of these but note that we assume normal weather for the entire year, exclude mark-to-market impacts and expect continued low volatility in the price of natural gas. We also have provided the approximate quarterly earnings contribution that we expect from our distribution retail and shipping segments, so you can see the anticipated shape of our earnings distribution across the year. On Slide 14, you will find a bridge of our 2012 actual EBIT adjusted to exclude the merger cost and additional Nicor PBR litigation accrual to the midpoint of our 2013 EBIT estimate. As you can see, Distribution Operations is expected to be consistent year-over-year. There are quite a few items that are largely offsetting, and I will address those on the next slide. Retail is expected to be higher by roughly $15 million in part because of warmer weather in 2012 and reflecting our acquisition of NiSource's retail services business. Wholesale is expected to contribute approximately $30 million, driven by a strong storage rollout schedule in 2012 and the recruitment of losses association with transportation positions. Midstream is expected to be lower due to re-contracting at lower rates and higher depreciation expense associated with the startup of new facilities in 2012, and we expect an improvement out of our Cargo Shipping related to increased profitability per TEU. If you turn to Slide 15, I will take you through some of the moving parts impacting Distribution Operations. One of the biggest impacts year-to-year comes from the normalization for weather, which had the positive EBIT impact of $24 million versus 2012. Second, we expect our infrastructure investment programs to add approximately $30 million to 2012 levels. This reflects the programs we have in place in Georgia, Virginia and New Jersey. However, this increase is offset somewhat by additional systemwide depreciation expense of around $20 million. Looking at the main decrements, the one that clearly stands out is incentive compensation. As I mentioned, we did not meet incentive compensation criteria for 2012 from a cash or a stock perspective, and prior stock awards that included a performance measure were not granted due mainly to warm weather. Assuming a return to target levels in incentive compensation in 2013, that will lead to a year- over-year swing of roughly $27 million that takes us back to market median pay. To put this amount in perspective, this incentive compensation covers about 3,200 of our utility and corporate service employees. Lastly, pension and retirement benefits expense is up slightly due to declining discount rates as a result of further interest rate declines in the past year. As a reminder, pension and retirement benefit expenses increased $14 million from 2011 to 2012, and we expect an additional increase of about $6 million from 2012 to 2013. A further note on the pension front is that effective December 31, 2012, we have officially combined our 3 pension programs for Atlanta Gas Light, Nicor Gas and the former NUI utilities. Combining these plans will significantly reduce any required minimum funding contributions over the next several years. The merging of the plans was a significant undertaking, and we are pleased to have accomplished this one -- just one year into the merged operations. While we expect our EBIT results to be unchanged year-over-year at Distribution Operations, this does not reflect our strong cash generation. Cash flows generated by our operations were more than $1 billion in 2012, supporting our ongoing commitment to increase dividends, which you see on Slide 16. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase for 2013. Our dividend now stands at $1.88, a 2% increase over last year. Though our payout ratio has increased a bit relative to the peer group due to weaker earnings in 2012, again, we are generating strong cash flows to support the dividend. On Slide 17, you can see a summary of priorities for 2013. These are consistent with the business initiatives we had previously discussed with you, and we will review each of them in greater detail at our Analyst Day in New York on March 27. In closing, while our 2012 financial results were disappointing relative to our expectations, our core distribution and retail businesses are stable, healthy and continue to perform well. Combined, they contributed 97% of operating EBIT in 2012, and we expect approximately 95% of operating EBIT from these 2 segments in 2013. We recognize that we face significant challenges in our wholesale, midstream and shipping segments, and we'll continue to work to position these businesses for success as market fundamentals improve. We are very proud of the significant time and effort invested by our people across all of our businesses to accomplish key merger integration and operational milestones this past year, and I am confident that their efforts will result in long-term benefits for the combined company. We thank you for your time today and for your continued interest in AGL Resources. Operator, I'll turn the call back over to you to begin the Q&A session."

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in AMN Healthcare and in taking the time to participate in our earnings call. Overall, first quarter results are in line with the strategic course management has set for the company. We began the year with an aggressive and focused plan to drive near-term growth and to continue to make investments in our long-term strategy. As we finished the first four months of the year, I am pleased to report we have made important progress towards achieving our goals, both operational and financial. Through organic growth and the addition of Platinum Select, our revenues grew year-over-year across all business segments. We improved our consolidated gross profit margin and EBITDA margin over the prior year. Despite the sluggish economic environment, we continue to feel positive about the current and long- term growth opportunities in each of our service segments. In particular, we are most encouraged by the increased levels of demand for our travel nurse and allied professionals since the beginning of the year. Most of this demand pickup occurred during February and March, setting us up in a solid position as we enter the second quarter. Our consolidated revenues of $294 million for the first quarter came in at the top end of our guidance range, while earnings per share of $0.28 actually exceeded our guidance. During the first quarter, our nurse and allied staffing business revenues grew by 2% over last year. The year-over-year improvement was due to the partial quarter contribution from the addition of Platinum Select. Our organic growth was under prior year by 2%, driven primarily by a drop in the number of long-term international nurses on assignment and a decrease in radiology technicians. Our short term travel nurse revenues, excluding international, was flat with prior year and up just over 1% sequentially. Embedded in these numbers is a very positive trend in our nurse choice brand, which places nurses in urgent, quick start, short assignments. We experienced double digit year-over-year and sequential growth in this service offering. While this is a small piece of our business today, growth in these types of short-term urgent assignments is usually a sign of stronger future growth in the traditional travel nurse business. Pricing remained relatively strong, with an increase of 3% in revenue per traveler per day over prior year. Since the beginning of the year, demand has been strengthening across the country, with the best year- over-year growth in the western and central regions. In particular, the greatest demand growth came in some of our key states, such as California, Arizona and Texas. The eastern region also had some pockets of growth. But some states, in particular Florida, continue to be challenging. Some of the external factors helping drive the positive demand trends seemed to be a slight lift in hospital admissions, the onset of a late flu season, the opening of new units, and the wearing effects of hospitals who may have been too tightly staffed during the last year. But we have also made some internal changes that have helped us drive this demand increase and convert more orders into placements. We have reorganized certain facets of our sales teams, we have ramped up our internal recruiting and training efforts, and we have become more aggressive in our approach to VMS relationships. The results are encouraging, with the number of new facility contracts exceeding our expectations, the number of preferred relationships rising and the aggregate number of orders up significantly since the beginning of the year. We have been able to convert this increase in demand into greater placements for future assignments. Year-to-date placement volume in our short-term nursing division is above prior year levels. Turning to our international division, we remain optimistic that the continued impact of a bottleneck immigration environment will be resolved. Foreign educated nurses are a very significant source of staffing for healthcare facilities nationwide. While we are not anticipating a solution in 2008 in our guidance estimates, we are encouraged by some recent Congressional action. On April 29th, the Emergency Nurse Supply Relief Act was introduced. As we've mentioned on prior calls, we have maintained a small but critical infrastructure team in order to manage our pipeline of nurses who are in a waiting pattern to come to the US. While allied healthcare staffing is still a relatively small piece of our overall business, it is becoming a larger percentage of our nurse and allied service line, and is one of the faster growing markets within the industry. Within our allied business, we have seen very strong growth in the demand and placement of therapy specialties. Offsetting this a bit is a contraction in the demand for radiology technicians, which has been felt across the industry. While we intend to continue to provide professionals in both disciplines, we have been reallocating resources to put more emphasis on the faster growth specialties within therapy. To further bolster our strength in the therapy specialties, we completed our acquisition of Platinum Select on February 15. Platinum Select has an excellent brand reputation in the allied industry and a very entrepreneurial team. Today, the integration process and response to the acquisition has been very positive and Platinum is on track with their growth expectations for the year. Every year, we seek to expand our business model into new healthcare disciplines and market channels within each of our business segments. During the quarter, we expanded our allied service offering with the launch of a permanent placement service for therapy specialties, and the addition of recruitment and placement of clinical laboratory technicians for short-term travel. Moving now to our locum tenens staffing business. Revenue increased 7% in the first quarter compared to last year. There were several bright spots within locum where growth continued on a double digit track. But overall, we were pulled back to single digit growth due to a couple of weaker divisions. In aggregate, our volume, which we measure as days filled for the quarter, was slightly higher with a 1% increase over last year and 2% over last quarter. Primary care, our largest division, continued to experience solid sequential and year-over-year growth. However, after experiencing 28% revenue growth in radiology in 2007, the current demand in pricing for radiology locums is now being impacted by the lagging effect of lower reimbursement rates paid to imaging centers. From the information we are hearing from clients, the volume of imaging reads has not slowed. But the willingness of nonhospital-based imaging centers to use outside labor to manage the work load has tightened. In addition, our anesthesia and surgery divisions were impacted by lower inpatient and outpatient surgery volumes during the first quarter. The effects of this decline were more pronounced in our western region. We do believe that there is opportunity to improve performance through better internal execution in these divisions. And we are already on a better track, with volumes expected to grow moderately in the second quarter and throughout the remainder of the year. As we look forward to the second quarter, we are expecting double digit revenue growth sequentially, with particular strengths in primary care and behavioral health. Progress in our expansion into new emerging specialties for locum has been positive. These specialties include orthopedic surgery, dentistry and hospitalists. While still a small percentage of our business, we experienced growth in excess of 30% year- over-year. This year, we have added resources to build dedicated teams to maximize these opportunities long term. These are the types of seeds we like to plant every year to nurture opportunities for new revenue sources in the future. We believe there continues to be an overall healthy environment for growth in the locums industry and our full year and long-term outlook has not changed. Turning to physician permanent placement. This business generated revenue growth of 6% year-over- year. While the revenue growth was modest, at single digits, it was in line with our expectations. And more importantly, the drivers of future growth were in line with our expectations. The number of new contracts increased 6% sequentially, which will help drive future revenue from search and placement activities. The greatest percentage growth in new searches was experienced in the specialties of internal medicine and OB-GYN. Our highest demand specialties continue to be in family practice and internal medicine. Although our smallest segment in terms of revenue, physician permanent placement, continues to be our most profitable, with EBITDA margins for the quarter running at approximately 25%. Every week, you will likely see a national report or an article acknowledging the continued struggles fueling the physician shortage. For example, last week there was an article on the front page of the Wall Street Journal describing a cultural shift taking place in US medicine, in which younger physicians are more frequently seeking to balance work and family life. This is just one of the factors that continues to impact the shortage of physicians and even more so the reasons for an expected deepening of the physician shortage for years to come. As the national leader in the placement of permanent and temporary physicians, we believe we are well positioned to help the healthcare community to contend with these difficulties. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Dreyer. David? David Dreyer Well, thank you, Susan and good afternoon. We reported revenue of $294 million for the first quarter, which was 3% higher than both the first quarter of last year and the previous quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.28, as compared to $0.23 for the same quarter last yea and $0.26 for the prior quarter. Revenue generated by our nurse and allied staffing segment this quarter was $204 million, compared to $200 million last year and $197 million last quarter. These increases were driven primarily by a 3% and 1% increase in revenue per traveler per day, as compared to the first and fourth quarters of 2007 respectively. Average travelers on assignment decreased by 2%, compared to the first quarter of 2007, but increased 4% compared to last quarter. The sequential increase was due mostly to the addition of Platinum Select on February 15. Excluding Platinum Select, the nurse and allied segment traveler account was flat with last quarter's volume, reflecting continued reductions in our international traveler account from retrogression, offsetting growth realized in our short-term nurse division. The lower year-over-year traveler count is reflective of both the decline in international travelers and the lower demand for nurses during the second half of 2007. However, recent volume trends suggest that in the second quarter, our organic nurse and allied volumes should begin resuming back to sequential growth despite a continued decline in international traveler account. We also expect to achieve year-over-year quarterly volume growth during the second half of 2008. Revenue generated by our locum tenens staffing segment this quarter was $76 million, an increase of 7% compared to last year and relatively flat to last quarter. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due to a 1% increase in days filled, combined with a 6% increase in revenue per day filled. Revenue for our physician permanent placement segment this quarter was $13 million, which was 6% higher than last year and just over 1% higher than last quarter. Looking forward, increases in the number of producing sales team members and new searches are expected to result in more meaningful revenue growth in the second quarter and full year 2008. Consolidated gross profit this quarter was $77 million, representing a gross margin of 26.4%, compared to 25.5% reported last year and 26.6% reported last quarter. The year-over-year increase in gross margin of 90 basis points was due primarily to an improved pay-to-bill spread in the nurse and allied and locum tenens staffing segments. Compared to last quarter, gross margin declined slightly due in part to having one less billing day. This was partially offset by lower provider compensation in the locum tenens staffing segment where gross margin increased by 60 basis points sequentially. On a segment basis, gross margins for the first quarter were 24.0% for nurse and allied, 26.7% for locum tenens and 61.6% for physician permanent placement. SG&A expenses this quarter were $55 million or 18.8% of revenue, which compared to 18.7% last year and 19.6% last quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent with the first quarter of last year but decreased 80 basis points compared to last quarter. This decrease, compared to last quarter, was due primarily to favorable insurance experience within the nurse and allied segment during the quarter and a $700,000 restructuring charge recorded last quarter related to our international division. Net interest expense this quarter was $2.8 million, down from $3.3 million last year and about the same as last quarter. The decrease compared to last year was due to continued reductions in our debt outstanding. The effective income tax rate this quarter was 41.2%, as compared to 35.3% reported last quarter and slightly higher than the 40% effective rate we previously guided for 2008. As discussed on the last call, there were a number of favorable adjustments made in the fourth quarter as we finalized the full year federal and state tax provisions. For 2008 we are now anticipating a full year effective tax rate of approximately 41%, which mostly reflects the impact of our recent acquisition of Platinum Select. We had an average of 34.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding during the first quarter. As we announced earlier today, we are planning a share repurchase program of up to $38 million, which we expect to be substantially completed by the end of 2008. As the actual number of shares to be acquired and the timing of these repurchases is dependent on our available operating cash flow, it's uncertain what the actual accretion will be in 2008. However, we estimate that there may be up to $0.01 to $0.02 benefit to 2008 earnings. After completion of the repurchase program, we estimate that the resulting lower share count will provide annualized accretion of at least $0.08 per share. Turning to our financial position. This quarter we generated $17 million in operating cash flow, which, in addition to cash on hand and use of our revolver was used to fund the acquisition of Platinum Select. As a result, total debt outstanding as March 31, 2008 was $146 million. The resulting first quarter leverage ratio is 1.5 times. DSO at the end of this quarter, excluding the acquisition of Platinum Select, was 60 days, compared to 59 days last year and unchanged from last quarter. The one day increase in DSO compared to last year reflects mainly the higher proportion of revenue earned during the month of March, as compared to the first two months of the quarter. Now, I'd like to provide you with our revenue and earnings guidance for the second quarter and full year 2008. Our 2008 guidance, given last March, already included Platinum Select estimates. While we are not planning on separately reporting on Platinum Select, given its relative size, we are reporting this quarter only that it contributed approximately $7 million of revenue in the first quarter and is expected to generate approximately $15 million of revenue in the second quarter. We expect Platinum Select to contribute to AMN's earnings mostly in the second half of 2008. Second quarter revenue is expected to range from $313 million to $316 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.26 to $0.28. As we noted earlier, our first quarter earnings per share included approximately $0.02 from favorable insurance experience, which we expect to normalize going forward. We reaffirm our full year guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $1.16 to $1.22. As in the past, we expect to have better visibility on our projected growth during the second half of the year when we report our second quarter results. We look forward to updating you on our outlook at that time. Su? Susan Nowakowski Thanks, David. Before taking your questions, we would like to reiterate that the shortage of healthcare professionals remains all too real. The gap continues to grow. It affects the ability of healthcare providers to deliver quality care. It affects the clinicians themselves and ultimately it affects patients. We are confident that AMN, as the industry leader, will continue demonstrating the strategic and operational ability to deliver greater client value in what is truly an ever-changing and demanding environment. And with that, we would like to now open up the call to your questions."
49,GV_144520_2009Q1,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AMN Healthcare First Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] With that, I would now like to introduce your opening speaker for today, Chris Powell. Please go ahead. Christopher Powell Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the AMN Healthcare Services Conference Call to discuss the company's earning results for the first quarter of 2009. For the call this afternoon we have Susan Nowakowski, AMN's President, and Chief Executive Officer; and David Dreyer, AMN's Chief Financial Officer. A replay of this webcast is available at and will be available until May 21, 2009. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and our current reports on Form 8-K which have been filed and publicly available from the SEC. The results reported on this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. The relative strength of our diversified client base and our consistent focus on quality is becoming even more evident in this tight market environment. We've been able to grow our market share over the prior year, and at the same time continue to proactively maintain investments in our future to support our new service lines. Our ability to remain agile and execute well in the short term while maintaining a focus on our long-term strategy will enable us to emerge from this economic cycle better positioned to further expand our leadership position in the industry. Short-term demand trends do remain challenging as the economic environment has temporarily reduced nurse attrition and expanded the available supply of hours from previously retired or part-time clinicians. Similar to the trends we saw in the previous economic downturn, nurses who had left the work force are now returning and nurses who were working part-time are now willing to work full-time. This is consistent with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting that healthcare job openings and quits are down over prior year by about 25%. Many healthcare facilities are reporting admissions below prior year levels and even where admissions are relatively stable, the available dollars to adequately staff facilities is limited. According to a recent AHA survey of hospital CEOs, over half of hospitals have been experiencing lower levels of in-patient admissions and elective procedures. This is consistent with an April Kaiser Family Foundation survey which cited that nearly 60% of Americans say that they, or a family member, has taken steps to delay healthcare for cost reasons over the past year. Despite the short-term squeeze however, the long term fundamentals that drive our industry have not changed. In fact, future demand for nurses and physicians could grow at a faster rate than previously expected if healthcare reform achieved one of its primary goals of increasing access for more of the population. The timing and impact of healthcare reform are uncertain, but in nearly any scenario they are likely to increase the demand for quality clinicians. In the short term however, demand for temporary clinical staff continues to be down or at very modest growth rates for most disciplines. As a result, during the first quarter we experienced a decline in consolidated revenues of 15% over last year. The biggest contributor was volume declines in the Nurse and Allied segment which experienced a 20% year-over-year revenue drop. While we are certainly not happy with these numbers, we do believe that the strength of our model and the superior execution of our team have allowed us to capture market share over the prior year. At the current low demand levels, we may see companies gain or lose a little market share from quarter to quarter. We think it's prudent to look at market share position over a longer period of time and it is clear that over the last year, the last five years, and 10 years AMN has gained market share and increased our leading position in the industry. One of our greatest strengths is how we perform in a market rebound. If you look at the last two market contractions where you might have seen quarterly fluctuations in market share, most companies ended up with comparable overall volume contraction by the end of the cycle. A big difference however, is how AMN performed as the markets improved. We have historically lagged our competitors in experiencing the decline and as the market stabilizes and returns, we have picked up volume and share more quickly, resulting and greater longer-term market gain. We are finding that as our clients reduce the number of staffing companies they use, they are more and more interested in retaining AMN as their lead provider. This is a time when our size, and our 25 year history of consistent focus on quality and service are rewarded by our clients. As a result, we have seen a significant increase in our preferred client relationships, where we receive the lead time on our orders. The pricing environment remains relatively stable in nursing with average revenue per traveler per day 2% higher than prior year. Despite lower demand levels and some pricing pressure with certain clients, we continue to achieve pricing increases resulting in a consistent overall average bill rate. We have also been successful in maintaining and growing our physician as a preferred provider with clinicians. When demand is low, our ability to offer the largest selection of assignments to nurse candidates continues to be a differentiator in the market. Our estimates indicate that we now have over twice the number of assignments to offer than our closest competitor, and nearly 10 times more jobs than some of the second-tier companies. While nursing rebook rates sell at the beginning of the year in line with the lower demand, we have seen more stability over the past few months and although the overall new supply of candidates is down, we have seen a noticeable increase in the percentage of applicants that are coming from competitors, which is probably an indication of the lack of assignment selection amongst the smaller firms. Over the past two months, we have seen some stabilization in nursing order levels but it is still too early to tell whether we are in near an inflection point. One of the potential catalysts for an inflection point in demand would be the healthcare reform portion of the economic stimulus package and federal budget. There have already been some positive impacts to hospitals reported, as the stimulus provided stabilization to state and Medicaid programs and increased access to healthcare through COBRA subsidies. However the economy and general unemployment continue to be the most significant factors that would spur hospital admissions and create different work patterns amongst permanent staff. Within our Allied division we are seeing noticeable improvement in the demand for rehab therapy specialties and we expect to see this portion of the business grow throughout the year. Unfortunately, demand within the imaging specialties continues to be weak, slowing down the overall performance of the group. As therapy continues to grow, imaging is becoming a smaller part of the Allied business and its impact should lessen over time. Overall, we expect stabilization in Allied revenues during the second quarter, which is a very good sign. We continue to lead the Locum Tenens industry with first quarter revenues of 75 million which is a 2% decrease compared with prior year and prior quarter. Our results were a combination of strong double-digit growth in behavioral health and dentistry, as well as our largest specialty of primary care. This growth was offset by declines in radiology, surgery and anesthesia. We believe that surgery and anesthesia declines are more short-term in nature, whereas the radiology environment will likely remain at lower demand levels until reimbursement rates were adjusted. Although pricing was up in most specialties, revenue per day filled was down 1.5% year-over-year primarily due to mixed shift away from our highest bill rate group of radiology. Overall our days filled volume was relatively flat for the quarter. While the physician market has not been nearly as impacted by the economy as a nursing market it has not been immune to it either. Our overall days available which is a leading indicator of demand, trended downward in the first quarter; however, we are seeing signs of demand stabilization and growth in some areas going into the second quarter. All of our Locum specialties experienced improved fill rates, and we believe there is an opportunity to continue improving our execution and increasing our fill rates to grow revenues across all of our specialties. In addition to focusing on daily execution, we are also dedicating resources to areas that will fuel our future growth. To expand our physician market opportunity, we have made the decision to re-enter the emergency medicine staffing market for Locum Tenens. About five years ago, staff care exited the emergency medicine market due to concerns around malpractice exposure. We recently re-examined the claims evidence in this market and found our exposure risk to be less than previously thought and an acceptable economic model for our clients and our shareholders. We believe the emergency medical Locums market is roughly $350 million and could represent a 30 to $50 million revenue opportunity for AMN. In addition, re-entering the emergency medicine market will enable us to quickly leverage the relationships we already have across the nation and build market share quickly in this growing area. In Physician Permanent Placement, first quarter revenues were 11 million which is 17% below prior year. The decline was driven primarily by lower new retained search activity. However, placement volume also decreased by 5% year over year. While hospitals and practice groups still remain very focused on hiring physicians, we believe it has become temporarily easier for them to facilitate their own direct recruitment efforts or turn to less expensive and less predictable contingency search firms. In response to the market environment, we have redirected our internal resources from supply recruiting activities, towards demand generating sales functions. In some cases, we have also adjusted our pricing structure to remain competitive in the market place. Across all business lines, we continue to deal with the short-term economic pressures and are proactively adjusting our infrastructure. While some of the cost reductions we have made are directly related to the short-term volume trends, many of the changes are permanent and strategic in nature and will have a positive long-term impact on our business model and leverage. We discussed several of these cost savings and brand consolidation initiatives in our previous earnings call and have made significant progress in implementing them. Through a combination of natural attrition and employee reduction, our corporate staff levels decreased approximately 15% during the first quarter. Most of these reductions have been within our Nurse and Allied Staffing divisions and within our corporate support functions. Also, by reducing work schedules, we have been able to preserve our employee talent pool so that we can quickly flex back upward once the market reaches an inflection point. In balancing the short term with the future, we have been deliberate in continuing to support initiatives that further diversify our product lines and broaden our client base in order to position ourselves for long term growth and expansion. In addition to launching our Emergency Medicine division, we continue to nurture the new service offerings launched last year, such as recruitment process outsourcing and staffing services in the home health market and ambulatory surgery centers. We have already seen some internal synergies from these services as we've been able to re-book some of our travel nurses into jobs with our RPO business. At this point, I would like to turn the call over to David Dreyer, our CFO, who will give more detail on our first quarter results. David? David C. Dreyer Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Susan and good afternoon. Total revenue for the quarter was 250 million, a decline of 15% from the first quarter of 2008, and in line with what we guided last quarter given the current challenging environment. This decline was driven primarily by lower volume in our Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segments. Gross margin in the first quarter came in at 25.6% versus 26.4% in the prior year, and 25.7% last quarter. The decline from last year was due primarily to a mixed shift of lower gross profit contribution from our higher margin International Nursing business and narrower margins in the Travel Nursing business. We have made adjustments to improve pay bill spreads, and we expect to hold down payroll cost as well as housing and other travel-related expenses. Gross margins have generally held compared to the prior quarter levels, and are expected to remain consistent. We have not experienced significant pricing pressure and direct costs are generally trending favorably. SG&A expenses of 50 million were 9% lower than prior year. The decrease included reductions in third- party vendor and employee and other related costs and will provide further benefits throughout 2009 and beyond. On a sequential basis, SG&A expenses were down 9%, driven primarily by lower employee expense. These reductions in SG&A expenses demonstrate management's ability to quickly and effectively implement cost reduction measures in response to expected lower revenue and volumes, while increasing efficiency, and creating a more streamlined organization. Included in the first quarter SG&A expenses were approximately 900,000 in nonrecurring legal expenses to resolve a shareholder dispute. Excluding these nonrecurring expenses, first quarter SG&A was 6 million or 11% lower than prior quarter. For the second quarter we expect SG&A to decline at a similar rate in the low to mid teens. As a result of the cost reduction actions, we recorded a restructuring charge of 2.9 million in the first quarter, of which approximately 2.5 million was related to severance. The balance of the cost relates to leases. These actions will not affect our ability to continue supporting key initiatives that diversify our product lines and broaden our client base, nor to expand for future long term growth. The company expects to record restructuring costs of approximately 2.8 million in the second quarter, related to additional headcount reductions and lease expenses. During the first quarter, the company also reported non-cash impairment charges of 176 million. Approximately 141 million was related to goodwill impairment in the Nurse and Allied Healthcare Staffing segment, while 32 million was related to goodwill impairment in the Locum Tenens segment. We also recorded an impairment charge of $3 million in the Nurse and Allied segment related to trade names and trademarks. These impairment charges resulted from a combination of continued decrease in the company's market value and lower projected growth rates which reflected the decline in Nurse and Allied orders that began late in 2008 and then rapidly deteriorated during the first quarter of 2009. The company's affected tax rate for the quarter was 28.5%, as compared to 46.1% last year. Excluding the tax impact of the impairment charges, the full-year tax rate is estimated to be in the mid 50% range. This rate differs from the statutory rate due to the company having permanent differences which are not deductible for tax purposes. The company recorded a net loss of 122 million, or a -$3.74 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impairment, restructuring charges and nonrecurring legal expenses, the company's net income was 3.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, a hallmark of our differentiated business model. During the first quarter, we generated 38 million of operating cash flow which was used primarily to pay down the revolving credit facility. DSO improved by three days to 54 days and the company continues to focus on its collection efforts to drive strong cash flow. We ended the quarter with 120 million of debt outstanding and a leverage ratio of 1.3 times and improvement compared to 1.5 times a year ago. We are well within compliance with our debt covenants, the leverage and the fixed charge coverage ratios. In order to provide more operating flexibility, especially given the current economic uncertainty, we have finalized an agreement with our lending group to amend key covenants and extend the term of our existing revolving credit. The amendment increases the leverage ratio from two times up to three times through the first quarter of 2010 and then rateably goes back down two times by the end of the agreement in November 2011. The amendment also extends the term of our revolver by 12 months, making it coterminous with the term loan and modifies the interest rate on the revolver by 200 basis points up to LIBOR plus 350. We are pleased that the interest rate on the term debt remains unchanged at LIBOR plus 175 basis points. Now turning to our business segments, revenue in the Nurse and Allied segment was 164 million for the quarter, reflecting a 20% decrease from the prior year and a 21% decrease sequentially. Travelers on assignment averaged 5,489 this quarter, also down 20% versus the same quarter last year and sequentially. Gross margin at 23% was down 100 basis points from last year and down 60 basis points from last quarter as we experienced higher than normal health insurance costs in the first quarter which we expect to return back to historical levels in the second quarter and going forward. The adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment was 6.5% for the quarter, down 110 basis points from last year due primarily to lower margins. Compared to last quarter, adjusted EBITDA margin was down 40 basis points. Revenue in the Locum Tenens segment this quarter was 75 million, a 2% decrease from last year and last quarter. The decline was due mainly to lower average revenue-per-day filled from a mixed shift away from specialties like radiology and surgery which typically have the highest daily bill rates. Gross margin for the quarter was 26.2% down 50 basis points compared to last year, but up 20 basis points versus prior quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.6% was down 180 basis points from last year due mainly to the lower margin. Compared to last quarter, EBITDA margin was down 230 basis points due mostly to a combination of higher insurance and bad debt cost. Revenue for the Physician Permanent Placement segment was 11 million, down 17% from last year and down 10% from last quarter. These decreases were driven mostly by declines in new search levels and lower average billing rates. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27.9%, up 270 basis points compared to the prior year and up 420 basis points from last quarter driven by increased recognition to deferred revenue from prior period placements and lower SG&A spending. I will now return the call back to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, David. As I hope you have heard from our comments today, we remain very focused on building our revenue opportunities and expanding our market share for the long term, while also being disciplined in adjusting the company's infrastructure in line with the short term market conditions. Going into the second quarter, nursing order levels have begun to stabilize. However because of the lag time between receiving an order and starting an assignment, we anticipate that travel-nurse volumes will be down double-digits sequentially in the second quarter. Allied orders have begun experiencing an upward trend for the past two months and we anticipate allied volume to be flat or slightly up on a sequential basis. In Locum Tenens, we anticipate second quarter aggregate volumes will be up slightly on a sequential basis. Pricing continues to be stable across most of our business lines, helping to maintain or improve gross margins. On a consolidated basis, we are anticipating second quarter revenue to decline by approximately 20% on a sequential basis. Driven primarily by volume declines in nursing. We remain very focused on three key aspects of our strategy. First, continuing to deliver our superior levels of quality and service and building on our client base and breadth of offerings. Second, proactively adjusting our cost structure and capturing additional productivity gains in a way that will allow us to flex upward when the market returns. And finally, pursuing further penetration in emerging market opportunities in client segments. And with that, we would now like to open up the call for questions."
50,GV_144520_2010Q1,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AMN Healthcare First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Amy Chang, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amy Chang Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to AMN Healthcare's first quarter 2010 earnings call. A replay of this webcast is available at amnhealthcare.com/investors and will be available until May 20, 2010. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statement that refers to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current belief and are based upon information currently available to it. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Amy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AMN Healthcare's 2010 first quarter earnings conference call. I'll kick off the call first with a discussion on our business trends and some of the first quarter sales and operational highlights. And then, Bary Bailey, our CFO, will join in to share some financial detail. Before we go to Q&A, we will also provide an outlook for the second quarter. Overall, our first quarter results were representative of the stabilization being experienced across the healthcare staffing industry, as well as the improved operational and sales execution of our team. The significant efforts we undertook to restructure and streamline our operations and build stronger client relationships in 2009 are paying off and are evident in our profitability and margins. Earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.02, which was above our expectations. First quarter consolidated revenue was $143 million, which was relatively flat on a sequential basis. This quarterly stability marks an important inflection point for us in the economic cycle. The performance was driven by an increase in our Nurse Staffing business and offset by sequential decreases in our other business lines. The market is still very tight and continues to be constricted by high general unemployment and stagnant patient-admission levels. It remains unclear when these factors will change enough to move us off these artificially low demand levels. There is no doubt in my mind that as the economy returns to more normal level of general unemployment, we will begin to see the gap between demand and supply of clinical labor widened significantly. Leering on the accelerating aging population and the potential effect of health care reform, we should experience a dynamic that would be very favorable to our industry, but predicting the timing of such a confluence of events is difficult. In the meantime, we will remain lean to deliver solid operating profits at these lower-volume levels and ensure that we are taking necessary steps to be prepared for the opportunities for the future. So let's talk about the current environment. In the first quarter, the Nurse and Allied business generated $75 million in revenues, which was up 2% sequentially. Our Nurse business saw a sequential volume increase of 8%. The improvement was a result of higher order levels during the first part of the fourth quarter and continued improvements in our fill rates and retention rates. These improvements are most evident and have the greatest impact with our preferred and VMS [vendor management services] clients. While demand for nurse travelers continues to be higher on a year-over-year basis, the orders are still at very low historic levels. Despite the constricted environment, our nurses on assignment are working more hours per day. We also saw a notable pickup in our quick start, shorter assignment business called NurseChoice. These are typically positive early indicators. Pricing remained relatively steady with average nursing bill rates flat on a sequential basis and down about 1% from last year. In the first quarter, our Allied business experienced a sequential volume decline which came from both internal and external issues. The imaging portion of the Allied market remains soft and at historically low levels. Demand for rehab therapists remains strong, but the availability of the supply of clinicians is limited. The internal issues I mentioned arose from significant restructuring we did in 2009, creating a temporary disruption in the business and the productivity of our teams. The vast majority of these changes were completed in the fourth quarter, and we believe we will soon begin to see the benefits. Our Locum Tenens segment delivered first quarter revenues of $60 million, which is 3% lower than last quarter. On a sequential basis, we saw a volume stabilization in the first quarter with overall days filled being relatively flat. There was a continue decline in Radiology but this was offset by increases in the other specialties. With volumes flat, the 3% lower sequential revenue was due primarily to a mix shift to lower bill rates sub-specialties in Radiology and Surgery. A positive indicator was days sold, which were higher on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Going into the second quarter, we anticipate continued stabilization and improvement in the Locum Tenens trend. In Physician Permanent Placement, first quarter revenues were $8 million, which is 7% below prior quarter. Although we experienced slightly higher sequential placements, the drop in revenues over prior quarter was due primarily to a decrease in the billable hours and direct marketing. While aggregate new searches have gone up in the last six months, the growth in active searches had lagged because we have been experiencing a greater number of multi-search arrangements. These larger search opportunities provide excellent long-term revenue opportunity, however, they take longer to fully convert as these clients often prefer to stage the recruitment and hiring process. To maximize fill rates with our active searches, we are continuing to increase our recruiter headcount. As I mentioned in our last call, it will take a couple of quarters before we see a meaningful impact on placements from these new recruitment hires. From an operational perspective, we are poised to leverage our infrastructure and productivity capacity as the market rebounds. Our systems and teams are more agile, and we believe we can absorb additional volumes without adding commensurate SG&A. Over the past year, our team has worked proactively to manage to the severity of the market dynamics. We are working more cohesively than ever before, and with our recent re-branding effort, we are presenting ourselves externally and connecting internally as a more unified organization. I know that might sound trite, but it is very real and meaningful to our teams because they are seeing the results everyday. Despite the distractions of the past year, the team took a very balanced approach of managing the business to the short-term dynamics while still remaining focused on our long-term strategic plan. We believe this approach will begin to pay off this year and into the future. We've been focused around four key strategic areas. First, our efforts to remain close to the customer, to streamline and evolve our brands and win new preferred provider and managed-services contracts. These initiatives are already evident in our results and will give us even more upside opportunity as we emerge into a more robust recovery mode. Second, the ongoing investments in new service lines we have made over the last two years have set us up for stronger growth and more diversified revenue streams in the long term. Third, our efforts to streamline and consolidate our operational and cost infrastructure, not only improve our operating leverage, but have created a more agile organization to support product development and other growth initiatives. And fourth, our efforts to preserve the financial health of our balance sheet through close management of our profitability and debt restructuring position us very well to actively evaluate and pursue synergistic investments. These may include initiatives to expand on our current core capabilities or diversify into strategic market adjacencies that further differentiate the company. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bary Bailey, our CFO, who will give you more detail on our first quarter results and our financial position. Bary? Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Susan has provided you with an overview of the top line performance for the first quarter, which was pretty much in line with revenue guidance we provided in the last quarter's earnings call. Overall, gross margin in the quarter continued to hold up well and came in a little above our expectations that we communicated last quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, we saw a 230-basis-point improvement to 27.9% for the first quarter of 2010. The margin increase from last year was due to continued gross margin improvement in our Nurse and Allied segment, and by our higher-margin Physician Permanent Placement segment representing a greater portion of our business mix. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, we see margins holding steady with potential for some improvement due to continued reductions in the cost of health benefits and from changes in how we reimburse travelers for meals and incidentals. As we are all aware, throughout last year, the company took significant steps to rightsize the organization and improve the overall operating structure of the company in order to achieve sustained efficiencies. First quarter SG&A expenses of $32 million reflect the dollar impact of those changes and were 37% lower than prior year and slightly lower than prior quarter. Looking forward, we anticipate overall SG&A to gradually increase on a actual-dollar basis quarter-to-quarter, as we see modest growth in revenues. Our Nurse and Allied segment operating income for the first quarter was $8.7 million, representing a 41% decline as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in operating income in this segment is slightly lower than the revenue decline we saw, due in large part to the cost of revenue decreasing at a faster pace than revenue, mainly from lower labor costs. Nurse and Allied gross margin in the first quarter was 26.3%, 330 basis points higher than the same period in 2009, and as anticipated, 70 basis points lower than last quarter. Compared to last quarter, traveler volume increased 5% to 2,505, which represents the first sequential quarterly increase since the second quarter of 2008. Nurse and Allied segment SG&A was lower, reflecting the efforts taken to reduce ongoing operational costs. As the business rebounds, we expect expenses will increase at a faster pace than revenues in the short term. However, on the long term, we expect such expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. Overall, Nurse and Allied segment operating income margins increased to 11.6% from 9% in the first quarter of 2009. While revenue declined 3% on our Locum Tenens segment, days filled and gross margin held steady sequentially at about 43,000 and 26.2%, respectively. The operating margin for the first quarter was 9.1%, which is up 290 basis points compared to last year, although down 120 basis points compared to the previous quarter. The increase as compared to prior year was due to lower overall SG&A costs. The decreased operating margins as compared to prior quarter was primarily due to the favorable professional liability reserve adjustment we reported last quarter. Physician Permanent Placement operating income for the first quarter was $2 million, which declined 40% as compared to the same quarter last year and was flat sequentially. Gross margin in the first quarter was 57.9%, which is down 370 basis points compared to last year and 210 basis points compared to the previous quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin reflects the impact of the decline in realized deferred revenue. Unallocated overhead in the first quarter was $5.7 million, as compared to $6.1 million in the prior year and $5.4 million in the prior quarter. The increase as compared to prior quarter is due to our reflecting the cost of unused space in our leased facilities in unallocated overhead. Our income tax rate came in at about 64%. We had indicated the rate would be around 59%, which was our rate last year after adjusting for the impairment charges and restructuring costs. As discussed on the last call, our rate is impacted by permanent tax differences and by the cost of our uncertain tax positions associated with assumed-per-diem disallowances and the relative relationship to pretax income. As our pretax income increases over time, the impact of such items will have less of an impact to our rate. Our actual cash tax rate has been trending in the low 40s, in line with our statutory rate. For the first quarter, the company is reporting a net income of $800,000 or $0.02 per share. For the first quarter, we generated $11.7 million of operating cash flow, of which about $1.4 million went to reduced debt. Days sales outstanding were 56 days as compared to 57 last quarter. We continue to closely manage capital expenditures without limiting important investments. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $700,000. We expect capital expenditures in the future quarters of 2010 to be slightly above this level. As of March 31, our cash and equivalents totaled $36.6 million and our total term debt outstanding was $105 million, with no borrowings under the revolver. I will now return the call to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you very much, Bary. Our results would suggest that we did indeed see the trough of volume declines in our Nursing and Physician businesses during the latter part of 2009. On our last earnings call, we predicted that 2010 would be a period of stability and modest growth, albeit at a still uncertain trajectory. This continues to be our outlook today. Going into the second quarter, we anticipate nurse travel volumes to be roughly flat with the first quarter and Allied Staffing volumes to be down. We are also anticipating Locum Tenens to show improved sequential volumes based on growth in days sold in the first quarter. Our Physician Perm [Permanent] Placement business is also expecting modest sequential improvement based on growth in active searches and placements. Despite the improving trends across the business segments, overall demand is still at relatively low levels and constrained by high national unemployment and stagnant admission levels. As I have indicated in the past, historically, as we have entered into a downturn, we seem to hold on to our business longer and gain market share. Then as market drops to low levels, we lose our opportunity to outperform and there is a leveling effect. As the market stabilizes and improves, we begin to rebuild volume earlier and stronger than our competitors. This dynamic seems to be repeating itself today. Based on these factors, second quarter consolidated revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3% compared with the prior quarter. While the short-term trajectory of the recovery remains unclear, the long-term drivers of this industry remains strong. In the next five years, the aging population will continue to grow and require more healthcare services. At the same time, our clinical labor supply is aging and will begin to retire. Currently, 40% of nurses and over 50% of physicians are over the age of 50. This growing shortage will be further compounded by the limited capacity of our physician residency programs and nursing schools to produce new clinicians at the same pace. Given these short-term and long-term dynamics, we remain focused on the key components of our long- term strategic plan. And with that, we would now like to open up the call for your questions."

Joining us during the Q&A session will be Ralph Henderson, our President of Travel Nurse and Allied Staffing and Bob Livonius, our President of Workforce Solutions. I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Amy. Good afternoon and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s 2011 first quarter earnings conference call. We have good news to report today and are very pleased with the continued momentum and long- term outlook in our business. We have now experienced four consecutive quarters of sequential consolidated revenue growth, and the trends continue to look positive for the future. Demand continues to grow across the temporary staffing segment with the improvements being broad-based across many specialties, geographies and clients. Well, we were the first company in our industry to report growth a year ago. We are now pleased to hear that other companies are also reporting growth in demand and volumes. Our strongest and most consistent growth during the last year has come from our travel nursing business, with other businesses showing modest improvement or stabilization. While we have seen our staffing orders steadily improve throughout the country since last year, our ability to capture incremental market share has been bolstered by the expansion of our managed services program through last year’s acquisition of Medfinders. This was done by leveraging our significant national and local supply of candidates and increasing the direct fill rates on our MSP contracts. Whereas before we had to use subcontractors to fill our local per diem orders, we are now able to partially fill that demand directly through our Nursefinders local office network. Likewise, the travel nurse orders brought over by Medfinders MSP contracts are now primarily being directly filled by leveraging AMN’s large pool of travel professionals. We had projected to $2 million in annualized EBITDA synergies by the fourth quarter from this MSP direct fill synergy, and I am pleased to report that we are currently ahead of schedule towards achieving this target. With most of the heavy lifting complete, we are also currently ahead of schedule to achieving our targeted $8 million in annualized cost synergies. Since our last call, we have completed the integration of the Medfinders allied brand onto our platform. We have also completed the streamlining of our client and clinical operational functions into our share services model, and the integration of the finance function is complete. The overall Medfinders integration has progressed very and is exceeding our expectations. In fact, the total synergy target of $10 million which I just spoke of will be achieved by early in the third quarter, which is one quarter early. This could not have been accomplished without the talent and collaboration shown by our dedicated team members across the entire organization, and we command and thank them all for their great efforts. Now, I will turn to some detail on our trends and performance. Overall, consolidated revenues for the first quarter were $229 million, up 4% sequentially and 60% year- over-year. On an organic same-store basis, consolidated revenues were up 17% year-over-year. As I mentioned, this represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in consolidated revenues since the 2009 recession. It also marks the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and our largest business segment of nurse and allied staffing. In addition to our top-line performance, we are beginning to experience the benefits of operating leverage and cost synergies which helped deliver an adjusted EBITDA of $18 million and a margin of 7.9%. Even after excluding some unique items, we still delivered an adjusted EBITDA margin north of 6%. First quarter nurse and allied revenues were $135 million, up 6% sequentially despite the fact that there were too fewer days in the quarter. Year-over-year revenues were up 79% on a net reported basis and up 24% on an organic same-store basis. This growth was driven by the travel nurse business where revenues were up 13% sequentially. The volume growth occurred at both MSP and our traditional client with the pricing remaining relatively stable during the quarter. Travel nurse order levels have continued to increase for well over a year now. In fact, order levels in April were twice what they were a year ago. Demand is rising at both MSP clients, as well as at our traditional clients, and the overall number of facilities with travel nurse orders continues to move up. In April, client facilities with orders were up over 20% compared with the fourth quarter of 2010. The growth in orders is also occurring across most geographies, with our top five states spanning the west, northeast, the southeast and the south. Our MSP orders have been trending approximately 25% of our overall travel nursing demand, and we continue to be very successful in winning new MSP contracts at a pace faster than we anticipated. Another small but growing service is the assistance with electronic medical record implementation for our clients. We have been delivering this service for a couple of years now, both for our MSP clients and our traditional clients. However, we have more significant ramp and opportunities during the last year. The combination of our national supply and our local offices helps to make us an especially capable partner for our clients who are going through such a conversion. Based on the pace and stages of EMR implementation across the country, we believe there will be continued growing needs for this type of service during the next two to three years. With the growth in demand, we are now beginning to see more movement in pricing. During the first four months of 2011, we have implemented more than double the number of price increases versus the entire first half of 2010. We expect this trend to continue and probably will gain further momentum over the year. Keep in mind though that these increases are typically for future placements, so, it takes a couple of quarters to see the full benefit show up in results. This improved pricing will be an important factor in our ability to drive supply, to meet the growing demand, and to offset pressures in housing and bill pay spreads. First quarter revenues for the local per diem business were $23 million, which was down 3% sequentially, due largely to the high level of flu clinic business that we experienced during the fourth quarter. In addition to the seasonality, the local per diem revenues tend to fluctuate more due to the short-term nature of the business. Demand trends in local staffing are generally increasing, but are less consistent across different regions of the country. The local offices continue to be an important ingredient in our success in winning and filling MSP business. For both travel and local per diem staffing, supply will become an increasingly important area for us to focus due to the rising demand. We are pleased to see that our supply of new candidates coming into the travel business is growing. However, the available new supply in the per diem business has been a bit more challenging in some of the local markets. First quarter allied revenue, which made up approximately 20% of the segment revenues, was down 3% sequentially due mainly to the anticipated disruption from the allied integration. The underlying demand trends in the allied healthcare market appear to be solid, particularly in rehab therapy, and we expect to see growth in this business in the second half of the year. Our locum tenens segment delivered first quarter revenues of $70 million, which was up 1% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Organic same-store locum tenens revenues were up 6% compared with prior year. We had 2% sequential volume improvement with the greatest increase occurring in primary care. Our first quarter days available for placement were also up year-over-year in all specialties with the exception of radiology. Across the industry there seems to be general agreement that locum trends have stabilized and are beginning to improve. In physician permanent placement, first quarter revenues were $11 million, up 16% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Organic same-store revenues were up 29% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to the adoption of a new FASB accounting standard for revenue recognition, which had a positive revenue impact of $2.1 million in the first quarter. While we have made progress in building our sales team, we still have opportunity to capture more market demand, and so we continue to aggressively hire and train to build our sales team I this area. In the first quarter, revenues from home healthcare services were $13.6 million, representing a 5% sequential decline. The decline was anticipated and as expected the most significant pressure came in Medicare. Overall, we were probably down less than most companies in the industry due to our diversity and care mix. Medicare represents less than 20% of our total home healthcare revenues. We are expecting revenues to be up slightly in the second quarter with improvements in call care mixes. We are continuing to take steps to grow our Medicare and private pay business as these typically have higher growth and EBITDA margins. While we are projecting sequential growth, there are certainly headwinds that continue to challenge the home health industry. In addition to the Medicare reimbursement cuts that took effect in January, there were also regulations that took effect in April, requiring face-to-face physician encounters and additional documentation for therapy services. In spite of these short-term challenges homecare will play an increasingly important role for the healthcare delivery system in the future. Going into the second quarter, with the underlying market improving and much of the integration of Medfinders complete, the organization is beginning to hit on all cylinders and enjoy the synergies of the two companies coming together. More than ever, our focus is on understanding the needs of each individual client and executing to exceed their expectations. In growing our top-line revenues, we are setting ourselves up to hit our longer term objective of leveraging our operating model in order to achieve 10% adjusted EBITDA margins in the next three to five years. We are also focused on continuing to reduce our debt to EBITDA ratio. AMN has been an innovator in the industry, which has helped to position the company for the near term and the long term. In the near term, we have been and are continuing to capitalize on the improving demand as the market rebounds. Since combining with Medfinder, we have increased our cross-selling efforts and results by dedicating resources to evaluate our client’s strategic needs and to create solutions that deliver our multiple service lines. For example, we recently won a new contract with a significant healthcare system to deliver an MSP solution that supports all of their supplemental staffing needs for nurses, physicians and allied professionals. We will also be providing this client with RPO services and other workforce solutions that are not yet formally introduced to the marketplace. In the long term, we will continue to work alongside our clients to understand their changing needs. As healthcare delivery models transform to address the challenge of providing increased access to health services while maintaining the quality and reducing costs, AMN will offer more sophisticated solutions that can deliver value and efficiencies. Whether it’s through our MSP and RPO solutions or by using home healthcare to reduce unnecessary and unprofitable readmissions, AMN will continue to make strides in our long-term strategy. I will be coming back to you in our Q&A session to help further answer your questions. But for now, I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Brian Scott. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon everyone. As Susan mentioned, the first quarter revenue was $229 million. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.6%, up 170 basis points from last year and 150 basis points from last quarter. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to a $1.9 million actuarial base to workers compensation benefit, recorded in our nurse and allied and home healthcare segments. And $2.1 million of revenue recognized in our physical permanent placement segment as a result of adopting a new revenue recognition standard. Excluding these items, the gross margin was 28.1% which is consistent with the prior quarter. SG&A in the quarter totaled $52.9 million, which included $1.3 million of costs associated with the integration of Medfinders. SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 23.1% increased from prior year by 80 basis points, but decreased sequentially by 180 basis points. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the addition of Medfinders expenses. The sequential decrease was due to lower integration costs this quarter, as well as the fourth quarter including a $1.2 million bad debt expense related to a locum tenens client. As Susan noted earlier, we have made significant progress on our cost synergy targets during the first four months of 2011. And the sequentially lower first quarter SG&A in part reflected these efforts and our ability to leverage our infrastructure as revenue grows. We have been recently adding employees, primarily in sale ensured services to support our growth in travel nursing and new MSP clients. Considering this growth based hiring and further realization of cost synergies, we expect our SG&A in dollar terms to remain relatively consistent with current levels to the remainder of 2011. Our nurse and allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 6% to $135 million. Our volume grew 8% sequentially to 5,100 healthcare professionals and our revenue per day was flat sequentially on stable average bill rates. Nurse and allied gross margin increased sequentially by 140 basis points to 27.5% due in large part to the workers compensation actuarial adjustment, most of which benefited this segment. First quarter nurse and allied segment operating income was $15.1 million or 11.2% of revenue as compared to $10.7 million or 8.4% of revenue in the prior quarter. Excluding the workers compensation adjustment, the operating margin till improved sequentially by over 100 basis points due to cost synergies from integrating the Medfinders travel nurse and allied businesses, and improve operating leverage. Compared to the prior year, the operating margin declined by 40 basis points due mainly to the addition of Medfinders which carries an overall higher cost of operations for the local per diem staffing business. Our locum tenens segment revenue increased by 1% from the prior quarter, reflecting a 2% increase in day sales offset by a small decrease in our revenue per day sales due to a specialty mix shift. On an organic basis, the gross margin was 90 basis points below prior year due to pressure on the pay bill spread in certain specialties and higher travel and housing costs. On an as reported basis, gross margin of 26.2% was consistent with prior, due to the addition of the higher margin Medfinders locums business. The gross margin was sequentially higher by 80 basis points, due in part to a staffing project with a single during the quarter. Locum’s operating income of $6 million or 8.6% of revenue is compared to $4.8 million or 6.9% in the prior quarter. Within our physician permanent placement segment, revenue grew sequentially by 16% due to the adoption of a new accounting standard on revenue recognition effective on January 1, 2011. Upon adoption of the standard, we recognized approximately $2.1 million of revenue in the quarter, and would have been differed under the old standard. Excluding this impact, the revenue increased year-over-year by 13% due to the addition of Medfinders, and declined sequentially by 7% on lower hourly billing to direct mail activity. Physician permanent placement operating income for the first quarter was $3.8 million or 35.2% of revenue. Our home healthcare segment generated revenue of $13.6 million and operating income of $1 million for the quarter. Gross margin on this business was 38.1% for the quarter, an increase of 110 basis points from the prior quarter due to the workers compensation actuarial benefit. On allocated overhead excluding stock compensation integration expenses in the first quarter were $7.7 million, unchanged from the preceding quarter and higher than the prior year expense of $5.7 million. The increase compared to the prior year is mainly related to the addition of Medfinders. Our effective income tax rate for the first quarter was 55%. We expect our tax rate on a full year basis to be relatively consistent with the first quarter. This rate is different than the statutory rate in large part due to permanent differences having a disproportionate impact as a result of our near term lower pretax income. On a GAAP basis we reported net income of $2.3 million or $0.05 per diluted share which included a negative $0.02 impact from integration charges incurred in the quarter. First quarter operating cash flow was $5.6 million, day sales outstanding were 54 days as compared to 54 last quarter and capital expenditures for the first quarter were $1.7 million. As of March 31st, our cash and equivalents totaled $4 million, and our total term debt outstanding net of discount was $213 million. We also had $2 million drawn in our revolver. We’ll tend to use any excess cash flow generated through the year to pay down debt. Going into the second quarter of 2011, the nurse and allied staffing segment continues to experience positive momentum and is expected to grow sequentially by 2% to 4%. This growth, particularly in nurse staffing businesses is being driven by continued penetration of existing and new MSP accounts and a steady improvement in traditional client demand. Allied staffing revenue is expected to be flat as we stabilize from the disruption of integration activities. The locum tenens division is showing signs of modest improvement in demand which is expected to translate into sequential increase in revenue of 2% to 4%. Physician permanent placement revenue is expected to be flat excluding the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Our home healthcare division is expected to improve sequentially by approximately 5%. On a consolidated basis, second quarter revenues are expected to be between $234 million and $238 million. Gross margin for the second quarter is expected to fall between 27.5% and 28%, and SG&A is expected to remain roughly flat with the prior quarter of approximately $53 million. There are no material changes to the annual financial estimates we provided last quarter for depreciation, amortization, interests, expense, share count or capital expenditures. And with that, we’d like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you so much, Amy. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to AMN Healthcare's 2012 first quarter earnings conference call. We are pleased to report solid performance today reflecting steady progress towards our strategic calls of revenue growth as the market leader and innovator in Healthcare Workforce Solution and profitability growth through our achievement of operating leverage and improved adjusted EBITDA margins. In April, we also refinanced our credit agreement, which provides a lower cost of debt and created operating flexibility in the future. We'll talk more about the future in just a few minutes but first we will jump right in to overall results. First quarter consolidated revenues are $226 million were in line with our guidance range up 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth for the company. We also achieved a consolidated EBITDA margin of 7.7%, which was better than anticipated. Consolidated gross margins were 27.9% and at the high end of our expectation but they were down slightly from the prior year quarter due to increased housing and other direct cost. These were also offset by improved pricing and bill to pay spreads. Our growth in operating leverage was driven by several key factors. The first is that we are seeing the Medfinders acquisition continue to pay off as we experienced lower SG&A expenses on growing revenues. Another key factor is AMN's continued differentiation in the marketplace. We gained significant market share during 2011 due to our strength in MSP offering and our ability to deliver to our clients through higher fill rates. We continue to be successful and winning new MSP contracts and we are also continuing to see volume growth with our traditional clients. Currently about a third of our Nurse and Allied segment revenues are generated from MSP contracts. According to a recently release staffing industry analyst report MSP usage by large buyers of contingent labor and other industries ranges between 50 and 70%. It's uncertain whether healthcare will reach these high levels, but with estimates of our industry currently at 10% to 20% MSP utilization that certainly appears to be significantly more growth opportunity. As the leader and innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and in particular MSP we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. We also continue to experience increased interest from our client for other strategic workforce solutions such as recruitment process outsourcing, EMR staffing, and workforce consulting projects. These small but very strategic high margin solutions also help us to move towards our goal of achieving a 10% adjusted EBITDA margin in the next 3 to 5 year. Now I will turn to our results by business segment. First quarter Nurse and Allied revenues were $154 million up 4% sequentially and 14% year-over-over. This growth was driven mainly by the Travel Nurse business where revenues were up 9% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven by strong fill rates high rebook rates and increased nurse applicants. While our orders were softer at the beginning of the year, our team was able to maximize our opportunity with a very strong fill rates during the fourth quarter and the first quarter producing a very healthy sequential and year-over-year volume increase. While the second quarter of the year is often seasonally down for the Travel Nurse business. We are expecting to overcome that seasonal pressure and deliver volume that will be sequentially flat to slightly up. On a year-over-year basis, we expect to see volume of 15% to 17% in the second quarter. Open orders for the Travel Nurse business have increased nearly 50% since mid February and have been trending up steadily. Additionally, the combination of new clients and the diversity of opportunities that we offer candidate has resulted in higher rebook and retention rate of our Travel Nurses. First quarter Travel Nurse average bill rates were up 2% year-over-year and we expect similar bill rate improvements to continue throughout 2012. However, we anticipate gross margins to hold relatively steady since there will likely be continued upward pressure on temporary housing and other direct costs. First quarter local staffing revenues were $21 million, which was down 12% sequentially and 7% compared to prior year. As anticipated, revenues were lower sequentially due to the customary seasonal trends combined with the lack of any meaningful flu driven business so far in 2012. Revenues were also down to the closing of several underperforming offices in the fourth quarter. As mentioned on a last call, we have begun a strategic transformation of our local staffing business. Our strategy involves expanding branch presence in larger markets with significant MSP opportunity while closing underperforming offices in small markets. We recently opened a new office in New York City, to serve a very large MSP client and in latter half of the year, we anticipated opening to additional offices in other large metropolitan areas to serve recent MSP client wins. First quarter Allied revenues were $31 million, which was up 1% sequentially and up 7% year-over-year. The growth was due to higher volume in our therapy business. Going into the second quarter, allied order has continued to improve and volume is expected to be up again sequentially and year-over-year. The Allied team has delivered significant improvement in our sales productivity, margin management, and SG&A management. The result is an EBITDA margin that is now double what it was just two years ago. We are also seeing traction with more MSP clients in the allied business. Some of these clients are shared with the nurse staffing business and some are entirely allied MSP. And just like nursing the Allied fill rate are improving significantly and contributing to higher client satisfaction and the ability to win more new business due to our reputation for delivering results. Locum tenens first quarter revenues were $64 million down 2% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, although some of the sequential decline was due to normal seasonality. There was also the continued market driven impact of volume decreases in Radiology and Anesthesia. First quarter locum's gross margins improved 160 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points year-over- year. This was due primarily to improved bill rates and bill pay spreads resulting from the pricing and margin management process changes that we put into place at the end of last year. As we announced in March, we recently made leadership changes in Locum Tenens. In addition we are beginning to see a positive improvement in the business from other changes that were implemented over the last 6 months. Going into the second quarter overall Locum's revenues are expected to be up sequentially based on improved volume. We also expect to see further improvement in pricing and gross margins throughout the year. In physician permanent placement first quarter revenues were $9 million down 4% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. However including the prior year impact of adopting the revenue recognition accounting standard Perm revenues were up 4% year-over-year. The investments we made in growing our sales team throughout 2011 are beginning to payout with new searches up over 10% year-over-year in the first quarter. Going into the second quarter we expect a modest sequential increase in revenues due mainly to these increased new searches. Our placements for recruiter are returning to historic high levels due in part to the increase in active searches. Another contributor has been our increase investment in social and mobile media to reach out in a track a greater supply of physician candidate. We continue to focus on building our team, our marketers and recruiters to ensure that we are able to achieve the high fill rates on our active searches. As the innovator in healthcare workforce solutions, we were closely with our plans to understand the current and future challenges and to bring to life solutions that will help them better manage their clinical workforce. Our success so far particularly with MSP and RPO clients have shown that this strategy is a clear differentiator for us in the marketplace. To support our growth and innovation in workforce solutions, we continue to make internal investments to position us as the industry thought leader. Another big differentiator is our ability to quickly recruit for and fulfilled our client's demand for quality clinicians, especially as the industry continues to rebound. In future years we expect the clinician shortage to intensify as the aging population increases its demand for healthcare services. At the same time the aging clinician population will be retiring. These forces of strong demand and lagging supply of clinicians in almost every discipline, is expected to ramp up significantly in 2014 and beyond. Until that time to ensure we retain our competitive advantage as a recruitment powerhouse, we will continue to make internal investments in our social media, mobile and online technologies. Even though we will continue to leverage technology, we also know that we must maintain a personalized and streamline experience for our clients and clinicians. The number one reason they choose to work with us is because of the experience that they have interacting with our team members. Everyday our team members bring exceptional passion and commitment to delivering value to our healthcare clients and clinicians. This level of engagement and execution combined with our clear differentiated strategy has resulted in the positive results we are reporting today. I would like to thank each of our team members for the contributions to these results and to our ongoing success. I really wish every investor have the opportunity to come to our offices and meet our team members. It doesn't take long to see why so many clients and clinicians prefer to work with AMN. I will come back to you in our Q&A section along with Ralph and Bob, but for now I will turn the call over to our CFO, Brian Scott. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter revenue from continuing operations was $226.4 million, up 5% from last year and 2% from last quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was 27.9% at the upper end of our expectation, but down to 120 basis points from last year and down 40 basis points from last quarter. The year-over-year decrease was due to prior year benefits from accrual based workers compensation reserve adjustment in the Nurse and Allied segment and the impact from the 2011 adoption of a new revenue recognition accounting standard in the physician permanent placement segment excluding these items the year-over-year gross margin was higher by 30 basis points due to improved gross margins in both the physician segment. The sequential decrease was in line with our expectations in which even primarily by higher housing and other direct costs in the quarter total of $47.2 million or 20.8% of revenue compared to 22.6% in the same quarter last year and 22.1% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the absence of integration related expenses. The improved SG&A leverage from the acquisition synergies and refund received in connection with a favorable settlement of an assessment from the California Employment Development Department partly offset by higher professional liability and bad debt expenses. The settlement refund was recorded and unallocated corporate expenses. Compared to the prior quarter the decrease was due to continued operating leverage improvement and the settlement refund offset partly by higher professional liability cost. We expect that SG&A to increase somewhat in the second quarter to drive support growth in the business and the additional supply driven investments that Susan mentioned earlier. Our Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 4% to $153.9 million, volume grew 2.4% sequentially to 5,443 healthcare professionals and revenue per day was up 2.6% on higher bill rates and increase in hours worked. Nurse and Allied gross margin decreased in line with our expectations year-over-year by 110 basis points and sequentially by 100 basis points to 26.4%. Excluding the previously noted prior year workers compensation reserve benefit, segment gross margin was consistent year-over-year. The sequential margin decline was primarily from higher housing and other direct cost more than offsetting improved bill pay spread. In addition you may recall with the fourth quarter gross margin was particularly strong. First quarter Nurse and Allied operating income was $17.1 million or 11.1% of revenue as compared to $18.1 million or 12.2% of revenue in the prior quarter. The sequential decrease was due to the lower gross margin and an increase in SG&A related primarily to higher professional liability cost. A locum tenens segment revenue decreased by 1.6% from the prior quarter reflecting a 3.4% decrease in days filled and a 1.8% increase revenue per day filled. Gross margin of 27.1% was up by 90 basis points from the prior year and sequentially by a 160 basis points due to improved bill pay spread and favorable mix shift. Locum's operating income of $4.4 million or 7% of revenues compares to $3.9 million or 6.1% in the prior quarter. Within our physician permanent placement segment, revenue decreased sequentially by 4%. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined by 17%. However excluding a prior year adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standard, revenue was up year-over-year by 4%. Physician permanent placement operating income for the first quarter was $1.7 million or 18.9% of revenue. On a GAAP basis we reported first quarter pre-tax income from continuing operation to $6.8 million. Our tax rate in the quarter was 49% which is consistent with our current expected full year rate of approximately 50%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 7% for the first quarter which compares with the 4% in both the prior year and prior quarter. As March 31st, our cash equivalents totaled $4.9 million and our total debt outstanding net of discount with $193 million. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $9.6 million and capital expenditures for the first quarter were $1 million. Day sales outstanding, excluding the retained home healthcare accounts receivable were 56 days compared to 57 days in the last quarter and 54 days last year. Given the current favorable financing market and the company's improved financial performance in industry outlook on April 5th, we replaced our existing credit facilities with a new $200 million term loan and $50 million revolving Lien credit. The term loan which matures on April 2018 will initially bear interest at LIBOR by 475 basis points with a 1.25% LIBOR floor. It requires minimum annual payments of 1% of the initial principle balance and a standard require access cash flow payment due annually, which starts at 50%. The Revolver which matures in April 2017 will initially bear interest at LIBOR plus 425 basis points. Both facilities have an interest rate and excess cash flow step downs based on the company's financial leverage. The new credit agreement also has an improved covenant structure, which includes the financial leverage, ratio covenant and an interest coverage covenant. In conjunction with this transaction $3.9 million of transaction cost and $2 million original issue discounts were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the new agreement. We also expensed $8.6 million of non-cash deferred financing cost and original issue discount and a $1.2 million prepayment penalty associated with the previous credit facilities. These costs will be included in the interest expense in the second quarter. The lower debt interest rate will result in cash interest savings of approximately $1 million per quarter into 2014, and for the foreseeable future we intend to continue applying our excess free cash flow to pay down our debt balance. Now let's turn to our guidance for the second quarter. Consolidated revenues are expected to be between $229 million and $233 million driven by anticipated sequential growth across all business segments. Gross margin is expected to remain steady between 27.5% and 28%. SG&A expenses are anticipated to be approximately 21.2% to 22% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 7%. And with the new credit agreement we expect interest expense to be approximately $3.5 million per quarter for the remainder of 2012. This excludes the one-time write-off of fees associated with the old credit agreement. Also non-cash stock-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $1.6 million per quarter. With that, we would like to open up the call for questions. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director I think we are ready for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you so much, Amy. Good afternoon and welcome to AMN Healthcare's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. The strong first quarter results we will be discussing today were the outcome of overall solid market conditions, the continued benefit of our focus on delivering differentiated workforce solutions and excellent execution by our team. Our first quarter P&L performance reflects strength on top to bottom with year over year revenue increases, gross margin improvement and operating leverage across all business segments. Consolidated revenue grew by 11% and adjusted EBITDA by 21%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 8.4%. The largest contributor to our growth was the travel nurse business which grew revenue by 19% and adjusted EBITDA by 27% over prior year. But all segments delivered very solid performance including our local tenant business which achieved both year over year and sequential revenue growth. We continue to make progress with our strategy to expand our leadership position as the nation’s innovator in healthcare workforce solutions. In addition to the benefits of MSP wins from 2012, we’ve continued to add more new clients in 2013 and are very excited about the pipeline and potential new contracts we should close over the remaining of the year. It’s clear that healthcare organizations are seeking innovative ways to better manage their labor costs and ensure access to high quality clinicians when they are needed. The economic and patient care benefits of utilizing an MSP model are becoming more widely and we believe penetration will increase across all staffing segments. We are particularly excited about the momentum we are seeing in the adoption of Locums MSP. We now have a total of 6 Locums MSP clients in various stages of implementation. Approximately 30% of our first quarter consolidated revenues came from MSP contracts. Since our fill rates for MSP clients are higher than those in traditional clients, we were able to grow faster during periods of market expansion and it provides some protection during periods of demand softness. Now I will dive into our first quarter results by business segment. Nurse and allied staffing revenue was up 15% year over year and 1% sequentially, the largest contributor to growth was the higher volume in the travel nurse business which was driven in part due to year over year increases in orders, clients with orders and clients with clinicians on assignment and upside surprise was the exceptionally strong revenue from EMI engagements during the first quarter. While still a relatively small part of our overall business, our track record in helping clients to successfully work through EMI implementation with proper staffing and training is certainly becoming more notable. We also experienced an above normal flu season during January and February which contributed to higher orders and travellers on assignment. Going into the second quarter our MSP travel nurse orders have stayed relatively steady since the beginning of the year. However our non-MSP orders have declined sequentially due to a decline in winter seasonal demand and flu orders. In addition, there was some order fall-off due to the completion of a couple of large EMR projects in the first quarter. Although the EMR pipeline is strong for the second quarter it is unlikely to hit the peak level we experienced during the first quarter. In addition to these specific trends, our hospital clients have recently been exhibiting a more cautious mindset from the lower census in the first quarter and general confirms around the impact of sequestration. However recent reports indicate that hospital census is back up in April which may indicate this demand softness will be short lived. Based on the current demand environment, we are being conservative and expect volume in the travel nurse business to be up in the low teens year over year but down sequentially. This is primarily due to the exceptionally strong EMR and flu related business in the first quarter. Turning now to local staffing, first quarter revenue was up 4% compared to the prior year and 1% sequentially. Volume was flat both year over year and sequentially with the revenue increase being driven primarily by a mix shift toward higher skilled clinicians and increased bill rates. Going into the second quarter, local staffing revenues are expected to be up slightly year over year and down sequentially. First quarter allied staffing revenue was up 6% year over year but down 5% sequentially with the year over year growth driven by the strength in the imaging and lab specialties. Despite a decline in therapy orders driven by reimbursement cuts, therapy volumes were still slightly up year over year due to stronger fill rates and growth in our allied and MSP clients. Going into the second quarter allied revenues are anticipated to be down slightly both year over year and sequentially due to therapy weakness. Locums tenant first quarter revenue was up 3% year over year and up 4% sequentially. This sequential increase was due mainly to the growth in hospital and internal medicine sub-specialties as well as the advanced practice specialties such as nurse practitioners and CRNAs. This increase was offset by declines in the government and surgery specialties. With healthcare reform trends pointing toward advanced practice professionals having a greater role in primary care we have been investing in this area over the past year and are now beginning to see a payoff. Going into the second quarter Locums revenue is expected to be up year over year and up sequentially. In physician permanent placement, first quarter revenue was up 10% year over year and down 2% sequentially. The year over year improvement was driven by increased search activity and increased placements. The leadership team in this segment is doing an excellent job of diversifying into underdeveloped markets and continuing to leverage our expertise in relationships for the placement of physician leadership positions. They have also been creating new more effective methods of recruiting through our investments in digital marketing and social media. First quarter new searches were up sequentially and so going into the second quarter we anticipate that revenue will be up in the high single digits year over year and sequentially. We continue to be excited about the positive outlook for the next several years. Discussion regarding the healthcare workforce impact of the additional 3 million insurance citizens and coupled with a 30% increase in people aged 65 and older is expected to drive increased demand for healthcare services. As hospitals determine how they will meet this patient care demand in the midst of worsening labor shortage, they are increasingly adopting workforce solutions that provide cost benefits while enabling access to quality commissions. At the same time it appears that more clinicians are looking to make a job change. Based on a recent CareerBuilder survey over 1/3 of healthcare workers plan to look for a new job in 2013 and that’s up from 24% last year. Nearly half plan to look for a new job over the next few years. To ensure we are ready to maximize this future opportunity we have remained committed to our strategic investments in 3 key areas. The first is our digital transformation initiative to aggressively attract more clinician supply through innovative recruitment technologies, job distribution platform and mobile applications. The second is the continued differentiation and expansion of our suite of workforce solutions, and the third is streamlining our technology infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. We expect these investments to be an important contributor to delivering industry leading revenue growth and improved operating leverage in the future. Before I hand it off to Brian I would like to take a moment to thank our very talented team for the solid execution and passion for delivering excellence and quality to our clients and clinicians every day. Combined with our differentiated strategy our team member’s level of commitment have set AMN apart as a leader in the marketplace and enabled us to deliver strong results and greater shareholder value. I will come back to you in our Q&A section along with Ralph and Bob to help answer your questions. But for now I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. First quarter revenue was $252.1 million, up 11.4% from last year and 1.7% from last quarter. Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance on better than expected performance across all of our segments with the largest upside coming from the stronger EMR revenue Susan mentioned earlier. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29%, up 110 basis points from last year and 50 basis points from last quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to improvements across all business segments with an 80 basis point increase in the Locum Tenens staffing segment. There was also a $1.2 million actuarial based workers’ compensation benefit in the nurse and allied segment recorded during the current quarter. SG&A in the quarter totaled 53.6 million or 21.3% of revenue compared to 20.8% in the same quarter last year and 21.4% in the prior quarter. The increase in the prior year was due primarily to higher spending in support of revenue growth including employee headcount, commissions and other growth driven costs as well as our prior year $2 million refund received in connection with the settlement of an assessment with the California EDD and was partially offset by improved operating leverage. Our first quarter Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased 14.9% from the prior year and sequentially by 1% to $176.8 million. Volume grew 14.2% year-over-year and 2.3% sequentially to an average of 6,215 clinicians on assignment. Revenue per day was up 1.7% year-over-year and 0.9% sequentially due to an increase in the average bill rate and our favorable business mix. Nurse and Allied gross margin increased year over year by 110 basis points and sequentially by 90 basis points to 27.5% due primarily to the previously noted workers’ compensation reserve adjustment and lower health insurance costs. First quarter nurse and allied operating margin was 12.7%, an increase of 160 basis points from the prior year on improved operating leverage and the higher gross margin. Sequentially the operating margin was 40 basis points higher due to the favorable workers’ compensation reserve adjustment. First quarter Locums tenens segment revenue of $65.5 million increased 3.1% compared to the prior year and 4.3% sequentially. Patient volume was lower by 1% from the prior year but higher by 2% sequentially. Revenue per day sales was higher by 5% year over year and 2% sequentially on average bill rates and a specialty mix shift. Gross margin of 27.9% was up by 80 basis points from the prior year due to improved bill rates and bill-pay spreads. The Locum Tenens segment reported operating margin was 7.5% an increased 50 basis points from the prior year but lower by 20 basis points in the prior quarter. The sequential margin decline resulted in part from additional hiring for growth. We continue to believe there is opportunity to significantly improve the operating margins at our Locums business. Our first quarter Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $9.9 million, up year-over-year by 9.8% and down sequentially by 2%. Gross margin improved by 310 basis points from the prior year due to improved sales productivity but was down by 260 basis points from the prior quarter due mainly to the prior quarter reduction to our sales reserve. Physician Permanent Placement operating margin was 22.6%, above the prior year by 370 basis points on the improved gross margin. On a sequential the operating margin improved by 210 basis points with the lower gross margin being more than offset by lower SG&A. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was 21.1 million, representing 8.4% of revenue. This compares to $17.5 million or 7.7% of revenue in the prior year and 19.2 million or 7.8% of revenue in the prior quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was $2.9 million, which compares to $5.5 million last year and $3.2 million last quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was 43%, which was in line with our guidance, based on our current projections, we expect the same 43% rate for the second quarter and for the full year 2013. We reported net income of $7.6 million in the first quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.16 for the first quarter which compares to $0.07 in the first quarter of last year. Cash used in operations for the quarter was 2.7 million driven by growth in working capital from higher revenues and increase in DSO. Days sales outstanding were 56 days compared to 53 days in the last quarter and 57 days last year. The sequential increase in DSO was a result of higher EMR staffing revenue which typically has a slower payment cycle and higher revenue later in the quarter which would be collected during the second quarter. We do anticipate DSO will decline in the second quarter and expect positive operating cash flow for the remainder of 2013. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $2.2 million. As of March 31, our cash and equivalents totaled $1.9 million. We had 1 million drawn on our revolver and a long term debt outstanding was $158 million, a $35 million reduction from a year ago. Our leverage ratio as calculated for our credit agreement was 2.3 times as compared to 3.2 times last year. The company’s amendment to its credit agreement went to effect on April 9 reducing the interest rate on the term loan by 200 basis points to 3.75%. The rate on the revolver was reduced by 150 basis points to 2.5%. In conjunction with the amendment we will charge approximately $1 million through interest expense in the second quarter. Now let's turn to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect consolidated revenue to be between $251 million and $255 million, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 6% to 8%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 28.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be 21% to 21.5%, and adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be between 7.5% and 8%. For the second quarter, we expect interest expense to be $2 million excluding the $1 million charge associated with the credit agreement amendment. Non-cash stock based compensation expense is expected to be $1.5 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2.5 million for the second quarter. And diluted share count is expected to be $47.9 million for the first quarter and $48 million for the full year. And with that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."
54,GV_144520_2008Q2,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for standing by. Welcome to the AMN Healthcare Services second quarter 2008 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given to you at that time. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Christopher Schwartz, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christopher Schwartz Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the AMN Healthcare Services conference call to discuss the company's earnings results for the second quarter 2008. For the call this afternoon, we have Susan Nowakowski, AMN's President and Chief Executive Officer and David Dreyer, AMN's Chief Financial Officer. A replay of this webcast is available at amnhealthcare.com/investors and will be replayed until August 20, 2008. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may, and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements. As a result of various important factors including those identified in our annual report on form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 and our current reports on form 8K which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to us. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN's Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan Nowakowski Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. As we enter the second half of what has no doubt been a year of uncertainty for the financial markets, we are feeling very good about our performance and our ability to grow revenues and achieve solid earnings growth for the year. Healthcare services is proving to be one of the most resilient markets in the overall economy and the AMN business model and competitive strategy continues to build our market share and deliver superior long- term shareholder value. AMN's revenue for the second quarter of 2008 was 313 million, 6% higher than the same quarter last year. While diluted earnings per share of $0.27 increased 4% over last year. Revenues in all of our business segments grew on a year-over-year basis with the biggest contributor being the addition of allied revenues from the Platinum Select acquisition we completed in February. We also achieved organic growth in our travel nurse, travel allied and locum tenens businesses. Despite a tight economic environment, we have been able to achieve increases in pricing in gross margin. Revenue for healthcare professional working increased 4%, reflecting the relatively healthy demand for quality clinicians. Just as important, we have been able to grow gross margins by expanding bill pay spreads and lowering healthcare insurance costs. This quarter's gross margin was up almost 90 points over last year, resulting in overall gross profit growth of 10%. The higher gross margin contributed to growth in EPS but earnings per share grew at a slower rate of 4% due mostly to SG&A costs including spending and support of strategic initiatives to further diversify and augment our growth. David will discuss other contributors later. In our nurse and allied staffing business, revenues grew 7% over the prior year and 6% sequentially. The addition of Platinum Select was the biggest contributor to this growth, however, our organic travel nurse revenues were also up 2% sequentially and 2% year-over- year. These increases were offset by the continued decline in international nurse revenue due to retrogression. Gross margin in the nurse and allied staffing business increased 120 basis points compared to last year. Our ability to achieve price increases continues to trend within our expectations, translating into revenue for traveler per day growing at 4% year-over-year. We have also seen good trends regarding housing costs. Last quarter, we saw early indications that our average daily rep costs were stabilizing. This favorable trend continued into the second quarter and when combined with the great work by our internal team, our housing expenses began to decrease as a percent of revenue. Demand for travel nurses has been steady and aggregate but mixed across the country. We have seen the greatest increases in the West with California leading the way with orders up double digits year-over-year. At the other end of the spectrum, some historically strong states such as Florida and Arizona are down in orders. We do expect a demand pickup in these seasonal states as we approach winter and in fact, we are starting to receive some of those orders now and expect more over the next two months. There is certainly strong demand in other attractive regions such as the northwest and central states and our recruitment and account management teams are doing a great job in directing our candidates supply to where it is needed most. We believe that our strategy to have more orders in more diverse locations and low customer concentration is benefiting us during this type of market. We expect to be able to direct our supply accordingly and continue to grow nurse volumes in revenues, albeit at a modest level throughout the remainder of the year. Our allied business also grew organically on a sequential basis, although it remained flat year-over-year. Our strongest growth in the second quarter came from our high margin rehab therapy specialties which grew double digits in volume and revenue on both comps. The placement of imaging specialists continues to be below expectations due to the lower demand, a trend that has been felt across the entire industry. Since the beginning of the year, we have reallocated resources from imaging to therapy and other new specialties like lab technician in order to maximize the growth of this group long-term. Now, turning to our locum tenens staffing business, this division experienced revenue growth at 5% compared to last year and 10% compared to last quarter. Days filled volume for the quarter rose 10% sequentially, reflecting an important gain in momentum for this division. We do not believe that our year- over-year growth at 5% is reflective of the market potential within the locums industry. In fact, if we dissect our different specialty groups, several are growing double-digit year-over-year. Primary care, our largest division and behavioral health are both up more than 15% year-over-year. Our aggregate performance though is being pulled back by two issues which we discussed last quarter. The first is lower demand for radiologists due to changes in reimbursement and financial pressures felt by our clients. From trends we have seen in our radiology division over the past few months and some very hard work by our team, we believe we have passed the bottom of this effect and we are now seeing modest but measurable gains in the business. The second impact is performance shortfalls in the western divisions of our anesthesiology and surgery specialties. As we enter the third quarter, we are seeing performance improvements in these divisions and do expect sequential growth. Based on the current market and our July placement trends, we are expecting to deliver stronger year-over-year growth in our locum segment during the second half of the year. Pricing continues to be solid across all physicians’ specialties with the exception of radiology. On a year- over-year basis, revenue per day still increased a total of 4.4%, led by primary care and surgery. While pricing for radiology was up year-over-year, there was a downward trend from the first quarter. All other specialties experienced sequential growth in pricing, a good reflection of a continued, healthy demand environment and our ability to sell our value as a high quality physician provider. Some of our newer divisions such as dentistry are ramping up in-line with expectations but at this stage, they are still too small to move the aggregate growth needle. In our physician permanent placement business, revenue in the second quarter increased by 7% compared to last year and 2% sequentially. There are no public counts to know how this growth compares to industry trends but we believe that the market opportunity should allow for stronger growth in the future. As the leader in this industry, our sites are focused on top-line growth in excess of 10% in the long-term. New searches and placements during the second quarter were below our expectations. However, as we begin the third quarter, we are on a better track and new searches for the month of July were up 17% from our second quarter average. As I mentioned earlier, we have several initiatives focused on further diversifying our product lines and broadening our client base in order to increase our growth opportunities. Some of these initiatives will are generate revenue in 2008 but most are expected to drive incremental revenue in 2009 and beyond. An example of a current expansion is the launch of our surgery center staffing business which was introduced to the market in June. Spending on these initiatives contributed to a modest increase in SG&A this quarter. However, we believe that these efforts are well-timed to continue to build the business to match the changing trends of how and where healthcare services are delivered. With that, I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, David Dreyer. David? David Dreyer Thank you, Susan and good afternoon. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $313 million, 6% higher than the second quarter of last year and 7% higher than last quarter and within our guidance range. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due mainly to the addition of Platinum Select and growth in our physician staffing businesses. The sequential increase in revenue was due to volume growth and our locum tenens segment, organic growth in our nurse and allied segment and a full quarter of revenue from Platinum Select. Consolidated gross margin in the second quarter was 26.4%, up 90 basis points from last year and unchanged from last quarter. The year-over-year improvement in gross margin was driven by a more favorable bill pay spread in our nurse and allied segment. Although this was the second quarter in a row that we achieved a strong year-over-year increase in consolidated gross margin. We anticipate our gross margin to remain fairly stable. SG&A expenses in the second quarter were up 12% over last year and 9% over last quarter. The increase in SG&A compared to last year was mainly attributable to the acquisitions of Platinum Select and Rx Pro Health along with higher insurance costs in our locum tenens segment while the increase compared to last quarter was due mainly to the higher insurance cost. Also, contributing to the increase this quarter was an increase in bad debt expense related to a bankruptcy involving a large former locum tenens radiology client and higher expenses in support of the strategic initiatives that Susan just mentioned. Despite the growing reimbursement pressure from our non-hospital base radiology customers, we do not believe that we have overall exposure to bad debt loss has not increased. Looking to the second half of the year, we will continue to carefully manage SG&A expenses in relation to gross profit in order to achieve our full year earnings expectation. Depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter was $3.7 million, up 31% over last year and 12% over last quarter. This expense is comprised of $2.5 million in depreciation and $1.2 million in amortization, compared to the same quarter last year, depreciation increased by $500,000 due mainly to internally developed Software projects placed in service in late 2007. Amortization increased by $400,000 compared to last year due mainly to the acquisitions of Platinum Select and RX Pro Health. Depreciation and amortization in the third and fourth quarter is expected to remain stable and with the second quarter as a percentage of revenue in-line with what was previously considered in our 2008 guidance. Net interest expense in the second quarter was $2.7 million, down 50% compared to the same quarter last year and down 5% compared to last quarter. The year-over-year decrease reflects the pay down of $38 million of our term loan and reductions in LIBOR rates over the past year. Including the effect of our interest rate swap agreements, the interest rate on our term debt decreased to 5.7% this quarter, down 100 basis points compared to the same quarter last year. In order to continue to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, we entered into a number of new LIBOR swap agreements this quarter. The effective income tax rate this quarter was 41.5% as compared to the 41.2% reported last quarter. For the full year 2008, we continue to project an income tax rate of approximately 41%. The primary reason our effective tax rate has increased from last year's 40% rate is due to our acquisition of Platinum Select. Net income in the second quarter was $9.4 million, consistent with last year and last quarter. Earnings per share of $0.27, was up 4% over last year and at the mid-point of our guidance range. Earnings per share this quarter decreased $0.01 from last quarter, due mainly to the combined effect of higher insurance costs along with the expenses in support of the strategic initiatives mentioned earlier. Fully diluted shares outstanding during the second quarter were $34.3 million, down 3% from last year and steady to last quarter. We repurchased 368,000 shares of our common stock during the quarter at a cost of approximately 6.4 million or $17.49 per share. After taking into account the repurchases completed during the second quarter, we have 32 million available for repurchases under the plan. We generated 12 million of cash flow from operations during the second quarter which, when combined with $8 million of cash on hand, revolver drawdowns were used primarily to pay estimated taxes, partially settle an acquisition hold back reserve and fund the stock repurchases. We ended the quarter with $154 million of debt. Our leverage ratio is 1.6 times trailing adjusted EBITDA compared to 1.8 times a year ago. DSO at the end of the quarter was 58 days, down two days from last year and last quarter, reflecting continued improvement in our collection efforts. Now, turning to our business segments, revenue in the nurse and allied segment this quarter was 215.3 million, up 7% over the prior year and 6% sequentially, travelers on assignment averaged 7,207 this quarter, up 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially due primarily to the addition of Platinum Select. Gross profit for traveler per day in the second quarter increased 10% year-over-year and 3% sequentially driven by the wider bill pay spread. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the segment was 7.8%, up 100 basis points over last year and 20 basis points over last quarter. Revenue in the locum tenens segment increased to 84 million this quarter, up 5% from last year and 10% from last quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven mainly by the higher average bill rates across all specialties. Compared to last quarter, the higher locum tenens revenue was due to growth and days filled, particularly in our primary care and behavioral health divisions. Days filled volume overall for the locum tenens business increased 10% sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.1%, down 370 basis points from last year and 230 basis points from last quarter due to the higher insurance cost and the bad debt expense. Our insurance costs can vary significantly from quarter- to-quarter. However, over the longer term, we anticipate these costs will remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue. Revenues in the physician permanent placement business were 13.5 million, up 7% from last year and 2% from last quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin for this business was 28.6%, up 550 basis points from last year and 340 base points from last quarter. This is mainly due to a reduction in SG&A expenses which included a favorable claims settlement. Now, I will provide you with our revenue and earnings guidance for the third quarter and the full year. Based on trends, experienced in July, along with seasonal patterns expected to pick up during the third and fourth quarters, we reaffirm our projected diluted earnings per share growth of 11% to 16% or $1.16 to $1.22. We are also narrowing our projected revenue growth for the full year to 6% to 8% or 1.23 billion to 1.26 billion. For the third quarter, revenues expected to range from 320 million to 323 million and diluted earnings per share to range from $0.31 to $0.33. Now, I will turn the call back over to Susan. Susan Nowakowski Thank you, David. There are many positive trends in our business today that point to continued health in our markets and growth opportunities for the future. Again, we expect all of our business segments to achieve year-over-year and sequential growth in the third quarter. While there have been no changes in the long-term fundamentals that drive our business, there are certainly some short-term challenges. All in, our full-year revenue growth should exceed the industry average. Even more importantly, our expectations to grow earnings at a stronger pace of 11% to 16%, reflects our team's commitment and ability to continue to carefully manage costs and deliver stronger shareholder value. Because of our diversified business model, we are able to constantly evaluate our market and reallocate resources to pursue the best opportunities. In addition to our focus on efficiency and daily execution, we are also continuing to make investments in some of our newer, faster-growing services to continue to drive new revenue channels. All of these things we have discussed are solid execution, and the continued development of new business opportunities are clearly a reflection of the strength of our leadership and sales and service teams. I want to thank all of the AMN team members for sharing their great talents and their commitment and hard work to continue to serve our clients and to deliver greater shareholder value. Now, we will take your questions."
55,GV_144520_2009Q2,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AMN Healthcare Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Susan Nowakowski, President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you. Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the AMN Healthcare Services Conference Call to discuss the company's earnings results for the second quarter of 2009. I will be giving an overview of general business trends and our strategic approach to the market place. Later in the call, we will also have David Dreyer, AMN's Chief Financial Officer to give you an overview of our earnings results. At this time, I would like to introduce Amy Chang, who is assuming responsibility for Investor Relations. Amy has been with AMN for over seven years and has held various roles within the company, giving her deep knowledge about both the industry, as well as our operations. I will now turn the call to over to Amy Chang, AMN Healthcare's Vice President of Investor Relations. Amy Chang Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to AMN Healthcare's Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. A replay of this webcast is available at amnhealthcare.com\investors, and will be available until August 20, 2009. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statement that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report of Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and other quarterly and periodic reports which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for our future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current belief and are based upon information currently available to it. Development subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call back over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Amy. By now, I'm sure you have all heard the words, we are challenged by the economic market condition, more than you care to, and our industry is clearly not immune to the impacts of this environment. However, I will say that a key differentiator for AMN is that we are steadfast in our execution of the strategic initiative that will position us to evolve our service lines with the changing healthcare environment and drive future long-term growth. We are the recognized leader and innovator in the industry, and we think this environment provides us with unique opportunities to bolster our position in the marketplace and continue our evolution as a company. There are four key areas that set us apart. First, we continue to be focused on maintaining and building stronger client relationships, and we are aggressively pursuing preferred provider and vendor management contracts; second, we have made significant progress in our new market expansion initiatives to further diversify our service lines; third, we continue to streamline our operational cost structure to deliver consistent operating margins and improve our margins and profitability as the market resumes growth; and fourth, we have strengthened our balance sheet by paying down our debt and increasing cash, putting us in a strong position to take advantage of future market expansion opportunities. Our ability to remain agile and execute well in the short-term, while keeping an eye on nurturing our new service lines, will allow us to emerge from this economic cycle as a stronger leader and better positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities. Short-term demand trends are still challenging, but have become more stable and are even showing small signs of improvement. Some healthcare facilities are reporting slight growth in admission levels. However, this is not yet translated into a material improvement in temporary staffing demand. The economic environment and high unemployment rate have temporarily made it easier for facilities to recruit from net healthcare professionals to encourage us to work more hours, and at the same time, reduce attrition rates. This is consistent with the Bureau of Labor Statistics report that healthcare job quits were down in April 31% over prior year. Similar to the trends we saw in the previous downturn, clinical professionals are postponing retirements. Those who left the workforce are returning, and many who were working part-time are now working full- time. However, these are not considered sustainable trends in the long term. Further contributing to lower staffing demand is the challenge facilities are facing in accessing traditional cash flow and capital sources. A significant portion of admissions improvement has been driven by the uninsured, and facilities are seeing substantial increases in their charity care and uninsured discounts. Little or no access to capital caused many hospital to temporarily put capital expansion plans on hold, which in turn affects their immediate need for increased number of clinicians. Despite these short-term trends, the long-term fundamentals that drive our industry have not changed. In order to serve the growing aging population and the expected increase in patient flow due to healthcare reform, hospitals still believe it is critical to stay focused on physician recruitment and long-term expansion of clinical services. Most agree, it is not a matter of if there will be an increased demand for clinicians, but more a matter of the timing and severity of the shortages that are looming ahead. While there is still much uncertainty around what will be passed in healthcare reform, most experts believe there will be increased access to care and an increased emphasis placed on preventative and early diagnostic care, both of which will increase the demand for our primary care physicians. We anticipate this to be a positive trend for our Locum Tenens business, as primary care is our largest specialty. While the long-term fundamentals are still very compelling, in the short-term, the economic environment is resulting in lower demand for temporary clinical staff and continues to impact our business, so we have been adjusting accordingly. During the second quarter, we experienced a decline in consolidated revenues of 36% over last year. The biggest contributor was a volume decline in the Nursing and Allied segment which experienced a 48% year-over-year drop in revenue. While we are certainly not happy with these numbers, we do believe that the strength of our relationships across our broad and diverse client base and our focus on delivering noticeably differentiated service and quality will enable us to grow more quickly as the market recovers. Some competitors have been eliminating their field sales staff. However, we have been careful to reduce and streamline our infrastructure in a strategic way to retain a strong, experienced sales force and minimize the disruption in our client relationships and keep us top of mind as our clients needs increase. We have already began benefiting from these efforts this year. Our client satisfaction levels are up year- over-year, and we are experiencing important wins from our aggressive pursuit of preferred provider relationships that gives us lead time or exclusivity on orders. The current market environment of low demand and vendor rationalization trends has enabled us to leverage our strengths as the industry leader, and position AMN as the preferred provider and master vendor supplier, particularly, as small competitors grapple with performance and cash flow issues. In the first half of the year, our number of preferred provider relationships increased by over three fold. A specific and important example of this is a recent contract that we secured with one of the largest and fastest-growing home health providers in the country, where we were selected as a primary supplier with lead time on all orders for their temporary Nursing and Allied staffing needs. Not only does this help us in generating demand and placements now, but it set us up to grow faster as the market returns by having these strategic relationships already established. Our industry-leading position has also helped increase our share of the travel nurse supply. It's not surprising that healthcare professional prefer working with a company that has more orders and financial stability, particularly, during these uncertain economic times. As the market begins to grow, we believe our preferred position with both healthcare professionals and clients will enable us to pick up volumes and placements more quickly. This is clearly than our pattern during the last two periods of market rebound. Our Locum Tenens segment achieved second quarter revenues of 79 million, which is 6% lower compared with prior year, but a 6% increase over last quarter. Our results were driven by sequential improvements in volume across all specialties. The sequential improvements in Surgery and Anesthesia were a notable turn and are consistent with the flat to slight improvements in surgical volumes reported by healthcare facilities. While Radiology also experienced the sequential volume increase, we anticipate that the radiology environment will remain at lower demand levels until reimbursement rates are adjusted. Although pricing was up in most specialties, revenue per days filled was flat year-over-year, due primarily to a mix shift away from our highest bill-rate group of Radiology, as well as some of internal medicine sub-specialties. If you look at our results excluding the Radiology division, revenue was basically flat on a year-over- year basis. Overall, our days filled volume for the quarter was down 5% over prior year and was up 4% sequentially. While the physician market has not been nearly as impacted by the economy as the nursing market, it has not been immune to it either. During the second quarter, our overall days available, which is a leading indicator of demand, was at a lower level compared with prior year. However, we are seeing signs of demand stabilization as we experienced a modest sequential growth in days available across all specialties in the second quarter. Additionally, fill rates continue to be at higher levels over last year across all of our specialties. In addition to focusing on daily execution, we have also dedicated resources to new areas that will fuel our future growth in the physician market. Last quarter, we announced our re-entry into the emergency medicine staffing market, and have been able to get off to a fast start by leveraging the strong relationships we already have with hospitals. This division is small today, but we seem to be on track to achieving our longer-term goal of adding 10% to 20% more revenue opportunity to our Locums business as this specialty matures. In Physician Permanent Placements, second quarter revenues were 9 million, which is 34% below prior year. The decline was driven primarily by a decrease in placement volume and pricing from lower overall demand in new retained search activity. Hospitals continue to focus on physician recruitment as a strategic part of their growth initiative. However, in order to lower their costs, some are attempting to hire physicians more directly through their own internal recruitment efforts. Over the years, we've seen this trend come and go with varying levels of success. Another short-term complication affecting the supply of candidates has been the current housing market, which has made physicians less willing to relocate. In response to the market environment, we have placed a renewed emphasis on sales training regarding the marketing and client education process. This might sound simplistic, but it is a very different sell in today's uncertain economic environment. While most current and potential clients know they will have long-term increase needs for physicians, many are in a wait-and-see mode, and are preferring to recruit more slowly until they have a clearer view of the future. If we can provide them with better information on how the future increase in patients flow will affect them, we can opt and help them to make a more educated and timely hiring decision. Across all business lines, we have been proactive and disciplined in adjusting our infrastructure. Some of the cost reductions, we have made in direct response to the short-term volume trends. However, many of the changes are permanent and strategic improvements to our business model and cost structure. We discussed several of these initiatives in our previous earnings call, and are pleased with the progress that have been made. During the quarter, we have further streamlined our business models through additional moves to consolidate facilities and centralize brand and back-office operations, which will improve our profitability and better leverage our infrastructure in the future. These changes and cost reduction have taken a tremendous amount of hard work, fortitude and personal sacrifice from our team members. Our success through these transitions is a testament to the passion and commitment of every single person at AMN. I know I speak for the entire management team and our board when I say, ""Thank you,"" to our talented team members for maintaining such an unwavering resolve, and having the courage to execute rapidly on critical changes during this unprecedented time in our market. Despite the market-driven declines in revenue, we have capped a steadfast strategic focus on staying close to our current clients, but we're also investing resources in pursuing new service offerings such as recruitment process outsourcing, and dentistry, emergency management and home health staffing. These efforts position us to continue our track record of innovation and executing on our long-term strategy of investing an additional new market opportunities that will be synergistic with our core service offerings. No other company in our industry has increased their service-offering reach to the same extent, and what's more notable is that we've been able to make these investments while maintaining consistent levels of operating margins. At this point, I would like to now turn the call over to David Dreyer, our CFO, who will give you more detail on our second quarter results. David? David C. Dreyer Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Well, thank you, Susan and good afternoon. Total revenue for the quarter was 199 million, a decline of 20% from the first quarter and in line with the outlook provided last quarter. This decline was driven primarily by lower volume in our Nursing and Allied segment, as we continue to be impacted by economic conditions. Gross margin in the second quarter came in at 27.0% versus 26.4% in the prior year and 25.6% last quarter. The increase from last year and last quarter was due primarily to a shift in our business mix, as Travel Nursing has become a smaller portion of the overall business, as well as aggressive management of direct cost. SG&A expenses, which included approximately 3.5 million in favorable adjustments to our professional liability insurance reserves, came in at 38 million, which was 37% lower than prior year and 24% lower than prior quarter. This lower level of SG&A reflects our infrastructure adjustments in response to the sharp revenue declines we have experienced, as well as the insurance adjustments. As a result of continued focus on operating efficiency, we expect our SG&A spending levels to continue to decline through the third quarter and stabilize in the fourth quarter. As a result of the strategic branding and facility consolidation initiatives, we recorded a restructuring charge of 2.2 million in the second quarter, of which approximately 900,000 was related to severance and approximately 1.3 million was related to lease terminations and other expenses. These actions were taken after a detailed brand analysis, while we expect to experience a slight temporary reduction of volume due to the disruption. We have improved our platform for execution in both our existing and new business lines. The company expects to record additional restructuring costs of approximately 7 million to 8 million in the second half of the year, of which about half will be cash outlays in the current year. The company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.8% compared to 46.9% last year and 28.5% last quarter. The sequential change reflects an updated projection of a smaller full-year net loss than previously estimated, which requires booking tax at a higher rate to true up the difference. Our full year 2009 effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 28%. As previously mentioned, the primary difference in our 2009 projected tax rate as compared to the statutory tax rate is the impact of permanent differences associated with the restructuring and asset impairments recorded in the first quarter. The company recorded net income of 4.4 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring charges, but including the $0.06 benefit from the adjustment to our insurance reserves, the company's net income on an adjusted basis was 5.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, which was assisted by significant reductions in accounts receivable. During the second quarter, we generated 36 million of operating cash flow, which was used primarily to pay down debt. DSO improved by two days to 52 days, as the team has done an excellent job managing collections in the current challenging market. We ended the quarter with 90 million of debt outstanding, a reduction of 56 million since the beginning of the year, and a debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.1x, an improvement compared to 1.6x a year ago. We are well within compliance with our debt covenants. In addition, we've been able to grow our cash and equivalents by 12 million since year end up to 23 million. Now turning to our business segments. Revenue in the Nursing and Allied segment was 111 million for the quarter, reflecting a 48% decrease from prior year and a 32% decrease sequentially. Travelers on Assignment averaged 3,661 this quarter, down 49% versus the same quarter last year and 33% sequentially. Gross margin of 25.0% was 50 basis points higher than last year and 200 basis points higher than last quarter, mainly from effective management of direct cost. Average revenue per traveler per day was up slightly due to relatively stable pricing and a slight increase on hours worked. The adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment was 6.2% for the quarter, down 30 basis points sequentially and down 160 basis points from last year, due primarily to the revenue decline outpacing our ability to cut SG&A spending. Revenue in the Locum Tenens segment this quarter was 79 million, a 6% decrease from last year and a 6% increase from last quarter. The year-over-year decline was due almost entirely to lower volume, as revenue per days filled remained generally stable. Gross margin for the quarter was 26.1%, up 30 basis points compared to last year, and down 10 basis points versus prior quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.4% was up 6.3 percentage points from last year and last quarter due to significant lower SG&A spending, as well as the previously discussed professional liability insurance benefit. Backing out the insurance benefits would've yield a 7.4% adjusted EBITDA margin, 2.3 percentage points higher than prior year and prior quarter. Revenue for the Physician Permanent Placement segment was 9 million, down 34% from last year and down 19% from last quarter. These decreases were driven mostly by declines in new search and placement levels along with lower average fees. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 24.8%, down 380 basis points compared to prior year and down 300 basis points from last quarter. I'll now return the call back to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, David. Before I give out the outlook on business trends, I would like to thank David for his outstanding contributions and service to AMN over the past five years. Earlier this year, David made a decision to pursue other career opportunities, and has since helped the company to have a smooth and seamless transition. We will miss David, and he has been such an important and intricate part of our executive team. We are pleased to announce that as part of this transition, Bary Bailey is joining the AMN team as our Chief Financial Officer. Bary brings nearly 30 years of experience in finance and operations in healthcare, insurance and pharmaceuticals industries. He was most recently CFO at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Earlier in his career, he also served as CFO of Premier [Premier Healthcare], one of the largest healthcare group purchasing organizations in the U.S. We believe Bary's is expertise in healthcare industry, as well as his passion for strategic differentiation will add significant value to the entire organization. Now, back to our outlook. Going into the third quarter, Nursing and Allied order levels are still significantly lower than prior year, but are showing signs of improvement. At the beginning of the third quarter, our traveler count was still feeling the effects of the drop in demand earlier in the year, but that should come to an end soon. With the stabilization in order since April and the trailing off of assignments, we expect to now see traveler count volume bottom out during the third quarter. Our traveler count volume will be slightly lower than otherwise normal due to the expected short term traveler attrition associated with our brand and office consolidations. Our experience is that these short-term losses usually recovered in a couple of quarters. In Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement, early indicators for days available and surgeons are expected to be up slightly. However, due to the lag time for placements, we anticipate third quarter aggregate volumes will be flat on a sequential basis. Pricing continues to be stable across most of our business lines, helping to maintain growth margins. On a consolidated basis, we are anticipating third-quarter revenue to decline by approximately 15% on a sequential basis, driven primarily by the volume declines in nursing. As I hope you've learned from our comments today, we remain very focused on four key aspects of our strategy. First, continuing to leverage the advantages of our industry-leading position, our strong sales force and diverse client base, and aggressively pursuing preferred provider relationships; second, our focus and progress in growing new service offerings; third, our disciplined approach to improving our cost structure to deliver consistent profitability margins, and better leveraging the company's operating model as the market rebounds; and fourth, the prudent management of our balance sheet and significant reduction in debt, which positions us to invest in future market expansion that will drive long-term growth, and contribute strategic synergies to our core service lines. These key initiatives enable us to address today's challenging environment and deliver consistent margins in the short-term, while at the same time, position us for long-term growth and expansion of our market leadership position. And with that, I would now like to open up the call for questions."
56,GV_144520_2010Q2,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AMN Healthcare Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Amy Chang. Please go ahead. Amy Chang Good morning, everyone. Welcome to AMN Healthcare's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Call. A replay of this webcast will be available at amnhealthcare.com\investors and will be available until August 19, 2010. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward- looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, and other periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate the opportunity to share more details with you regarding the important announcements that we made yesterday, our agreement to acquire Medfinders and our results for the second quarter and outlook for the third quarter. These are all positive news events for AMN. Here with me today is Bary Bailey, who I'm sure you all know as our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining today is Bob Livonius, the CEO of Medfinders; and Ralph Henderson, the President of AMN's Nurse and Allied Staffing Divisions. We thought it would be helpful for them to be available for your questions regarding the strategic combination of our organizations and the benefits that we expect to bring to our clients. As we address your questions though, please keep in mind that we are still in the early integration planning stages and the deal will not close for several weeks, so we will not be able to provide any details regarding integration plans. Yesterday, after the close of the market, AMN Healthcare announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Medfinders, a privately owned diversified healthcare staffing company with particular expertise and market leadership in providing managed services programs to healthcare facilities. This acquisition is a natural step in our long-term growth strategy as it directly contributes to our objective of delivering greater value and innovative workforce solutions to our clients. The combination also strengthens our capabilities in existing businesses and enables us to expand into Home Health services. Because of the complementary nature of our business models, we will also be able to achieve immediate sales and operating efficiencies. Based on the current state of our industry and the projected future growing needs of our clients, we believe this is the perfect addition to AMN to enhance long-term shareholder value. Medfinders is the number one clinical managed services provider for hospitals in the U.S. Their next largest businesses are travel allied staffing, local nurse staffing and home health services. Similar to AMN, they also provide travel nurse staffing, locum tenens and physician permanent placement. These are all businesses that build on or complement our current service offerings and extend our reach. By increasing our presence and capabilities in the managed services space, AMN can become an even better partner to our clients who are looking to increase their revenue and operational efficiency. We continue to experience an increased interest from healthcare facilities and systems who prefer to establish long-term relationship with one organization to outsource their supplemental staffing and permanent recruitment needs. Currently, Medfinders provide MSP services to over 90 healthcare systems at over 300 facility sites. These types of client relationships typically experience higher fill rates and create a more recurring and predictable revenue stream over time. We also anticipate the addition of Medfinders' local staffing capabilities will create revenue synergies as AMN will be able to fill the daily and local contract staffing needs of our existing clients. This is incremental revenue opportunity for AMN since today, we do not have the capabilities to directly provide quick response local staff to our clients. In addition to the current client benefits, the combined strength of our MSP platforms and our fulfillment capabilities will no doubt resonate positively with healthcare facilities who are contemplating moving to MSP arrangements in the future. Medfinders generated approximately $300 million in revenues during 2009. The revenue mix consisted of 36% in MSP-related and traditional local staffing, 32% in MSP-related and traditional travel staffing and 11% in physician staffing and permanent placement services. Home Health services comprised 21% of the revenue. We like the fact that this acquisition gives us an entry into home healthcare, which is very much aligned with our long-term strategy of extending into adjacent services in growth segments of the healthcare services industry. Home healthcare is viewed as an attractive solution to the cost pressures felt by hospitals and payers as they aim to provide quality post-acute care in a lower-cost setting. Home health is significantly less expensive than hospital or skilled nursing facility care and is often preferred by the patients as well. Acute- care facilities are also recognizing their need to partner with organizations to effectively transition their discharged patients into a quality home health environment in order to improve outcomes and avoid readmission. The industry is very fragmented today and is expected to grow over 5% annually, becoming a $94 billion industry by 2015. The Medfinders Home Care division currently has 20 offices in 10 states, which serves approximately 35% of the nation's elderly population. AMN has been focused on growing our presence in synergistic patient care environments and outsourced clinical workforce solutions. Recent examples have been our organic launch into recruitment process outsourcing and our managed services offering. We expect to continue our strategy of innovation by building on our traditional core staffing lines, newer service offerings such as MSP, RPO and Home Health, and potentially extending even further into new areas, which are more physician-centric. These strategic initiatives will continue to fuel future growth while diversifying our revenue and earnings. They will also create more recurring revenue streams and mitigate our sensitivity to economic fluctuations. As many of you know, AMN has a proven track record of successfully integrating new acquisitions. We will continue this discipline of integrating and streamlining our newly combined organization in order to achieve sales and operational synergies. At the same time, we want to continue to build on the strength of the well-respected and established brands of our two organizations. Where appropriate, we will leverage our combined resources and capabilities. We will have much more to share with you regarding integration on our next earnings call. Medfinders has a proven and experienced leadership team, and we are thrilled to have the opportunity to build a stronger organization together. I've known Bob Livonius for over seven years and have great respect for his strategic vision and positioning of Medfinders as an industry leader. In particular, Bob's early and innovative approach to vendor management and Nursefinders' MSP offering helped prove the value of this service to many healthcare facilities across the country. Today, they proudly lead the industry in MSP. Like the AMN Healthcare team, Medfinders is also a thought leader in the industry and is sought out by healthcare organizations to continue improving their quality and cost effectiveness. Most importantly, they put the clients' needs first. This is a core value of AMN Healthcare as well. The commonality of integrity, values, management philosophy and just the sheer talent of the combined teams gives me great confidence in our ability to successfully integrate these two organizations. We'll be opening up the call later to answer questions, and at that time, I'll invite Bob and Ralph to share more insights with you regarding their perspective on our combination. But first, Bary and I would like to give you an update on our second quarter operating results and business trends. We're pleased to report that second quarter consolidated revenues were up sequentially by 4%, which exceeded our previous expectations of 1% to 3% growth. This represented the first sequential quarterly growth in consolidated revenues that we have seen in seven quarters. We believe this is a good indication of the beginning of a modest, steady market recovery in our industry. The sequential increase was driven primarily by increases in our Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement businesses, with our Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue holding steady during the quarter. In the second quarter, the Nurse and Allied business generated $76 million in revenues, which was flat compared with prior quarter. The business saw flat sequential volumes as a result of order levels staying above prior year but still at relatively low levels. Despite this, we continue to secure a larger portion of the available jobs due to our managed services and preferred clients, and we improved fill rates. Revenue per traveler per day continues to be stable due primarily to relatively flat bill rates. During the last three months, the aggregate number of assignment orders and the number of facility units with orders have increased across the country, reflecting a modest but still healthy rise in demand. Our Locum Tenens segment delivered second quarter revenues of $65 million, which was 8% higher than last quarter. Days filled volumes increased by 8%, which had increases across all specialties, and the strongest gains were in surgery, behavioral health and primary care. Days sold, which is our best indicator of future placement opportunities, was also sequentially higher, with particular strength in primary care, anesthesia and surgery. Gross margins remained steady compared to prior quarter and prior year. In Physician Permanent Placement, second quarter revenues were $8.3 million, which was 8% higher than the prior quarter. The sequential improvement was due to increases in both placements and activity on new searches. As we mentioned in the previous call, we've been experiencing a greater number of larger, multi-search arrangements, which create a good long-term revenue opportunity. We are starting to see some of these searches become active, which certainly helped in our sequential volume improvement. One of our greatest challenges facing us today is hiring and training new recruiters to help fill the growing number of search opportunities. We are making progress in our new recruitment hires but are still lagging the growth in active searches. As we enter into the third quarter, the company continues to stay focused on everyday execution in order to capture as much market share as possible as we enter this phase of modest recovery. At the same time, we are capitalizing on opportunistic acquisitions, which position us well strategically, both in the short and long term. Combining with Medfinders is very much in line with the four key strategic areas we have been focused on. First, AMN's efforts to win preferred provider and managed services contracts will be significantly bolstered by Medfinders' leadership position in this space. Medfinders' Local Staffing business also provides a stronger platform for us to serve our clients more fully. This combined managed services platform will give us even more upside opportunity as we emerge into a more robust market. Second, the ongoing investments in new services we have made over the past two years have set us up for stronger growth and more diversified revenue stream in the long term. Medfinders' Home Health division represents a new market opportunity in a relatively fragmented industry that is supported by the long-term growth dynamics of an aging population and increasing demand for healthcare services. Third, joining forces with another leading company will enable us to share, implement and leverage best practices across both organizations. This creates additional opportunity for further operating leverage and an agile organization with the ability to support product development and other future growth initiative. And fourth, we have been able to structure this acquisition in a way that retains the financial health of our balance sheet and capital structure. Consistent with our track record, we intend to continue closely managing our profitability, cash flow and debt structure. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bary Bailey, our CFO, who will provide an overview of the transaction and more detail on our second quarter results and financial position. After which, we will comment on the business outlook going into the third quarter, and then, we will open up the call to your questions. Bary? Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. With respect to the transaction under the terms of the agreement, AMN will acquire all of the outstanding equity of Medfinders' parent company in exchange for approximately 6.3 million shares of AMN Healthcare Services common stock and approximately 5.7 million shares of preferred securities, with a liquidation preference of $10 per share. Initially, the preferred securities will bear a dividend rate of 11%. Subsequent to the completion of the transaction, AMN expects to file a proxy statement with the SEC to obtain shareholder approval to convert the non-voting preferred securities held by the Medfinders shareholders into voting preferred secured shares convertible into AMN Healthcare common stock on a 1- for-1 basis. Assuming shareholder approval within six months of the transaction closing, the accrual of any dividend will be waived, and no further dividend will accrue on those securities. To refinance AMN's existing Term B facility of approximately $107 million and pay off Medfinders' existing debt totaling approximately $132 million, AMN expects to amend and extend its current Term B loan and increase its balance by an estimated $68 million to $175 million and issue a second lien of $50 million. Assuming the value of all of the issued equity securities using the closing share price from the close of business on Tuesday, the 27th, and the shareholder approval of the conversion features of the preferred securities and attributing no value for the liquidation preference, the transaction has a value of approximately $220 million. Upon completion of the transaction, the selling Medfinders shareholders will own approximately 26% of AMN's fully diluted shares in an as-converted basis. Medfinders generated approximately $20 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2009. We expect their 2010 adjusted EBITDA will be down approximately 10%, reflecting the industry declines occurring in 2009, although Medfinders still fared better than most companies over the last 18 months. We anticipate the combination will generate annualized synergies in excess of $10 million, and assuming that amortization will track consistently with past experience, we expect the transaction to be accretive to full year earnings in 2011. We will also receive tax benefits from NOLs and other tax attributes that have a present value of approximately $20 million. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2010 and will be subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approval and debt refinancing. At this time, I will turn to our second quarter performance. Susan just provided us with an overview of the top line performance for the second quarter, which exceeded the revenue guidance we provided in the last quarter's earnings call. Overall, gross margin in the quarter continued to hold up well, although slightly down compared to last quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2009, we saw a 60 basis point improvement to 27.6%. The margin increase from last year was due to continued gross margin improvement in our Nurse and Allied segment and by a higher-margin Physician Permanent Placement segment representing a greater portion of our business mix. As I just mentioned, we did see a decrease of 30 basis points as compared to the previous quarter due primarily to higher health insurance expense in the Nurse and Allied segment. We continue to see a high utilization of COBRA due to the current government subsidy program. COBRA represented approximately 40% of claims in the second quarter, and we had a high number of large claims impacting our experience. We continue to monitor this, and over time, we expect our number of COBRA participants to decline. As we look at the rest of the year, we see margins holding steady with potential for modest improvement from continued management of compensation packages. As we are all aware, throughout last year, the company took significant steps to streamline the organization and improve overall operating structure of the company in order to achieve sustained efficiency. Excluding external direct costs associated with due diligence and negotiating the transaction, second quarter SG&A expenses would have been $33.5 million or 12% lower than last year. Adjusted for the transaction-related expenses, second quarter SG&A expenses were up 5% compared to the first quarter but as a percentage of revenues, right in line. Our Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 1% while travel count volume decreased by 1%. Nurse and Allied gross margin in the second quarter was 25.5%, 50 basis points higher than the same period in 2009, but 80 basis points lower than last quarter due to the increase in healthcare costs I've previously mentioned. Segment operating income for the second quarter was $7.3 million, reflecting the expected decline compared to last year. Nurse and Allied operating income in the second quarter is also lower than the first quarter due primarily to malpractice insurance adjustments and the impact to operating income of the increased healthcare costs mentioned earlier. We do not expect the impact of the insurance adjustments to continue into next quarter, but as previously mentioned, we do expect to add some resources as we continue to see growth in volume. The Locum Tenens segment experienced sequential revenue growth of 8%. Days filled increased by 8% sequentially, and gross margin held steady sequentially at about 26.2%. The operating margin for the second quarter was 9.8%, which was up 70 basis points compared to the previous quarter. SG&A costs held steady compared to the prior quarter, providing leverage on the increased gross profit. Compared to last year, the operating margin decreased due to the favorable professional liability reserve adjustment we reported last year at this time. Within our Physician Permanent Placement segment, revenue grew sequentially by 8%. Physician Permanent Placement operating income for the second quarter was $2 million, in line with the first quarter. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation in the second quarter, was $7 million, as compared to $5.6 million in the prior year and $5.7 million in the prior quarter. The increases compared to prior quarter is due almost entirely to costs incurred associated with the Medfinders transaction for legal, accounting and operational due diligence and planning for integration. Given our low pretax income in the quarter, expenses such as the transaction-related expenses have a significant impact to our effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of transaction-related expenses in the rate determination, our annual effective rate would be approximately 55%, and the rate in the quarter would be approximately 57%, which is lower than discussed in the last call. As our pretax income increases over time, the impact of such items will have less of an impact to our rate. As we have indicated before, our actual cash tax rate has been trending in the low 40s range. In the second quarter, we generated $6.8 million of operating cash flow, of which about $1.4 million went to reduce debt. Days sales outstanding were 55 days as compared to 56 last quarter. We continue to closely manage capital expenditures without limiting important investments. Capital expenditures for the first quarter were about $600,000. We will continue to manage capital expenditures but do expect them to increase as we look forward to the integration of Medfinders. As of June 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $41.4 million and our total term debt outstanding was $107 million, with no borrowings under the revolver. I will now return the call back to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you very much, Bary. In our last two earnings calls, we have been predicting that 2010 would be a period of stabilization and then modest growth. This continues to be our outlook today. While our market is still constrained, our teams are performing extremely well, and their steadfast commitment to execution and building stronger and deeper client relationships is being rewarded by the clients. Going into the third quarter, we anticipate Nurse and Allied Travel volumes will be up sequentially based on slightly stronger order and placement levels in June and July. We are also anticipating Locum Tenens to again show sequential volume and revenue increases based on growth in days sold and days filled in the second quarter. Our Physician Perm [Permanent] Placement business is also expecting modest sequential improvement as a result of our volume of active searches and expected increases in placements. Based on these factors, third quarter consolidated revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6% compared to the prior quarter, and this excludes the impact of any acquisitions. I believe there is little doubt that the long-term drivers of healthcare services and staffing remain quite strong. However, the short-term demand environment is still constrained by general economic uncertainty and high unemployment. During this time, we believe AMN can further differentiate our leadership position by remaining laser focused on execution in our core existing businesses, while at the same time, expanding our capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our clients. Our acquisition of Medfinders further expands the differentiated value, breadth and depth of services we are able to offer to healthcare clients today. And with that, we would now like to open up the call for your questions."
57,GV_144520_2011Q2,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AMN Healthcare Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. And later, we will conduct a question- and-answer session. The instructions will be given at that time.

Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may, and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements.

The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. On the call today are Susan Salka our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Brian Scott, our Chief Financial Officer. Joining us during the Q&A session will be Ralph Henderson, our President of Nurse and Allied staffing and Bob Livonius, our President of Workforce Solutions. I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you so much Amy. Good afternoon and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s 2011 second quarter earnings conference call. We are continuing to experience a steady recovery and are pleased to report our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Customer demand continues to pick up in our largest businesses of nurse staffing and locum tenens and the benefits of our enhanced value proposition are resonating well with existing and new clients. As a result, we are seeing continued momentum in building both our MSP and traditional clientele. While top-line growth is progressing we have experienced some headwinds in our direct costs, such as higher apartment rents, travel expenses due to fuel costs and some increases in clinician compensation packages. We anticipate these margin pressures to continue at this level for the foreseeable future, but we are making progress in reversing these trends through bill rate increases and tighter management of our direct costs. While placement volumes rose in the second quarter, we were able to hold SG&A relatively steady, which enabled us to experience some modest improvement in operating leverage. Now, let’s get into some of our trends in the financial performance. Overall, consolidated revenues for the second quarter were $235 million, up 2% sequentially and 57% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, consolidated revenues were up 10% over prior year. In addition to our top-line performance, we were able to leverage our infrastructure and the cost savings from the acquisition to further reduce SG&A as a percentage of revenues. With gross margins of 27.7%, we were able to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $15 million and a margin of 6.5%. Second quarter nurse and allied revenues were $140 million, up 4% sequentially. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our largest business segment and further grows our market position in this segment where we are more than twice the size of our largest competitor. It’s also noteworthy, since the second quarter is typically sequentially down in this segment. Year-over-year revenues were up 85% on an as-reported basis, and up 20% on a pro forma basis. This growth was driven mainly by the travel nurse business where revenues were up 5% sequentially and 36% year-over-year. The volume growth occurred at both MSP and traditional clients. Travel nurse order levels have been increasing for well over a year now and have generally been running more than 75% above prior year. As we saw orders jump in the second half of 2010, we may see this gap narrow a little bit later this year. Demand is rising at both MSP clients, as well as at our traditional clients. In June, the number of facilities with travel nurse orders was up over 40% with last year. The growth in orders is also geographically dispersed, with our top five states spanning the West, the Northwest, Northeast, the Southeast and the South. Another good sign for the next few quarters is that we have already begun to receive a significant number of winter orders for some of our larger clients. We continue to be successful in winning new MSP contracts. During the last 12 months, we have been awarded 30 new MSP contracts adding approximately 75 million and annualized gross spend under management. We had a particularly strong second quarter adding 10 new contracts. And some of these MSP clients, we’ve replaced an incumbent provider. These wins are recognition by clients of our stronger value proposition and continued validation that AMN and Medfinders, are truly better together. Another validation we recently received is the prestigious peer review designation by the Healthcare Financial Management Association. The HFMA is a highly recognized association that supports healthcare CFO. This objective evaluation of our MSP program consisted of a rigorous multi step review and was based on our proven effectiveness, our quality, value and customer support. We are excited to be the only MSP provider in our industry to receive this designation. Our local staffing offices continue to be a key part of our success in winning and filling MSP business. Second quarter revenues for local staffing were $24 million, which was up 3% sequentially and 7% over prior year. Although demand trends in local staffing are generally increasing, they are less consistent across different regions and there are challenges in recruiting supply in certain markets. For both travel and local nurse staffing supply is becoming an increasing constraint to meet the raising demand. While we do have an advantage in the market with our substantial candidate database, we are also making incremental investments in Canada marketing to target additional supply. Second quarter Allied revenue was $29 million, which was up 1% both sequentially and year-over-year on a pro forma basis. This slower growth was due mainly to the disruption of the allied integration in April. With that integration now behind us and complete, we are already experiencing improved performance in this business and expect to deliver stronger growth in the second half of the year. Recently, there has been a pick up in imaging, respiratory and lab demand, but a slight slow down in rehab therapy demand. Our locum tenens segment delivered second quarter revenues up $71 million, up 1% sequentially. Year- over-year revenues were up 9% on a as reported basis and down 2% on a pro forma basis. The greatest sequential volume improvement we experienced was in our largest specialty of primary care. The other specialties were relatively steady with the exception of anesthesia, which experienced a volume decline. While we might see this type of quarterly volatility in some specialties, we anticipate continued modest improvement in the overall locum tenens business. A good indicator of this future growth is our days sold, which continued to tick-up modestly in the second quarter. Year-over-year, pricing remained stable in this business with the exception of radiology, which declined. To further endorse our commitment to providing quality physicians, AMN recently applied for and was awarded certification status as a credentials verification organization with the national committee for quality assurance. The NCQA certification assures clients that our credentialing processes are consistent with the highest standards of physician and practitioner credentialing in the industry. It also allows our clients to reduce their workload when bringing an AMN physician into their organization. We expect that this designation will open some new doors for us as some locum buyers will give preference to NCQA certified providers. In physician permanent placement second quarter revenues were $9 million, down 13% sequentially. Without the impact of the deferred revenue accounting changes, which were implemented in the first quarter, revenues would have been flat with the prior quarter. The physicians search market has been steady, but is still not growing while hospitals are hiring more physicians many of them have significantly increased their internal recruiting resources. We are beginning to see more openness recently in conversations with hospital systems that have grown impatient with their internal recruiting results. We are also seeing some success in offering alternative service relationships where we work in more of a partnership with the internal recruitment team. In the second quarter, revenues from home healthcare services were $14 million representing a 2% sequential increase and a 9% year-over-year decrease. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by volume increases. Our average episodic rate for Medicare was flat with the last quarter, but was down 9% year-over-year, due to the reimbursement rate and coding changes that went into effect on January 1. Although Medicare represents less than 20% of our total home healthcare revenues, the rate in coding reductions and the new face-to-face requirements are still challenging to the business. At the state level, we’ve also experienced some Medicaid rate pressures. Nevertheless, we anticipate that revenues will remain stable going into the third quarter and in the long- term, we continue to take step to grow our Medicare and private pay businesses as these typically still have higher growth and EBITDA margins. With penalties for the readmissions beginning in October 2012 and the planning for ACOs, hospitals are more focused than ever on reducing re-admissions. We believe in the long run home healthcare will play an increasingly important role in these efforts. As we approach the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of Medfinders, I can’t help but think what a difference a year makes. During the last year we have experienced significant improvement in our larger business segments. Clients are rewarding our commitment and superior offering with increased market share and we have proven the tangible benefits of the Medfinders acquisition. As we reported last quarter, we are ahead of schedule in achieving the 10 million in annualized EBITDA synergies from the acquisition. Going in to the third quarter with the underlying market improving and the integration of Medfinders complete, we are able to focus even more attention and resources on everyday execution to maximize volume and profitability in the improved demand environment. Longer term as lower reimbursement levels and mounting costs continue to pressure hospital operating margins, providers are seeking strong partners and innovative approaches to their care delivery and business processes. With clinical wages representing on average 40% of hospital revenues our clients are looking for ways to flex and more tightly manage their workforce. As a leader and primary innovator in healthcare staffing and workforce solutions, AMN is well-positioned to help our clients achieve their financial, quality, and patient goals. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I would like to thank our key members for their tremendous efforts over the past year to help us further build our position as the leader in healthcare staffing and workforce solutions. I will come back to you in our Q&A section to help further answer your questions, but for now I will turn the call over to our CFO, Brian Scott. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you Susan and good afternoon everyone. As Susan mentioned, second quarter revenue was $234.5 million. Our gross margin for the quarter was 27.7%, up 10 basis points from last year, but down 190 basis points from last quarter. The sequential decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a first quarter $1.9 million Workers' Compensation actuarial benefit. The gross margin was also impacted by the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard and our physician permanent placement segment, which added $2.1 million of revenue in the first quarter and $700,000 of revenue in the second quarter. SG&A in the quarter totaled $52.6 million, which included $1.2 million of costs associated with the integration of Medfinders. Excluding integration expenses, SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 21.9% decreased in the prior year by 50 basis points and sequentially by 60 basis points. We accomplished the majority of our cost synergy efforts by the end of the second quarter and the improved SG&A percentage in part reflected these efforts and our ability to leverage our infrastructure as revenue grows. We are prudently adding team members, primarily in sales and operation in connection with growth and travel nursing and the implementation and ongoing support of new MSP contracts, as well as increasing our investment in targeted marketing programs to add supply to meet growing demands. During the third quarter, we also reinstated merit increases for the majority of our team members. Therefore in the second half of the year, we expect SG&A to grow in absolute dollars, but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue. Our Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 4% to $140 million. Volume grew 2% sequentially to 5,200 healthcare professionals and revenue per day was up sequentially on slightly higher bill rates and a favorable staffing mix, offset partly by lower hours worked. Nurse and allied gross margin decreased sequentially by 170 basis points to 25.8%, due mainly to the first quarter workers’ compensation actuarial adjustment, most of which benefitted this segment, as well as higher health insurance costs in the second quarter. Second quarter nurse and allied segment operating income was $14.4 million or 10.3% of revenue, as compared to $15.1 million or 11.2% of revenue in the prior quarter. The operating margin improved by 70 basis points year-over-year, due in large part to the cost synergies from integrating the Medfinders travel nurse and allied businesses and improved operating leverage. Included in the nurse and allied segment is our O’Grady Peyton International division, which currently represents less than 1% of consolidated revenue. Although the primary business of this division has been and will continue to be the placement of foreign trained healthcare professionals into opportunities in the U.S. we also have a small office in the U.K. that provides direct placement services in foreign market. Due to lower client demand and poor financial performance, we are in the process of closing this U.K. office, which will have an impact on both revenue and SG&A and reduce third quarter EBITDA by approximately 600,000. Our locum tenens segment revenue increased by 1% from the prior quarter reflecting a 3% increase in days sales, probably offset by a decrease in our revenue per days sales. Gross margin of 25.5% was down by 70 basis points in the prior year from pressure on the pay bill spread in certain specialties, partially offset by the addition of the higher margin Medfinders locums business. The gross margin was sequentially lowered by 70 basis points due to a high margin staffing project with a single client during the previous quarter. Locums operating income of $5.5 million or 7.7% of revenues compares to $6 million or 8.6% in the prior quarter with the decline related to the change in gross margin. Within our physician permanent placement segment, revenue declined sequentially by 13%, due to the previously noted adoption of a new revenue recognition standard effective on January 1. We recognized approximately $2.1 million of revenue in the first quarter and $700,000 in the second quarter that would have been deferred under the old standards. Excluding the impact of this change, revenue increased year-over-year by 5%, due to the addition of Medfinders and was consistent with the prior quarter. Physician permanent placement operating income for the second quarter was $2.5 million or 26.5% of revenue. Our home healthcare segment generated revenue of $13.9 million and operating income $0.4 million for the quarter. Gross margin in this business was 34.5% for the quarter, a decrease of 360 basis points in the prior quarter, due primarily to the workers compensation benefit recorded in the first quarter. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation and integration expenses in the second quarter was $7.5 million, a slight decrease in the preceding quarter of $7.7 million and higher than the prior expense of $5.9 million. The increase compared to the prior year is due to the addition of Metfinders. Our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was 69%, which reflects the true-up of our tax expense for the full-year projected tax rate of approximately 60% to 62%. This is higher than the previously estimated full-year tax rate, due in part to the decision to close our U.K. office, which limits the deductibility of losses in this operation, as well as cost associated with amending our credit agreement. We still anticipate that our full-year cash tax rate will be in the 20% range. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $800,000 or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding integration cost, adjusted earnings per share was $0.03. Second quarter operating cash flow was $2.4 million. Days sales outstanding were 54 days unchanged from last quarter. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $800,000. As of June 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $7.9 million and our total debt outstanding under our credit agreement net of discount was $215.8 million. As I mentioned on July 25, we executed an amendment to our credit agreement to increase our revolver from $40 million to $50 million and adjust certain financial covenants to maximize our operating flexibility for the longer term. As a result of the amendment, the company incurred fees of approximately $2 million, the majority of which are expected to be charged through interest expense in the third quarter. Going into the third quarter, the nurse and allied staffing segment continues to experience positive momentum with 2% to 4% sequential revenue growth anticipated. Travel nurse, allied and local staffing are all expected to contribute to this growth. The travel nurse volume is again expected to be above our prior year pro forma levels by more than 30%. Locum tenens segment revenue is expected to increase 3% to 5% sequentially. Physician permanent placement revenues are anticipated to be stable. And home healthcare services segment revenues are expected to be up 1% to 3%. On a consolidated basis, third quarter revenues are expected to be between $241 million and $245 million. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27% and 27.5%, SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately 22% of revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to be approximately 6%. There are no material changes to the annual financial estimates we provided earlier in the year for depreciation, amortization, share account our capital expenditures. And with that we’d like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you so much, Amy. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s 2012 Second Quarter Earnings conference call. As we passed the midpoint of 2012, we are pleased to report solid performance with second quarter revenue, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA margin all exceeding the company’s guidance. These results reflect the outstanding efforts of our team and everyday execution in our core staffing businesses as well as our continued progress as the innovator and health care workforce solutions. In the second quarter, we saw a sequential revenue growth and gross margin improvement across all business segments. This is a good inductor of an improving market and demand trends. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $236 million exceeded our guidance range and was up 7% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We also achieved a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7% which was better than anticipated. Consolidated gross margins were 28.4%, higher than our expectations and higher than prior year and quarter. Our performance was driven by several key factors. First it is clear that the evolving sophistication of our clients is translating into greater differentiation of our capabilities in the market. While AMN has long been recognized as the leader in traditional health care staffing, we are now also recognized as the leader and innovator in delivering workforce solutions. The strategic workforce solutions we provide include: managed services programs, recruitment process outsourcing, electronic medical records, implementation staffing and other workforce consulting services. These enable clients to manage their clinical talent pool and provide better patient care at a lower cost. In the second quarter, approximately 1/3 of our Nurse and Allied revenue was from MSP clients who are relying upon us to manage and fill their clinical staffing needs. This MSP model is already migrating into advanced practice and the physician space as well. In the second quarter, we continued to win new MSP and RPO contracts due to the strength of our offering and our ability to deliver higher fill rates to our clients. In a recent staffing industry analyst report, AMN Healthcare was named the nation's top healthcare MSP provider with 3x the gross spend under management as the next largest clinical staffing company in this space. A second key contributor to our strengthening results is our constant focus on every day execution, coupled with investments in our future. Our integration activities last year and the improved gross margin management have begun paying off, as we continue to experience operating leverage through revenue growth. At the same time, we're making investments in marketing spend and building innovative recruitment approaches to drive more candidate supply. We feel quite confident in the demand growth expected over the next few years and we believe these increased investments are needed to ensure that we have the quality and the quantity of clinicians available for our clients. Despite this slightly higher level of SG&A spending from these initiatives, we still anticipate continuing to improve operating leverage and we believe we're on track to achieve our 10% adjusted EBITDA margin target. Now, let's turn to our results by business segment. Second quarter Nurse and Allied revenue was $159 million, up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. This growth was slightly better than expected driven mainly by the Travel Nurse business, where revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The growth was driven by strong fill rates, rebook rates and an increased supply of nurse applicants. While orders were softer at the beginning of the year, in the second quarter, they grew consistently and today orders are up slightly year-over-year. The stronger demand was nationwide and came from both MSP and traditional client accounts. Clients with orders and clients with clinicians on assignment, were also both up year-over-year and sequentially which is always a good sign of a healthier client and order base. Going in to the third quarter, July orders are up in the double-digits over the second quarter, and we expect to see our third quarter Traveler count volume up in the mid-teens year-over-year. Now turning to local staffing. Second quarter revenue was down 11% compared to prior year and 1% sequentially. Revenue was impacted from the lower demand in certain markets as well as candidate supply constraints and the disruption from operational changes. As planned, our New York office opened in April and our Philadelphia office recently opened to support 2 large MSP clients we implemented during the last year. Second quarter Allied revenue was up 14% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. The growth was experienced in our therapy business as well as the imaging, respiratory and lab specialties. The Allied team continues to invest in marketing spend to drive more candidate supply. They also continue to experience strong rebook rates and improvement in sales productivity. In July, order levels have remained relatively steady and we anticipate third quarter revenue to grow modestly on a sequential basis and at mid-single-digits year-over-year. Locum Tenens second quarter revenue was $68 million, down 5% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. This year-over-year decline was due mainly to continued volume and pricing decreases in radiology. Without radiology, segment revenue would have been roughly flat. The sequential growth is the strongest that we've seen in 2 years and was due to improvements in both volume and bill rates. The sequential volume increase was due to higher days filled with behavioral health, ER and anesthesia. Second quarter Locums gross margin improved by 240 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis points sequentially. This was due primarily to improve bill rates and bill to pay spread resulting from the margin enhancement changes we put into place at the end of last year. Days sold in the second quarter were sequentially flat and going into the third quarter overall Locums revenue is expected to flat sequentially and down year- over-year in the mid-single-digits. We believe our Locums business has significantly more opportunity for improvement in volumes, pricing and margin management. The team is making good steady progress towards our target of a double-digit EBITDA margin for this segment. Over the past 2 years physicians have been swiftly moving over to the hospital employment model and we may be seeing some signs of the dust settling as more hospital facilities begin to have a higher level of ongoing replacement, recruitment and coverage needs for physicians who leave or are on vacation. To this point, the demand for hospitalist, ER physicians and other hospital based specialties has been rising at a faster pace. In physician improvement and placement, second quarter revenue was $10 million, up 1% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The growth in the second quarter was due mainly to higher placements from the increase in new searches. In the second quarter new searches were up sequentially with the largest increase being in family practice. However, some of these contracts certain a larger number of searches which are activated over a longer period of time and have less near-term impact on placements. As a result, we are conservatively anticipating our third quarter position from revenue to be flat sequentially. Over the next few years demand for both traditional, health care recruitment and staffing and innovative work force solutions is expected to grow significantly. Every week new articles are published about the severe shortages that are anticipated in the nursing, physician and allied professions. The shortages will be fueled by the ageing clinical labor force which will begin retiring in greater numbers. At the same time, demand for health care services will accelerate due to the broader access to health insurance and the growing medical needs of the ageing population. In anticipation of these looming, severe shortages and the impacts of health care reform, health care executives more than ever are looking for new innovative solutions to deal with their challenges of delivering excellent patient care at a lower cost. As a result, they are seeking highly capable partners who they can collaborate with and trust to deliver on their core staffing needs and develop new solutions. AMN has a proven track record of delivering in this more demanding and differentiated market. Our strategy is clear and it seems to be right in line with what our clients need and want from a workforce partner. We will also continue to evolve and invest in opportunities that will enable AMN to be a valuable partner for our clients in the future as their operating models continue to shift. The solid results we are reporting today and the continued progress on our work force solution strategy is a direct reflection of our standing team. Every team member at AMN has an impact on our ability to help our clients and clinicians achieve their goals. I would like to recognize and thank our team members for their continued solid execution and passion for delivering excellence. It is this level of talent and engagement combined with our clear differentiated strategy that has set us apart in the marketplace and ultimately enables to deliver more shareholder value. I will come back to you in our Q&A session along with Ralph and Bob to help answer your questions. But for now I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $235.8 million up 6.9% from last year and 4.1% from last quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.4% up a 110 basis points from last year and up 50 basis points from last quarter. The year-over-year and sequential increase was due to improvements and bill to pay spread in both the Locum Tenens and Nurse and Allied segments significantly more than offsetting direct cost pressures from higher housing rent and travel costs. SG&A in the quarter totaled $50.3 million or 21.3% of revenue, compared to 21.8% in the same quarter last year and 20.8% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year improvement was due to the absence of integration related expenses and improved SG&A leverage, partly offset by higher professional liability cost and increased spending on candidate supply and workforce solutions initiatives. The sequential increase resulted from the prior quarter including the $2 million refund received from the California Employment Development Department, more than offsetting the operating leverage improvement. We expect total SG&A expenses in the third quarter to increase sequentially by about $1 million driven in part by investments being made in our strategic workforce solutions and new recruitment and candidate supply initiatives. Our nurse and allied segment revenue increased 13.3% from the prior year and sequentially by 3.1% to $158.6 million. Volume grew 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially to 5,592 average health care professionals on assignment. Revenue per day was up 5% year-over-year and less than 1% sequentially on higher bill rates and a year-over-year increase in hours worked. Nurse and Allied gross margin increased year-over-year by 90 basis points and sequentially by 30 basis points to 26.7%, with improved bill-to-pay spread exceeding the higher housing costs. Second quarter Nurse and Allied operating income was $18.4 million or $11.6% of revenue. The operating margin was 130 basis points higher than the prior year and 50 basis points higher than prior quarter from the improved gross margin and SG&A leverage. Our Locum Tenens segment of revenue of $67.6 million was 4.9% below prior year but was up 6.4% from the prior quarter. With a sequential increase reflecting a 1.7% increase in day sold and 4.7% in revenue per day per sold on higher average bill rates. Gross margin at 27.9% was up 240 basis points from the prior year. And sequentially by 80 basis points due primarily to improve the bill-to-pay spreads. Our Locum Tenens segment reported an operating income of $6.1 million or 9% of revenue, 130 basis points higher than prior year and 200 basis points better than prior quarter. Within our physician permanent placement segment revenue increased year-over-year by 1.1% and sequentially by 6.2%. Excluding the prior year adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, revenue was up year-over-year by 10% on growth in new searches and placement. Physician Permanent Placement operating income for the second quarter was $1.9 million or 19.7% of revenue. Interest expense in the quarter included the writeoff of $8.6 million of non-cash deferred financing and original issue discount and a $1.2 million prepayment penalty associated with extinguishing the previous credit facilities. Excluding these debt refinancing costs, interest expense in the quarter was $3.8 million, which compares to $5.5 million last quarter and $5.6 million last year. For the third quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $3.9 million. Our tax rate in the quarter, tax in the quarter was 83% which was significantly impacted by the year-to-date tax rate against the small pre-tax loss. Excluding the impact of the debt refinancing, our second quarter and full-year projected tax rate is approximately 45%, which is lower than our previous estimate of about 50%. Our total cash taxes paid this year are expected to be $1 million to $2 million, resulting in a cash tax rate of less than 10%, due in large parts continued utilization of tax benefits from the Medfinders acquisitions. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.0 for the second quarter. Excluding the impact of the debt refinancing cost in the current quarter and the Medfinders integration expenses in the prior year, our diluted earnings per share was $0.11 this quarter, which compares to $0.07 in the prior quarter and $0.03 in the prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $21 million and capital expenditures for the second quarter were $1.2 million. Day sales outstanding excluding the retained home healthcare account receivable were 53 days compared to 56 days in the last quarter and 54 days in the second quarter last year. As of June 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $15.5 million and our total debt outstanding net of discount was $194 million. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is calculated for our credit agreement was just over 3x. The company made $4 million in voluntary debt prepayments during the second quarter and has made an additional $20 million in voluntary debt prepayments thus far in the third quarter. This brings our under discounted debt balance as of today to $176 million. Based on this lower debt balance, we expect our leverage ratio to be under 2.75 times at the end of the third quarter. Now let's turn to our guidance for the third quarter. Consolidated revenue is expected to be between $236 million and $240 million, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 3% to 5%. This guidance is based on anticipated sequential growth of 1% to 2% in the Nurse and Allied segment with revenue essentially flat sequentially in our physician business segment. Gross margin are expected to be approximately 28% to 28.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to remain consistent with the prior quarter. This includes approximately $1 million in cost related to the strategic initiatives to grow our future candidate supply and enhance our workforce solutions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 7.5%. And with that we would like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you so much, Amy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Our leadership position and differentiation in the industry continues to provide benefits for AMN and our clients. In particular, our strength in providing MSP services and other workforce solutions is enabling our clients to better meet their patient care and financial goals. Our strong second quarter results were the outcome of the continued benefit of our workforce solutions leadership position, some mixed market conditions, and solid execution by our team. All of our business segments delivered year-over-year increases in revenue and gross margins. Second quarter consolidated revenue grew by 8% and adjusted EBITDA by 17%. Gross margin increased by 90 basis points to 29.3%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 8.4%, a 70 basis point improvement over prior year and a notable step towards our goal of 10%. We continued to make progress in expanding our position as the nation’s innovator in healthcare workforce solutions increasing AMN’s mix of revenue that is coming from MSP clients is a key part of our strategy as the higher fill rates enable us to grow faster during periods of market expansion and provide some protection during periods of demand softness. In other industries, MSP usage typically reaches 50% to 60% penetration at maturity. And we anticipate runway for us to continue to grow this competitive advantage. In the second quarter, we won several new MSP contracts. We also made significant progress in implementing the new Locums MSP contracts we mentioned last call. For the remainder of 2013, our MSP pipeline remains robust and we anticipate further penetration across all of our staffing businesses throughout the year. Now let’s review the results of our 3 business segments. I will start first with our largest segment of Nurse and Allied Staffing. Second quarter revenue for this segment was up 7% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. The largest contributor was the travel nurse business where volume was up 10% year-over- year and down 5% sequentially. Part of the decline was the slightly lower EMR revenue and the normal fall off of flu and winter seasonal demand. But this year we also had the affect of sequestration, lower hospital census and a generally more cautious client mindset due to budgetary concerns. We mentioned this on our last earnings call and the same environment persisted until just recently when demand for travel nurses began to increase again throughout July. Second quarter new nurse applications were up year-over-year which was partially aided by the early returns on the investments we have been making in candidate sourcing technologies. Going into the third quarter we expect to travel nurse revenue to be up in the mid-single digits year-over-year and flat sequentially. Normally, we would expect to be up slightly in the third quarter, but since the orders were down throughout most of Q2, it’s unlikely the sequential impact will be overcome by recent uptick in orders and the higher anticipated EMR business. We began to see a slight shift in the mindset of our clients which should continue to strengthen as their visibility into patient volume the second half of the year improves. Turning now to Local Staffing, second quarter revenue was up 1% compared to the prior year and down 4% sequentially. We continued to rationalize our geographic footprint and consolidated 5 lower performing branches into nearby locations. We now have a total of 42 local staffing branches to support markets with existing and potential MSP contracts. Going into the third quarter Local Staffing revenue is expected to be down slightly both year-over-year and sequentially. Now turning to Allied Staffing, second quarter Allied revenue was down 4% year-over-year and 3% sequentially driven primarily by the decline in therapy volume offset by a slight increase in the imaging and lab specialties. To address the current market challenges in therapy, we have realigned our resources and the team is concentrating on increasing our fill rates at MSP clients as well as targeting the less impacted acute care outpatient and home health client settings. Going into the third quarter Allied Staffing revenue is expected to be down in the low-teens year-over-year and in the low-single digit sequentially due primarily to the continued market declines in therapy With our increasing penetration into MSP clients, we believe that we can weather the storm better than other allied staffing companies and we will emerge in a stronger position as the market adjusts to reimbursement changes and eventually resumes growth. A bright sport has been the recent turnaround in AMN’s Locums Tenens segment where we see the changes that have been made over the past year beginning to pay off. Second quarter Locums revenue was up 8% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. This was the largest sequential growth that we have seen since 2007. The improvement was driven mainly by growth in our hospitals and primary care businesses as well as advanced practice specialties. We also began generating some incremental revenue from the new Locums MSPs that were being implemented in the first quarter. Gross margin increased by 110 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially due primarily to the improvements in bill pay spreads. Going into the third quarter we expect Locums revenue to be up in the mid to high-single digits year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. Our best performing segment this quarter was Physician Permanent Placement with second quarter revenue was up 16% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. The continued growth was driven by increases in new searches, placements and sourcing revenues. A team of fill achieved improvements in pricing and average recruiter productivity. The growth in searches has been broad based across specialties and settings with some of the strongest growth coming from family practice. Based on the new search activity in the second quarter we anticipate third quarter physician perm revenue to be up in the mid-teens year-over-year and up slightly sequentially. As many of you may know this high performing segment is led by Mark Smith. What you may not know is today is Mark Smith’s 25th anniversary with Merritt Hawkins. Congratulations Mark and we would like to thank you for your superb leadership. Our strategy of providing innovative workforce solutions and diversified staffing services to the healthcare community continues to differentiate AMN in the marketplace. We are engaging in strategic C- level dialogue beyond what we have seen previously in the industry. Healthcare providers continue to gain interest in adopting workforce solutions to address the influx of the additional 30 million insured citizens, the ageing and growing population and the emerging workforce shortages. Our clients also include other types of healthcare services organizations that are also seeking more efficient and effective ways to deliver on their growth expectations for the future. They are particularly motivated to take action and partner in new ways. Despite the softer than expected hospital admissions this year it is skill generally anticipated that volumes will expand in 2014 and beyond as the impact of Obamacare begins to take hold. To ensure we are best positioned to be the partner of choice for clients we have continued to invest in 3 key areas. This first is the expansion of our suite of workforce solutions and our differentiation as healthcare’s workforce innovator. The second is our leading edge recruitment technologies such as job distribution platforms and mobile applications to aggressively attract more candidate supply and to create a better candidate experience. And a third is the streamlining of our systems and infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. These investments will enable us to continue delivering revenue growth and improved operating leverage in the future. A final element and a key to our success are our passionate and dedicated team members who deliver excellent and differentiated value to our clients and our clinicians every day. It is their strong execution that sets AMN apart in the marketplace and enables us to company to deliver shareholder value. I will come back to you in our Q&A section along with Ralph and Bob to help answer your questions but for now. I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter revenue was $253.9 million, up 7.7% from last year and 0.7% from last quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.3%, up 90 basis points from last year and 30 basis points from last quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to margin improvements across all 3 of our reportable segments, sequentially the increase was driven by the gross margin improvement in Locum Tenens segment along with faster growth in our higher gross margin Physician Perm Placement segment. SG&A in the quarter totaled $54.6 million or 21.5% of revenue compared to 21.3% in the prior year and prior quarter. The year-over-year SG&A increase was due to a $1.7 million actuarial based increase in our professional liability reserve in our Locum Tenens segment as well as higher headcount commissions and other expenses related to the increased revenue and our strategic initiatives. Partially offsetting these increases was a $3 million credit to SG&A recorded in conjunction with the settlement of the Medfinders acquisition holdback. This holdback settlement was recorded through unallocated corporate overhead. The sequential SG&A increase was due to the same factors in addition to higher bad debt expense as the prior quarter included a credit from favorable collections on previously reserved accounts. Our second quarter Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased 7.3% from the prior year, but decreased sequentially by 3.7% to $170.1 million. Volume of 5,924 average clinicians on assignment grew 5.9% year-over- year and was lower by 4.7% sequentially. Revenue per day was up 1.3% year-over-year and down 0.1% sequentially with our year-over-year average bill rates higher by 1%. Nurse and Allied gross margin of 27.2% was higher year-over-year by 50 basis points with improved bill pay spreads and lower health insurance costs more than offsetting higher housing costs. Gross margin was lower by 30 basis points sequentially due to the prior quarter workers compensation reserve benefit of $1.2 million. Second quarter Nurse and Allied operating margin of 11.8% was higher by 20 basis points year-over-year and down 90 basis points from the prior quarter. The sequential decline was due in part to the prior quarter workers compensation reserve adjustment which added 70 basis points to the margin. Second quarter Locum Tenens segment revenue of $72.7 million was up 7.6% from the prior year and 11.1% sequentially. Gross margin of 29% was 110 basis points higher from the prior year due primarily to improved bill pay spreads and was also up sequentially by 110 basis points due to improved bill pay spreads and higher perm conversion fees. Second quarter Locum Tenens operating margin of 6.8% was lower by 220 basis points year-over-year and down 70 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year decline was due to the previously noted professional liability adjustment and higher employee related cost associated with the revenue growth. The sequential decline was due to the higher professional liability cost and higher bad debt expense due to the prior quarter bad debt recovery. Our second quarter Physician Permanent Placement segment revenue of $11.1 million was up year-over- year by 15.8% and sequentially by 12.1%. Gross margin improved by 280 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points from the prior quarter from improved recruiter productivity. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $21.3 million representing 8.4% of revenue. This compares to $18.2 million, or 7.7% of revenue in the prior year quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was $3.1 million, which compares to $13.6 million last year and $2.9 million last quarter. Interest expense in the quarter included $1 million of charges associated to the re- pricing of our credit agreement in early April. The amendment reduced our interest rate and provided for other favorable changes to our credit agreement. Our tax rate in the quarter was 38%, which included favorable adjustments related to the permanent tax difference on the Medfinders holdback settlement. We expect our tax rate for the second half and full year 2013 to be between 40% and 41%. We reported net income of $8.4 million in the second quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.18 for the second quarter. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $19.2 million and capital expenditures were $3.1 million. Days sales outstanding were 54 days compared to 56 days in the last quarter and 53 days last year. As of June 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $10.5 million and our total debt outstanding was $154 million. Our quarter end leverage ratio as calculated for our credit agreement was 2.1x as compared to 3.1x last year. Subsequent to quarter end, we made an additional voluntary debt payment of $5 million. Now let’s turn to our guidance for the third quarter. We expect consolidated revenue to be between $253 million and $257 million representing year-over-year revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Gross margin is expected to be 29% to 29.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be approximately 21.5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 8%. Third quarter interest expense will be $2 million and capital expenditures are projected to be $3 million. Diluted share count is expected to be 47.8 million for the third quarter and the full year. And with that, we would like to open up the call for questions."
60,GV_144520_2008Q3,"Presentation Operator The AMN Healthcare Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen- only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, with instructions being given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Vice President of Investor Relations Mr. Christopher Schwartz. Please go ahead sir. Christopher Schwartz Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the AMN Healthcare Services conference call to discuss the Company's earnings results for the third quarter 2008. For the call this afternoon, we have Susan Nowakowski, AMN's President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Dreyer, AMN's Chief Financial Officer. A replay of this webcast is available at amnhealthcare.com/investors and will be available until November 13, 2008. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements. As a result the various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st, 2007, and our current reports on Form 8-K, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the Company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to us. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The Company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan Nowakowski Thanks, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For those of you who know the AMN team, you know that we are quite disappointed to be reporting results, which fell below our expectations for the quarter. This is the first time in our history as a public Company that our earnings were below the low end of our expectation. However as we'll share today there were certainly positive results in the business and progress in building market share and launching new service offerings, particularly within our nurse staffing division. In addition to the normal operating results, there were also some non-recurring charges and tax adjustment that impacted the quarter. I am going to focus on the operating results and industry trends. And David will discuss the other adjustments later in the call. So now let's turn to the business. AMN's revenues for the third quarter was 315 million 5% higher than the same quarter last year, while adjusted EBITDA excluding those non-recurring charges from this quarter, decreased about 2% compared to last year. This quarter’s gross profit was up 2% over last year though gross margin fell about 90 basis points, due mainly to a change in our revenue mix. The drop in margin was mostly due to the lower contributions from our international travel nurse business and the physician permanent placement business. The team is doing a very good job of managing expenses amidst the slower revenue growth environment, while still staying committed to making investment in emerging market opportunity. This is best reflected by our relatively flat SG&A as the percent of revenue and gross profit excluding those non-recurring cost associated with the pharmacy business. In our largest segment of nurse and allied staffing, revenue grew 6% over the prior year and 1% sequentially. Year-over-year the addition of Platinum Select was the biggest contributor to this growth, while the volume declined in our international business continued to be the biggest drag on growth. Our travel nursing division, performed very close to expectations for Q3. With revenue up 2% over prior year and 2% over prior quarter, we believe this performance is well ahead of our competitors. During the quarter, placement volumes for future assignments in the travel nurse division were also up about 1% over prior year. NurseChoice which is our quick start, short-term staffing business, experienced strong double-digit revenue growth year-over-year and this exceeds growth rates reported by other companies in this particular niche. While our competitors in the larger traditional travel nurse segment have yet to report, we do believe that our results will reflect a noticeable gain in market share. This is a real testament to the strength of our multi-brand strategy and the talent and hard work of our nursing sales and service team. Looking forward however, the demand environment does appear more challenging as we’ve seen open orders for future assignments decline during September and October. The largest decline has been in the South-east particularly Florida, California has also softened a bit although not to the extent of Florida and other East Coast states. Our bright spots are the Mid-West and the North West where we are seeing some strong year-over-year increases in orders. In our travel allied business, rehab therapy showed strong double digit year-over- year growth in volume and revenue. However the continued softness in demand for imaging discipline has created some off setting decline to address this shift in the market, we have continued to move and reallocate resources from imaging to therapy and into other growing specialty such as lab technician. For both nursing and allied staffing, pricing continues to remain stable or growing depending upon the specialty. Our ability to recruit new supply quality Canada attract very closely to last year and we book rates of existing travelers are also attracting inline with the prior year. Gross margin and the nurse and allied staffing business narrowed by about 60 basis points compare to last quarter. However, the underline profitability of the core business remained relatively stable, if we exclude the fact of the international division. As you recall, we acquired our pharmacy Staffing business in 2007. Well, relatively small piece of our revenue, we do believe that this service line is an important strategic offering to our client. Unfortunately this group had been under performing relative to our expectation and so we made some critical leadership changes and Staff reductions during the third quarter to reposition the organization. We've already seen improvements in the business. Now, turning to our Locum Tenens Staffing business, although short of our expectation the division did achieve revenue growth of 3% compare to last year on 2% compare to last quarter, this growth was mainly driven by volume which rose 3% annually. Revenue per day filled was virtually flat year-over-year mostly due to the lower mix of some of the higher bill rate, specialty such as Radiology. Drilling down in to our different specialty groups. Behavioral health showed by far the strongest growth followed by primary care. Each produced double-digit revenue growth year-over-year and increase volumes and pricing. Dentistry they're still relatively smart continue to show a lot of promise for the future delivering double digit year-over-year volume and pricing growth. Radiology on the other hand continues to see a negative from lower reimbursement rates to imaging centers. In addition, there is anecdotal evidence suggesting a growing trend on the part of patients to delay elected procedure, which likely explains the slightly softer results we are seeing in surgery and anesthesia. Pricing continues to be relatively firm in Locum with the exception of Radiology. On a sequential basis overall revenue per day filled increased about 0.5% which was lead by primary care and surgery. We do believe that even in the mid the external factors that are effecting our Locum Tenens Staffing business. We could be performing better with improved processes and sales strategy. To this point on October 20th, Tim Boes joined us as the new President of our Locum Tenens business replacing Joe Caldwell, who recently decided to retire. Joe, build a strong team at Staff Care and lead the company from inception to the number one position within a Locum industry today. And although, we are set Chicago, we believe that Tim is the right leader to continue the evolution of Staff Care and to build on our performance in this expanding segment. Tim brings to AMN a proven track record and highly successful career in sales and marketing, most recently as National Vice President of Sales for Cardinal Health Pharmaceutical Distribution Services Division. Tim joins us at an important time and we look forward to its leadership impacting Staff Care and the overall AMN sales strategy. In our physician permanent placement segment, revenue in the third quarter fell by 5% compared to last year and 7% sequentially most of this short fall was due to an adjustment in the sales allowance, still even the otherwise relatively flat result were not what we expect from this business longer term. There are no public comps specific to physician permanent placement, however it does appear that other firms in the larger general retain search market are also experiencing reduced or slower revenue in volume trends. We continue to make infrastructure changes to improve our performance and build stronger relationships with our clients and our physicians. As I mentioned earlier in the year, we have several initiatives focused on further diversifying our product line and broadening our client base in order to expand our revenue growth opportunities. Some of these initiatives will generate minimal revenue for 2008, but most are expected to drive incremental revenue in 2009 and beyond. An example, of a current expansion is the launch of our surgery center staffing business which was introduced in June. Another is the launch of a recruitment process outsource offering which was announced earlier in October. AMN, RPO will manage the entire recruitment screening and selection from job requisition through new higher on boarding for facility clients, AMN experience in recruiting and credentialing 1000 of clinical professionals every year will allow us to improve our facilities time to hire and the quality of the candidate pool, resulting in reduced hiring cost. We plan to focus on nursing first and to work with partners to support the non-clinical hospital recruitment. Spending on this initiative contributed to a modest increase in SG&A this quarter. However, we believe these efforts are well timed to continue building the business to match the changing trends of health care. And at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to David, who will give you a bit more detail on the third quarter and the fourth quarter outlook, David? David Dreyer Well, thank you Susan and good afternoon. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was 315 million 5% higher than the third quarter of last year and 1% higher than last quarter. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due mainly to the acquisition of Platinum Select in February of this year and volume growth in the Locum Tenens staffing segment. The sequential increase in revenue was mainly due to growth in our short-term nurse business and locum tenens segment. Third quarter revenue came in 2% lower than our revenue guidance given on August 6, mostly from volumes slowing during the second half of the quarter. Consolidated gross margin in the third quarter was 25.7%, down 90 basis points from last year and 70 basis points from last quarter. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was driven mostly by lower gross profit contribution from our higher margin businesses, such as international nursing and the physician permanent placement and a shift in the mix of specialties within our local tenens staffing segment. We anticipate gross margin to remain fairly stable in the fourth quarter and end the year at approximately 26%. SG&A expenses in the third quarter were up 8% over last year and remain relatively unchanged from last quarter. The increase in SG&A compared to last year was mainly attributable to the acquisition of Platinum Select in February along with the charges for both restructuring and legal expenses associated with our pharmacy staffing division. These charges also contributed to the increase in SG&A compared to last year. Excluding the restructuring legal and other non-recurring expenses associated with the pharmacy business, SG&A as a percentage of revenues would have been 18.6% flat compared to the same quarter last year and down compared to last quarter. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the third quarter was 3.8 million, up 26% over last year and up slightly from last quarter. This expense is comprised of 2.6 million in depreciation and 1.2 million in amortization, compared to the same quarter last year, depreciation increased by 600,000 due mainly to internally developed software projects, the placement service in late 2007. Amortization increased 200,000 compared to last year due mainly to the acquisition of Platinum Select. Depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter are expected to remain stable with the third quarter as a percentage of revenue. Net interest expense in the third quarter was 2.5 million, down 17% compared to the same quarter last year and down 4% compared to last quarter. The year-over-year decrease reflects the pay down of 36 million of our term loan and lower LIBOR rates over the past year. The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 34% below the 40 to 41% rate that we have guided throughout the year. This was the result of our identifying an income tax matter that impacts to traveler healthcare staffing industry. Since nearly the inception of the industry over two decades ago, it has been common industry practice for companies to offer logging per diem payments. However, we recently became aware that a portion of these per diem payments may not be fully deductible for income tax purposes. We have determined that the impact of this matter for AMN was immaterial to previously issued financial statements. This quarter’s financial statements along with future financial statements will reflect adjustments for this tax changes. The company has recorded in its current consolidated financial statements, income tax benefits cause in the effective rates to be 34% and 33% for the third quarters of both 2008 and 2007 respectively. These changes will also cause some variation in our future quarterly tax rates including the fourth quarter of 2008, when we estimate our projected quarterly effective tax rate could increase to as much as 49%. However, for the full year 2008, our effective tax rate is expected to only increase to approximately 43 or 44%. Earnings per share up $0.28 was 12% higher than last quarter with 17% lower than last year, after reflecting tax adjustments in the second quarter of 800,000 and the benefit in the third quarter of 2007 up $2 million. Earnings per share at this quarter included a 3 penny charge for restructuring and legal expenses in our pharmacy staffing division and $0.01 charge for establishing a sales allowance in our permanent placement business offset by the $0.04 impact from the logging per diem tax benefit. As Susan mentioned, this quarter’s earnings per share was also 3% below the low end of guidance. Fully diluted share is outstanding during the third quarter with 33.9 million down 3% from last year and 1% from last quarter. We repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter and our cost of approximately 22 million. After taking into account to repurchases completed so far, we have 9.6 million available for repurchases under the plan through the first quarter of 2009. The company generated 21 million of operating cash flow during the third quarter, which one combined with 6 million of net cash on hand and a 112 million of revolver draw downs, we used primarily the fund share repurchases, pay estimated tax and service our debt. We ended of the quarter with $158 million of debt. Our leverage ratio is 1.7 times trailing adjusted EBITDA as compared to 1.6 times a year ago. DSO at the end of the quarter was 56 days, down 4 days from last year and down 2 days from last quarter, reflecting continued improvement in our collection efforts. Now, turning to our business segments, revenue in the Nurse and Allied segment this quarter was $217 million, up 6% over the prior year and 1% sequentially, travelers on assignment averaged 7,185 this quarter, up 4% year-over-year and stable with last quarter. Gross profit for traveler per day in the third quarter decreased 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially driven by a reduction in our international traveler account and the narrowing bill pay spreads. The adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment was 6.3%, down 140 basis points from last year and 150 basis points from last quarter, due to lower gross margin and higher SG&A related to the restructuring of legal expenses associated with the pharmacy staffing division. Revenue in the Locum Tenens segment increased to $85 million this quarter, up 3% from last year and 2% from last quarter. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher volumes in our primary care and behavioral health divisions. Days filled volume overall for the Locum Tenens business increased 3% year- over-year and 1% sequentially. Gross margin was 26.6% down 40 basis points from last year and up 80 basis points from last quarter. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.8%, down on a 130 basis points from last year and up 270 basis points from last quarter to mainly to last quarter's higher insurance cost and bad debt expense along with our higher gross margin this quarter. Revenues for the position permanent placement business were $12.6 million, down 5% from last year and 7% from last quarter. Included in this quarter revenue, was the addition of sales reserve adjustment of $500,000. Excluding this adjustment, revenue would have been stable with last year and down 3% from last quarter. Gross margin was 57.5%, down 270 basis points year-over-year and down 220 basis points from last quarter. Although placements and new searches were down over prior year, they were up sequentially over last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin for this business was 22%, down 80 basis points from last year and 660 basis points from last quarter. Now, I'll provide you with our revenue and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. In light of the uncertain economic conditions and the potential impact on our industry, we are reducing our previous expectations for the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to range from $295 million to $300 million, and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.20 to $0.23, which reflects a tax expense adjustment of $0.02 for lodging per diems. For the full year we expect revenue to approximate $1.22 billion and earnings per share to range from $0.99 to $1.02 which reflects a full year impact of $0.03 tax expense for lodging per diems. If we exclude this quarter's, $0.03 charge for restructuring and legal expenses in our pharmacy division and the $0.01 charge for adjusting the sales allowance in our permanent placement business and the full $0.03 full year tax expense impact of the lodging per diems, the pro forma full year earnings per share is expected to range from $1.06 to $1.09. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Susan. Susan Nowakowski Thank you, David. Despite the challenges we've discussed, we are making very good progress and continuing to strengthen the business for the future. During these times we have rededicated ourselves to focus on three key aspects of our strategy. First, continuing to capture more market share; second, to innovate and drive efficiency and productivity gains which should further reduce our cost structure in the future; and third, continuing to expand and diversify our business by pursuing emerging market opportunities and responding to the changes within healthcare delivery. We are working to ensure we remain nimble in the short term, but at the same time we are continuing to make appropriate investments to be well positioned in the long term. And with that, we would like to open up the call to your questions."
61,GV_144520_2009Q3,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the AMN Healthcare Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Amy Chang. Please go ahead. Amy Chang Thank you, Beth. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to AMN Healthcare's third quarter 2009 earnings call. A replay of this webcast will be available at amnhealthcare.com/investors and will be available until November 12, 2009. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and other quarterly and periodic reports which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend however to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Think you, Amy. While there are early indicators of improvement in some of our markets, the prolonged negative economic environment and in particular, the high levels of general unemployment persists in creating constraints on our business. The team at AMN Healthcare remains steadfast in our execution of the nuts and bolts of serving our customers well, while also investing the time and resources necessary to position the company to be a stronger, value-added partner for our clients. As a recognized leader and innovator in the industry, there continues to be opportunities even in today's challenging environment to strengthen our leadership position. There are four key areas in which we are diligently focused. First, we continue to build stronger client relationships and are aggressively pursuing and delivering on preferred provider and managed services contracts. Second, we're making progress in our new market expansion initiatives to further diversify our service lines. Third, we are streamlining our business model, including our operational and cost structure to improve our margins and profitability as the market resumes growth. And fourth, we have strengthened our balance sheet by paying down our debt and maintaining strong operating cash flow, enabling us to take advantage of future market expansion opportunities. Our ability to remain agile and execute well in the short-term, while keeping an eye on nurturing our new service lines will allow us to emerge from this economic cycle as a stronger leader, to be better a partner for our clients and well positioned to capitalize on new market opportunities. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2009 was $166 million, a decrease of 47% from prior year and 16% from prior quarter. The primary driver of the year-over-year and sequential decline was the decrease in Nurse and Allied staffing revenue which was down 62% from the same quarter last year and down 26% sequentially. While this was in line with our earlier predictions, that volumes in this segment would further decline in July and August and bottom out in September and October, this stability seems to now be sustainable. As we look to November, we are seeing consistent, and in some weeks, slightly increased traveler accounts. Our Nursing and Allied orders grew through the third quarter and gained particular momentum in September and October. While still below last year, today's nursing orders are the highest that they've been in 2009 and appear to be ticking up week-by-week. This is consistent with some of the healthcare facilities reporting stable admission levels and anticipating higher admissions in the near term. It is difficult to predict the trajectory of future order growth but even at the current order levels which are above our traveler accounts, we believe there is opportunity for growth as we go into 2010. The uncertain economic environment and high general unemployment rates have made it easier for facilities to recruit and retain permanent healthcare professionals, as well as draw in retirees and part-time clinicians. However, most agree these conditions are not sustainable. As the overall economy improves and probably more importantly, their perception of the future economic environment improves, we anticipate healthcare professionals will return to part-time work in retirement, resulting in increased demand for temporary assignments and supply. Despite the near-term challenges, the long-term fundamentals that drive our industry have not materially changed. The basic model of patient care delivery through nurses, allied professionals and physicians will continue and we will need more clinicians in the future, not fewer, to serve the growing aging population. Patient flow from greater access to healthcare is also expected to increase as reform initiatives are implemented. While there is still much uncertainty around what exactly will be passed in healthcare reform, the outcome is still anticipated to increase the demand on clinicians and should be positive for the healthcare staffing industry. Based on these macroeconomic dynamics, it is not a matter of if there will be increased demand for clinicians, but more a matter of the timing and severity of the shortages that are looming ahead. This is evident as hospitals continue to stay focused on physician recruitment and long-term expansion of their clinical services. While the long-term fundamentals are still very compelling, the short-term lower demand for temporary clinical staff has heightened the importance of delivering a superior client experience. We want our clients satisfied and recognizing the differentiated value we bring everyday. Throughout this year, we have been successful in strengthening and building relationships with clients, and aggressively pursuing preferred provider and managed services agreements. We have found that if facilities rationalize the number of providers they work with, we're benefiting from our strong historical relationships, our relentless focus on quality, our innovative reputation and the financial stability we have as the industry leader. To this point, we are very pleased to have been recently selected as of the exclusive managed services provider to staff travel and per diem nurses for the California Kaiser Foundation hospitals. Kaiser was seeking a strong partner who could consistently provide a high level of service and quality clinicians, across their numerous acute care facilities. We are very proud to be partnering with Kaiser and look forward to finalizing contract details and beginning this new relationship effective January 1. We believe this to be one of the largest managed services nurse staffing contracts in the country. These preferred client relationship position AMN well to capture more market share as demand continues to recover. Another example of execution today that will position us for future growth is our Recruitment Process Outsourcing service line which was launched less than a year ago. Although still a small division, this service line continues to grow steadily and differentiates AMN in the marketplace as an innovative, solutions-oriented partner for our clients. As the economy rebounds and attrition rates begin to rise, hospitals will ramp up their permanent recruitment again. RPO will enable us to help our clients by providing a solution that extends beyond our traditional travel staffing services. Our Locum Tenens segment achieved third quarter revenues of $75 million, which is 12% lower compared with prior year and 5% lower than last quarter. This sequential decline was driven primarily by a double-digit decrease in anesthesia volume and to a lesser extent, in surgery, radiology and primary care. These were offset by an increase in behavioral health. The decline in the anesthesia market began in the third quarter and appears to be widespread throughout the industry, affecting anesthesiology groups and contract management firms as well as locum tenens providers. One driver being cited is the lower levels of surgical volumes, particularly in elective surgery. Because of the lack of hospital and ambulatory surgery expansion in 2009, the contract management firms and the anesthesiology groups have also seen a halt in the number of new or expansion contracts. These new business implementations have been a historically strong source of demand for locum tenens for this specialty. In addition, clients seemed to have experienced more success hiring anesthesia professionals into permanent positions. Even within our own supply of anesthesiology locums, it appears the economic environment lower demand has created a desire to seek more employment certainty and during the middle of the year, we saw a larger number accepting permanent positions. Our Anesthesia business currently comprises approximately 15% of our locum tenens volume. For now, it appears the step down in anesthesia demand has stabilized, albeit at levels for the fourth quarter at about 40% below prior year. Over the past few weeks, we have seen a pick up in our demand however, it is still difficult to assess how long it will take for volumes to recover to the prior levels. The biggest drivers for resumed growth in this area will likely be tied to surgery volumes and improvement in general economic conditions. In conjunction with the end of the Federal government's fiscal year, a new locum tenens contracting program became effective on October 1. These program changes resulted in a temporary disruption to our government business. While this had only a small effect on our government business in the third quarter, this will have a greater impact on the fourth quarter. We do expect to recover much of this business over the next several months. Overall, in our Locum Tenens segment, revenue per days sold was down slightly by 2% both year-over- year and sequentially, which was due primarily to the continued mix shift away from our highest bill rate group of radiology. Days filled volume for the quarter was down 10% over prior year and 3% sequentially. Our overall days available which is an indicator of current demand has recently dropped to a lower level compared with prior year. This is consistent with other industry reports published in the past month. Despite the lower demand levels, our recruitment and placement teams are doing an excellent job of recruiting candidates and increasing fill rates, which are higher than last year across all specialties. In addition, through efficiency improvements and careful expense management, the team was able to grow operating income year-over-year. In addition to focusing on daily execution, we continue to dedicate resources to new areas that will fuel our future growth in the locum tenens market. For example, in the third quarter, we experienced solid growth in dentistry, which is one of our newer specialties. Last quarter, we re-entered the private sector emergency medicine staffing market and have continued to make steady progress. We have had success growing our new days available and are working to build our available supply to fill this demand. In Physician Permanent Placement, third quarter revenues were $8.7 million, which is 31% below prior year and 2% below prior quarter. While there aren't any notable direct comparisons, these results appeared to be in line with other executive retained search companies. The year-over-year shortfall is primarily due to lower overall searches, placements and pricing. Although hospitals continue to focus on physician recruitment as a strategic part of their growth initiatives, in 2009, they have been relying more on their internal hiring of physicians in order to lower their costs. Here, like in nursing, we have seen improvement in our leading indicators. In the third quarter, we experienced a sequential spike in the new retained searches. We expect this increase in new searches to be sustainable and to translate into increased placements over the coming months. Throughout the year, we have been very proactive and disciplined in adjusting our infrastructure across all business lines, both in direct response to the short-term market trends, as well as to make permanent and strategic improvements to our business model. In the third quarter, we completed the implementation of the facility consolidation and brand rationalization discussed in our previous earnings call. These moves will further streamline our business model and improve our profitability to better leverage our infrastructure in the future. While our third quarter travel nurse count was impacted by the strategic branding decisions, these changes will benefit us as we move forward and we are better able to leverage the strengths of our continuing brand. Through the year, we have maintained our focus on execution by staying close to our customers and aggressively pursuing preferred relationships. In addition, we have made solid moves to streamline our operating model and improve our cost structure, which has enabled us to continue growing our new service offerings while still maintaining respectable operating margins. These efforts position us to continue our track record of balancing disciplined execution in the short-term, while building on our long-term strategy of investing in client-focused innovation and new market opportunities. These organizational transitions have taken a tremendous amount of resolve and hard work on the part of our very passionate and talented team members. These changes simply would not have been possible without their commitment and sacrifice. I'd like to thank each and every AMN team member for their continued commitment in serving our clients and pursuing our mission. At this point, I would now like to turn the call over to Barry Bailey, our CFO, who will give you more detail on our third quarter results and our financial position. Barry? Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Susan and good afternoon, everyone. Susan has provided you an overview of the top line performance for the quarter overall and by segment. In the second quarter earnings call, we indicated we expected revenues to decline approximately 15% in the third quarter with actual results coming in at 16.5%. While our Nurse and Allied business appears to have stabilized more recently, based on travelers on assignment and outstanding order volume, we did see further erosion, as Susan noted, in our Anesthesia business within our Locum segment. Rather than move to capture share at any cost in a difficult market, we have focused on the quality of our earnings at both the gross profit and EBITDA levels by maintaining the highest levels of service and quality. Our consolidated gross margin in the third quarter of 2009 was 27.4% versus 25.7% in the prior year and 27% last quarter. The increase from last year and last quarter is primarily due to our higher-margin Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement segments, representing a greater portion of our business mix. As we look forward to next quarter, we expect our overall gross margin to be consistent with what we saw in the third quarter. SG&A expenses came in at $37 million, which was 39% lower than prior year and 2% lower than prior quarter. This lower level of SG&A is largely due to lower employee and office-related expenses, resulting from cost-reduction actions taken this year. Included in SG&A this quarter was a benefit of $1.5 million, as a result of the of the settlement of the cash hold back liability with the selling shareholders of the MHA Group. This benefit was partially offset by an $800,000 increase in bad debt reserves associated with the large VMS [Vendor Management Services] technology provider that is facing liquidity problems. We are taking steps to mitigate our exposure to similar such occurrences. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect our SG&A spending levels to decline slightly as we experience the full benefit of our cost-reduction efforts, although increasing as a percentage of revenue due to the projected decline in fourth quarter revenue. As I'm sure you have already noted, our earnings release tables, we have changed our segment reporting Reflecting the emphasis on managing costs more correlated with our business segments and segregating our corporate costs, we are no longer allocating corporate costs that cannot be specifically identified with directly supporting one of our three segments. The result is that for the third quarter, we are reporting unallocated corporate overhead totaling $3.8 million as compared to $8.2 million for the same period in the prior year, a decline of 54%. I do want to note here that the $1.5 million credit I referenced earlier is netted in the $3.8 million. Reflecting the new approach to allocating corporate costs, our Nurse and Allied segment operating income for the third quarter was $4.6 million, representing a 78% decline as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in operating income in our Nurse and Allied segment is greater than the declines we saw in its corresponding revenue due to the fixed nature of certain infrastructure costs associated with this segment. These costs are expected to grow at a slower pace than revenue as the business rebounds, which will provide positive operating leverage in the future. As a result, operating income margins declined to 5.6% from 9.4% in the third quarter of 2008. And Nurse and Allied gross margin this quarter was 24.4%, 80 basis points higher than the same period in 2008 and 60 basis points lower than last quarter. Traveler volume declined 26% as compared to the second quarter of this year to 2,704. Operating income for our Locum Tenens segment was $7.5 million, an increase over the same period in the previous year of 1% despite revenues declining 12%. The operating margin of 10% was benefited by an increase in gross margin to 27.2% for the quarter, which is up 60 basis points compared to last year and 110 basis points compared to the previous quarter. The improvement in operating income in our Locums business was driven by continued improvements in our cost structure and by specialty mix, somewhat offset by lower days filled. Our Physician Permanent Placement services operating income of $2.2 million declined 36% as compared to the same quarter last year, consistent with the decline in revenues for the same period. Gross margin in the third quarter was 57.7%, slightly up as compared to the same period in 2008. Separate from our segments, we recorded $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, consisting primarily of lease-related charges, associated with facility consolidation and severance payments. Year-to-date, we have incurred $11 million in restructuring charges. We are not expecting to incur further restructuring charges during the fourth quarter. The company's effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.3% compared to 34.4% last year and 44.8% last quarter. The sequential decrease reflected in part a catch-up tax adjustment last quarter to true-up to the full-year projected rate. Overall, the company's tax rate reflects the impact of permanent differences that are not deductible for tax purposes and given the company's loss position in the current year, results in a lower than expected overall tax rate. The effective rate is significantly influenced by the level of pretax income and the corresponding amount of our permanent differences. The company recorded a net loss of $2 million or $0.06 per share. Excluding restructuring charges, the company's net income on an adjusted basis was $2 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow which was assisted by significant reductions in accounts receivable. During the third quarter, we generated $19 million of operating cash flow, which was used primarily to pay down debt. Days sales outstanding increased by one day to 53 days but was down by three days compared to a year ago. We ended the quarter with $77 million of debt outstanding, a reduction of $69 million since the beginning of the year, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.1x, an improvement compared to of 1.7x a year ago. We're in compliance with our debt covenants and have already begun looking at refinancing our current credit agreement as we look at opportunities in the marketplace. In addition, we have been able to grow our cash and equivalents by $15 million since year end to $23 million. I will now return the call back to Susan. Susan? Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thanks, Barry. Now for a brief outlet on our business trends in the fourth quarter. Nursing orders are continuing to grow and the year-over-year gap is narrowing. As we enter the fourth quarter, Nurse and Allied traveler accounts has clearly stabilized and is showing signs of improvement. We feel very well positioned as we enter 2010. In Locum Tenens, we experienced lower sequential demand in the third quarter, primarily due to the anesthesia market weakness. As we enter the fourth quarter, the anesthesia demand appears to have stabilized. However, as I mentioned earlier, we are expecting lower volumes in our government business. In the Physician Permanent Placement, the increased new searches experienced during the third quarter are expected to result in improved placements over the coming months. Overall, pricing and gross margins are expected to remain consistent. Based on these trends and the effect of the normal holiday seasonal volume decline, fourth quarter consolidated revenue is expected to decrease sequentially by 10% to 15%, about a third to half of this decline is what we would consider normal seasonal trends. As I hope we have been able to convey on this call, we remain very focused on four key aspects of our strategy: Building stronger relationships with our clients, growing our new service offerings, improving our cost structure and operating model, and prudent management of our balance sheet. These key initiatives have enabled us to deliver respectable margins despite the prolonged challenging environment in the short-term, while at the same time positioning us for long-term growth and expansion of our leading position. And with that, we would now like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski AMN's Healthcare President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thanks so much, Amy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AMN Healthcare's 2010 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As we shared in our press release earlier today, AMN reported our strongest quarter of the year and again led our industry with a second quarter of sequential growth. We have a lot of good news and insights to share and we'll provide you with more details on the drivers of that growth. In addition to our organic performance, we also closed on the acquisition of Medfinders on September 1. And so we thought you might first like to hear more about our early progress in the integration efforts. After my comments, Bary Bailey, AMN's CFO, will share additional financial details and provide an outlook for the fourth quarter. Also joining us in the room for Q&A are Bob Livonius, AMN's President of Workforce Solutions; and Ralph Henderson, AMN's President of Nurse and Allied Staffing. We know there is a lot of attention on the benefits and synergies being created by the AMN Medfinders combination, so I thought it would be helpful to have them here to provide you with as much detail as possible. I think you will be very pleased as you learn more about our progress. I'm often asked whether there has been anything about the Medfinders acquisition that has been different than what we expected. One thing that has exceeded our expectations and quite frankly, has been a very pleasant surprise is how quickly and strongly the benefits of this combination have resonated with our clients and with our team members. From the client's perspective, the combination instantly improved our ability to offer a broader and deeper array of workforce solutions and it has noticeably increased our ability to deliver the largest supply of local and national clinicians. Healthcare facilities are continuing to express growing interest in exclusive Managed Services relationship where they can improve on their internal efficiencies by using one company to manage all of their supplemental clinical staffing needs. And AMN is now positioned as the number one provider in this space. From a team member perspective, I have been very impressed with how quickly and collaboratively our teams have come together. Combining forces has already shown immediate benefits and enabled AMN to grow into the market recovery in an even stronger position. Together, the company has over 110 Managed Services contracts to be the exclusive provider of supplemental nurse staffing to over 350 healthcare facilities nationwide. As staffing needs grow at each of these facilities, AMN will have the opportunity to build a higher percentage of their growing demand. We continue to focus on our Managed Services programs through adding new client contracts, as well as converting current clients to these exclusive contracts. The Nurse Staffing businesses of AMN and Medfinders were complementary and not just duplicative. Prior to the acquisition, AMN was the strong leader in travel nurse staffing with no local per diem presence. On the other hand, Medfinders had a very solid per diem presence in several markets, but a relatively small footprint in travel nursing. This made it challenging for them to fill the travel nurse needs at many of their MSP clients. With these complimentary strengths, the company can now increase its collective direct fill rates across MSP clients. In fact, we're already doing this. For example, in just the two months since the companies have been combined, we have doubled and in some places, nearly tripled our travel nurse direct fill rates and placements at key MSP accounts. This is a direct and immediate benefit for our clients from our stronger capabilities. As we've communicated with you before, our target is to achieve at least $2 million in incremental annualized EBITDA from these increased direct fill synergies by the fourth quarter of next year. The seeds for other incremental revenue synergies are already being planted with our addition of per diem staffing services to several of our travel nurse contracts. On other integration fronts, we continue to make very good progress towards achieving the $8 million in annualized cost synergies by the fourth quarter of next year. The bulk of these savings will come from the consolidation of corporate back office functions. This effort is already underway and will be going into phases through the remainder of this year and next. Another significant piece of the cross synergies will come from the consolidation of the travel nurse and allied operations and implementation of a shared service model. The travel nurse consolidation was largely completed this week and the travel allied consolidation is anticipated to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2011. AMN has a proven track record of integrating acquisitions and we are confident that we can be successful in achieving the anticipated synergies. At this time, I would like to give an overview of our business highlights and market trends. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, third quarter consolidated revenues were up sequentially by 4%, which in comparison to our public reporting competitors would indicate we are continuing to expand our market share. This represented the second sequential quarterly growth in consolidated revenues and the third sequential quarterly growth in our largest business of Nurse and Allied Staffing. In the third quarter, the Nurse and Allied business generated $93 million in revenues, which included 5% organic growth compared with the prior quarter. Organic sequential volume growth was the main driver with pricing remaining relatively stable. Our Travel Nurse business produced the greatest growth with 6% sequential increases in volume and revenue. This growth is being fueled by the increasing benefit of our Managed Services offerings and our strong client relationships. Orders during the third quarter continue to be above prior year levels and what's encouraging is that we have seen similar growth in orders at our MSP clients and our traditional travel nurse clients non- MSPs across the country. This is usually a sign of an increasingly healthier market environment. The total number of client facilities with orders also continues to show sequential increases reflecting another positive demand indicator. The allied disciplines we provide also contributed to our growth with about a 5% sequential organic increase in volumes in the third quarter. The biggest driver of this increase continues to be in the rehab therapy specialties which have the greatest demand-supply imbalance. Including the one month impact of the acquisition, third quarter Nurse and Allied revenues were up 23% sequentially. This includes the Medfinders addition of $7 million in revenues associated with the local per diem business and $7 million for travel nurse and allied for the month of September. Our Locum Tenens segment delivered third quarter revenues of $70 million, which included 3% organic growth over the last quarter plus $2 million from one month of the Medfinders Locums business. While our organic growth rate continues to be at the top of the industry, it did fall a little short of our expectations, which is the main reason we came in at the lower end of our revenue guidance for the quarter. Days filled volumes increased organically by 4% in the quarter, with modest increases across all specialties and the strongest gain being in primary care. Days sold, which is our best indicator of future placement opportunities were sequentially flat during the quarter with some weakness in Dentistry, Radiology and Surgery, and offset by improvement in Primary Care. While we have experienced modest growth in our Locums business since the beginning of the year, most of our competitors have lagged which is a sign that the overall market has not yet resumed to a normal state. Our growth should be a good sign that the overall market growth is soon to come and there is strong agreement in the industry and among analyst that the long-term demand and supply dynamics of the Physician Staffing business are still quite strong. In Physician Permanent Placement, third quarter revenues were $8.7 million which included a 3% increase over the prior quarter on an organic basis. Placement volumes have increased slightly, but the demand for new searches seems to be showing some signs of weakness. This is a reflection of the continuing uncertain economic environment and our internal challenges in rebuilding our sales teams after the severe hit to the industry over the last 18 months. One of the strategic benefits that came with our acquisition of Medfinders was our entry into the delivery of Home Healthcare services. This move advances our long-term strategy of extending into businesses that address significant pain points for our current clients. Acute-care facilities are focusing more on the transition of patients to a quality recovery setting to avoid readmit. At the same time, healthcare providers are coming together to coordinate patient care to improve outcomes and efficiencies. In both cases, Home Healthcare providers can play a significant role in the patient care delivery chain. In the third quarter, the company added approximately $5 million in revenues from home Healthcare Services for the month of September. On a pro forma basis, the Home Health business declined approximately 2% sequentially in the third quarter. This was primarily a result of the closure of an office in Pueblo, Colorado and the consolidation of that business into our Colorado Springs office. While our markets are still relatively constrained, we are pleased with our team's ability to build our market share and deliver industry leading growth. The combination of a relatively stronger organic growth and the benefits of the Medfinders acquisition should set us up well to continue our evolution and grow at a faster rate as our industry conditions become stronger. AMN is now solidly the leading provider of exclusive managed services contracts, which gives us an important platform and credibility to deliver innovative workforce solutions that integrate into our clients’ processes and help them to improve their efficiencies. Before I turn the call over to Bary, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our key members for their tremendous efforts and talents. The industry leading performance that we're reporting today is a direct result of their passion and commitment to our clients and healthcare professionals. It has been very inspiring to watch the AMN and Medfinders team come together so quickly and so effectively. We are already seeing the results of their proactive and collaborative efforts and we want to thank them so much. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bary Bailey. Bary? Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Susan. And good afternoon, everyone. Since we have already communicated quite extensively on the acquisition of Medfinders and the related issuance of equity and the amendment and extension of our credit facility, I will leave any discussion regarding this to the Q&A and refer you to materials provided to the SEC and on our website. So now then let's turn to our third quarter performance. Susan just provided us with an overview of the top line performance for the third quarter. Overall, gross margin of 27.4% in the quarter continued to hold up well, consistent with the third quarter of 2009, although slightly down compared to last quarter. Gross margin was negatively impacted by the pay bill spread in our Locum Tenens business, partially offset by the higher-margin Medfinders business reflected in our results for one month, which added 50 basis points. Excluding costs associated with the transaction and integration of the two companies, which totaled $6.3 million in the third quarter, and $1.1 million in the second quarter, SG&A increased $6 million, sequentially. Excluding Medfinders' SG&A cost, SG&A increased only $1.3 million or 4%. This increase in SG&A is directly tied to increases in employee costs associated with increased commissions on a higher revenue, some increases in staffing and an extra payroll day. In the first month of the acquisition, while integration efforts are well underway and on track, we did not expect and have not reflected any significant synergies. The benefits will be realized over the next several quarters with the majority being realized on a run rate basis by the middle of next year. Our Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 23%, excluding the impact of the acquisition, which was included for one month, the Nurse and Allied business grew 5%. Traveler accounts increased essentially the same percentage. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, the Nurse and Allied gross margin decreased 20 basis points due to higher payroll cost including housing. The Medfinders Nurse and Allied business for the month of September added $14 million in revenue for the quarter and generated gross margin at 28%. The higher gross margin for the Medfinders business reflects subcontractor fees, which we expect will decrease over time as we saw more of the demand under the contracts with our own local and travel staff. The third quarter Nurse and Allied segment operating income as reported was $8.6 million as compared to $7.3 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Our Locum Tenens segment experienced sequential revenue growth of 6%. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, revenue increased 3%, reflecting the impact of a 4% increase in days filled for the AMN business, offset by a shift in demand in the quarter to lower-priced specialties. The impact of the shift in specialties during the quarter impacted our gross margin and ultimately, gross profit. Whereby, excluding the impact of the acquisition, gross margin declined 110 basis points and gross profit declined 1.3%. The Medfinders' Locums business reflects a higher margin on comparatively lower dollars, due in part to the mix of specialties. Locum's operating income of $5.4 million reflects a 16% decline from the previous quarter. About 50% of the decline in operating income on a sequential basis was due to lower bad debt expense in the second quarter of this year than we are seeing in this quarter and what we would expect on a normal run rate basis. The balance of the decrease is a result of increased activity, but at the lower bill- pay spread. Within our Physician Permanent Placement segment, revenue grew sequentially by 4% with the Medfinders revenue for the month of September contributing about a 100 basis points. Physician Permanent Placement operating income for the third quarter was $1.7 million. Through the acquisition, the company added a new reporting segment, Home Healthcare services, which generated revenue of $5 million for the month of September and $500,000 in operating income for the same period. Gross margin on this business was 37.4% for the period reported, consistent with its historical margin levels. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock-based compensation in the third quarter was $12.6 million, up from $7 million in the preceding quarter and up from $3.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The sequential increase is due to the $6.3 million in costs incurred associated with the acquisition for legal, accounting, operational due diligence and integration cost I previously mentioned. The prior quarter included about $1.1 million in such cost and as a result, unallocated overhead was essentially flat. The balance of the increase as compared to the prior year was largely due to a credit in the prior year associated with the resolution of the hold back from the previous MHA acquisition. Interest expense in the quarter includes financing fees incurred to accomplish the additional borrowings or charged off in the quarter directly to interest expense and this added $5.2 million. One obvious item that stands out is the impairment of goodwill and certain other intangible assets for AMN. This is unrelated to the acquisition of Medfinders. Every company is required to assess the realizability of such assets on at least an annual basis, which we typically do in the fourth quarter. However, with our stock price at the level it has been for the last several months, we determined that it was appropriate to assess the value in this quarter, taking into account the value of the stock of the company immediately prior to the acquisition. The effort to assess the value is relatively extensive and we will continue to assess these values, but given the share price and the implied discount rates suggested by that share price, we have estimated that there is a technical impairment of goodwill and certain other identified intangibles totaling approximately $49.8 million. And as a result, have recorded this charge in the third quarter. After giving effect to this charge prior to the additional of goodwill from the Medfinders acquisition, AMN had approximately $40 million in goodwill remaining. Taking into account the write off of goodwill, as well as transaction-related charges, integration cost and the cost of the financing, we reported a pretax loss of $60.8 million. As a result of this pretax loss, we have recorded a tax benefit. The benefit recorded reflects the impact of certain permanent differences such as the goodwill impairment and a portion of the acquisition related cost. Excluding the impairment charge, the cost associated with the acquisition and integration as well as the financing fees expensed in the period, we expect our tax rate on a full year basis to be approximately 66%. This rate is different from the statutory rate in large part due to permanent differences having a disproportionate impact as a result of our near-term lower pretax income. We expect next year's rate to be in the mid-50s range. For the quarter, we reported a loss per share of $1.48, reflecting the impact of the impairment charge which contributed a $1.25 to the loss per share, the transaction and integration charges that contributed about $0.13 and the cost of the financing that contributed $0.09. In addition, while we did not record an accrual for the dividend on the preferred shares issued in the quarter, we included the impact of what that accrual would have been for the purposes of calculating the loss per share. The impact of the implied preferred dividend for one month added $0.01 to the loss per share. Taking all this into account, we had a break even EPS. For the third quarter, operating cash flow reflects a use of cash of $15 million due primarily to the acquisition and financing cost related to the acquisition that were not capitalized as part of the transaction, which combined totaled $11.5 million. In addition, we made a concerted effort during the quarter to refund our [ph] credit balances in AR [ph] which resulted in a use of approximately $2 million in cash. Day sales outstanding, looking at revenue on a pro forma basis were 54 days as compared to 55 last quarter. We continue to closely manage capital expenditures without limiting important investments and as a result, capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $1.1 million. We will continue to manage capital expenditures but do expect them increase somewhat due to the integration of Medfinders and as we look for opportunities to improve performance through the use of technology. As of September 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $2 million and our long-term debt outstanding was $217 million with no borrowings under our $40 million revolver. Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see overall steady modest sequential growth in our business. Offset by some seasonal pressure. The Nursing and Allied business continues to experience momentum with revenues expected to be up sequentially approximately 5% on a pro forma basis. An important milestone to note is that our organic Travel Nurse volumes are expected to be up about 20% over prior year. The Physician businesses are expected to experience their typical seasonal trends with mid-single-digit sequential decline. The Home Healthcare business is expected to experience a slight decline sequentially as well primarily due to the disruptive effects of the office closure in Colorado. Overall, we expect consolidated revenues in the fourth quarter to between $215 million and $220 million, which is essentially flat on a pro forma basis compared with the third quarter. As we mentioned in the earnings press release issued earlier today, we expect gross margins to increase nominally due to the inclusion of Medfinders for a full quarter. For this same reason, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to increase similarly. And with that, we'd now like to open up the call for questions."
63,GV_144520_2011Q3,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AMN Healthcare Q3 2011 Earnings Call. [Operator instructions] And today’s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Amy Chang. Please go ahead. Amy C. Chang Former Vice President of Investor Relations Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to AMN Healthcare’s Q3 2011 earnings call. A replay of this webcast will be available at and will be available until November 25, 2011. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may, and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, and other periodic reports which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company’s current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. On the call today are Susan Salka, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Brian Scott, our Chief Financial Officer. Joining us during the Q&A session will be Ralph Henderson, our President of Nurse and Allied staffing, and Bob Livonius, our President of Workforce Solutions. I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thanks so much, Amy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s 2011 third quarter earnings conference call. We are pleased to report our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth with consolidated third quarter revenues of $242 million, which is up 3% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, consolidated revenues were up 11% over prior year. In addition to the top line growth over the past year, we have also experienced improvements in gross margin and reductions in SG&A as a percentage of revenue. This leverage has translated into an increase in our adjusted EBITDA margin. A significant driver of our improved leverage has come from the benefits of our growing MSP client base. Our business trends and our outlook haven’t changed significantly since we reported earnings in August. Our strongest driver of growth to date continues to be our travel nurse business which still has a lot of runway for growth since we have only returned to approximately half of the pre-recession volumes. We do however expect growth in all of our staffing and workforce solution businesses in 2012 and beyond. This is driven largely by the continued aging demographic shift and the increased utilization created by healthcare reform. This increasing growth in demand for healthcare professionals was revalidated by the recently-published bipartisan Health Project Report which was on future challenges in healthcare workforce planning. The report lays out the daunting equation of expected 23% growth in healthcare jobs from 2008 until 2018, which contrasts with the significantly slower-growing workforce supply. Not surprisingly, the demand for nurses is leading the way but significant growth in demand for physicians and Allied providers is also cited. The report points out that this growth in demand is at odds with the workforce supply constraints such as the aging clinical population itself, a preference by younger professionals to work fewer hours, and the lack of additional capacity in the education and training systems. These trends are temporarily being masked by the uncertain and challenging economic environment but they will become increasingly evident as the macro factors improve and the magnitude of the demand growth simply overtakes the already stretched capacity of the workforce. With these trends in sight we continue to evolve our business model and our service offerings to help our clients to deal with this increasing challenge of access to talent, workforce planning and simultaneously reducing costs. We believe that our continued growth in overall market share and our industry-leading and improving business results are a positive sign that our differentiated value proposition is resonating with clients. So now let’s turn to our current results and talk about the short-term trends. While overall things are going well you’ll see that we also believe that there is room for improvement going forward. For the third quarter, nurse and Allied revenues were $148 million, up 6% sequentially and marking the seventh consecutive quarter of growth in our largest business segment. Year-over-year revenues were up 59% on an as-reported basis and up 24% on a pro forma basis. This growth was driven mainly by the travel nurse business, where revenues were up 6% sequentially and 33% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As of today, travel nurse orders are still up approximately 50% year-over-year and have been relatively steady since Q3. We continue to be successful in winning new MSP clients. So far during the second half of the year we have executed new contracts with an estimated gross spend under management of over $35 million. Approximately 90% of this is incremental revenue opportunity. At 3 of these contracts we replaced an incumbent MSP provider and in all 3 cases, our contract included improved rates and financial terms. These recent wins reflect continued opportunity for future market share gains and recognition of our stronger value proposition and fulfillment capabilities. Our larger national network of candidates and the very important affiliate vendors we work with are also critical during a time of growing demand and tight supply of candidates. In addition to attracting new supply of candidates into the travel industry, an important part of expanding our available candidate pool is through extensions and repeat travelers. The quality and the quantity of our available assignments has improved the opportunity for nurses to take repeat assignments with us, and this has translated into improving rebook rates. Our rebook rates during Q3 are at the highest levels we’ve seen since Q2 2008. The number of unique new candidates has also improved, with new applications up 11% sequentially in Q3. Q3 travel nurse average bill rates were up nearly 2% sequentially as we began to see a benefit from increases that were put in place since the beginning of the year. We do expect to make modest but continued progress on bill rates and gross margin spreads in the coming quarters. Our local staffing offices continue to be a contributor to our success in winning and filling MSP business. Q3 revenues for local staffing were $24 million, which was up 1% sequentially and 16% over prior year on a pro forma basis. The year-over-year growth was driven primarily by increased fill rates at new and existing MSP clients. We also experienced modest sequential Q3 increases in supply. Going into Q4, we continue to see volume growth which is driven primarily by the recent implementations of new MSPs as well as the normal seasonal flu business. Q3 Allied revenue was $31 million, which was up 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. The sequential improvement was driven primarily by an increase in productivity by the Allied Team now that the integration is fully behind us. The majority of our volume growth, both year-over- year and sequentially, was in our therapy business with modest growth in our imaging, radiology, and lab businesses. We do expect to experience a typical seasonal decline in Q4 due to fewer billing days since many of our clients run at reduced service levels during the holidays. Our Locum Tenens segment delivered Q3 revenues of $72 million, up 1% sequentially and down 4% year- over-year on a pro forma basis. As you may recall, we originally expected this segment to grow at least 3% sequentially during Q3. The shortfall came primarily from lower than expected fill rates as well as softer than expected demand in behavioral health and radiology. Primary care, anesthesia and emergency medicine experienced sequential volume increases during the quarter, however these were offset by declines in other specialties. Overall days sold were down slightly in Q3 and this is in line with the typical downward seasonality we anticipate in Q4. In addition to our focus on improving fill rates, we believe there is also opportunity to improve bill rates and to expand gross margin across most of our Locum specialties. In physician permanent placement, Q3 revenues were $9 million, down 3% sequentially and flat year- over-year on a pro forma basis. Without the impact of the deferred revenue accounting changes, revenue would have been up 1% sequentially and up 1% year-over-year. The physician search market has been steady but is still not growing. While hospitals are hiring more physicians, many of them have significantly increased their internal recruiting resources. We are making greater efforts and progress to partner with these clients to augment their internal efforts and we are working hard to attract supply through more innovative social media channels. In Q3, revenues from home healthcare services were $13 million, representing a 5% sequential decrease and an 8% year-over-year pro forma decrease. These results are indicative of the challenges of predicting the impact of regulatory and funding changes in the home health industry. Although home healthcare will play an increasingly important role in the transformation of patient care, we believe that future success in this industry would require further investment to create great economies of scale. As we mentioned in our press release, we have signed a non-binding letter of intent with a strategic buyer to acquire our 19 home healthcare offices. The potential buyer is a very reputable, large, privately held home healthcare company with a complementary business model and mix. Such a combination would allow them to create further synergies and economies of scale that were not as readily achievable by AMN. We intend to execute an agreement with this buyer during Q4 with a target close date during Q1 2012. AMN will continue to own and utilize the Nursefinders brand name for our local staffing and franchise operations. As the regulatory environment continues to drive transformation in healthcare, hospitals are seeking sophisticated and innovative solutions to manage key operating drivers such as their clinical workforce. In a recent staffing industry analyst survey, it was reported that the current penetration rate of healthcare staffing MSPs in large hospital systems is 10%, and now they’re anticipating that number to grow to 40% over the next 2 years. That would be a three-fold increase in just 2 years. Likewise, they reported that the penetration rate of RPO is expected to grow from minimal today to over 20% in the next 2 years. As the recognized industry leader and innovator in MSP and RPO, we believe that AMN is very well positioned to meet these growing needs of our clients. Before I turn the call over to Brian I would like to thank our team members for their strong continuing efforts to build our market share and our leadership position. We know that a very, very important differentiator in the market is our team members. Their passion, their talent, and their daily commitment to our clients and to the company make our strategy a reality. With our recent integration now behind us, the team is more focused than ever on solid execution, particularly around growing market share, tightly managing pricing and margins, and improving our operating leverage. I will come back to you in our Q&A section with Bob and Ralph to help further answer your questions, but for now I will turn the call over to our CFO, Brian Scott. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. As Susan mentioned, Q3 revenue was $242.3 million. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.4%, up 100 basis points from last year and up 70 basis points from the last quarter. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to $1.1 million of favorable worker’s compensation adjustments in Q3 based on better claims experience. Excluding these adjustments, gross margin was up 20 basis points sequentially and 50 basis points year-over-year. This gross margin improvement was driven in large part by increasing bill rates on relatively stable direct costs. SG&A in the quarter totaled $53.8 million, which included $200,000 of costs associated with the integration of Medfinders. Excluding integration expenses, SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 22.1% decreased from the prior year by 90 basis points and increased 20 basis points sequentially. The sequential increase in SG&A of about $2 million was related to several factors: first, we completed the wind down of operations in our U.K. office, which resulted in about $400,000 of one-time costs in the quarter. Q3 also included the impact of merit increases granted in July and higher professional liability costs related to both volume growth and higher than usual adverse development in our self-insurance reserves. In addition, we added headcount to support growth in our business with the majority related to the implementation of several large new MSP contracts. With an expectation of normal levels of professional liability expense and no ongoing U.K. office operating costs, we expect SG&A in Q4 to decline in absolute dollars but increase on a percentage basis due to the seasonally lower revenue. We are anticipating that Q4 SG&A will include integration costs of about $400,000. This will be the last quarter that we will call out any Medfinders integration-related expenses. Our nurse and Allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 6% to $147.7 million. Volume grew 3% sequentially to 5,300 healthcare professionals and revenue per day was up 2% on higher sequential bill rates and a small increase of average hours worked. Nurse and Allied gross margin increased sequentially by 80 basis points to 26.6% due in large part to the previously-noted worker’s compensation adjustment, a great deal of which benefited this segment, as well as improved bill pay spread. Q3 nurse and Allied operating income was $15.2 million or 10.3% of revenue, as compared to $14.4 million or the same 10.3% of revenue in the prior quarter. The flat operating margin was due to the previously-noted SG&A increases offsetting the higher gross margin. The operating margin improved by 110 basis points year-over-year due in large part to cost synergies from integrating the Medfinders travel nurse and Allied businesses and improved operating leverage. Our Locum Tenens segment revenue increased by 1% from the prior quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in days filled. Gross margin of 26% was up 70 basis points from the prior year due mainly to the addition of the higher-margin Medfinders locums business and some improvement in bill pay spread. The gross margin was sequentially up by 50 basis points due to the higher bill pay spread. Locum’s operating income of $6.3 million or 8.7% of revenues compares to $5.5 million or 7.7% in the prior quarter, with the increase related to the higher gross margin and some SG&A leverage. Within our physician permanent placement segment, revenue declined sequentially by 3% due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards effective January 1st. We recognized approximately $2.1 million of revenue in Q1, $0.7 million in Q2, and $0.4 million in Q3 that would have been deferred under the old standard. Excluding the impact of this change revenue increased both year-over-year and sequentially by 1%. Physician permanent placement operating income for Q3 was $2.1 million, or 23.3% of revenue. As of the end of Q3, the impact from the adoption of the revenue recognition standard is now substantially complete. Our home healthcare segment generated revenue of $13.3 million and operating income of $0.7 million for the quarter. Gross margin on this business was 38%, an increase of 350 basis points from the prior quarter due primarily to the worker’s compensation benefit. As the recent federal and state regulatory and reimbursement changes have had a more severe than expected impact on our home health business and the entire industry, we’ve lowered our near-term projections for the home healthcare segment which prompted us to perform an impairment test during Q3. Based on this assessment we recorded a noncash goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge of $31.2 million. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation and integration expenses, in Q3 was $7.5 million, consistent with the prior quarter and higher than the prior year expense of $6.4 million. The increase compared to the prior year is due to the addition of Medfinders, partially offset by cost synergies achieved through integrating the companies. As I mentioned in the last call, in July we executed an amendment to our credit facility. In conjunction with the amendment, the company incurred fees of approximately $2 million. We recorded $1.1 million of these fees as interest expense in Q3 and capitalized the remaining $0.9 million as debt issuance costs to be amortized over the remaining term of the credit facility. We reported a net loss before income tax of $27.3 million for Q3 due to the impairment charges. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit with a GAAP tax rate significantly impacted by a large portion of the impairment charges being permanently nondeductible for tax purposes. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter and projected full year, which excludes the charges associated with the impairment, integration, and credit facility amendment, is approximately 56%. Also, excluding the impairment charge from the calculation of pre-tax income our full year cash tax rate is anticipated to be less than 20% due to utilization of the NOLs that came with the Medfinders acquisition. On a GAAP basis we reported a net loss of $0.67 per diluted share. Excluding the impairment, integration and credit facility amendment costs, adjusted earnings per share in Q3 was $0.05. Q3 operating cash flow was $4.9 million and days sales outstanding were 55 days compared to 54 days in the last quarter. Capital expenditures for Q3 were $1.1 million and are expected to be a similar amount in Q4. As of September 30th our cash and equivalents totaled $4.6 million and our total debt outstanding under our credit agreement, net of discount, was $209.6 million. Going into Q4, most of our business segments will experience typical seasonal declines with the exception of the nurse and Allied staffing segment, which is expected to be flat sequentially. On a consolidated basis, Q4 revenues are expected to be between $232 million and $236 million. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27.5% and 28%. SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately 22.5% of revenues, and as a result, adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 6%. And with that we’d like to open up the call for questions."

We make available additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures in the earnings release and on the company's website. On the call today are, Susan Salka, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as Brian Scott, our Chief Financial Officer. Joining us during Q&A will be Ralph Henderson, our President of Healthcare Staffing and Bob Livonius, our President of Strategic Workforce Solutions. I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Amy. Good afternoon and welcome to AMN Healthcare's 2012 third quarter earnings conference call. I would like to start by thanking everyone for joining us on the call today, especially given the storm activity that occurred earlier this week. We know that many of you as well as some of our clients, patients, clinicians and team members have been affected both personally and professionally. The New York City hospitals are collaborating to ensure that patient care and proper staffing is their top priorities. We are working with multiple facilities to deploy temporary and permanent nurses to where they are needed most. Our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted and we wish all a speedy recovery and return to their everyday activities. Despite the challenges occurring earlier this week, we do have some good news to share with you today. As you will hear in our discussion, AMN Healthcare is on track with our strategy to expand our leadership position as the nation's innovator and healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services. The third quarter marked yet another solid financial performance with revenue, growth, profit and adjusted EBITDA all growing sequentially year-over-year and meeting or exceeding the company's guidance. These results reflect the benefit of our leadership position in providing managed services programs. They are also a reflection of the outstanding efforts of our sales and service team. Due to our strong delivery reputation, we believe we are extremely well positioned for the continued momentum we are seeing in the demand for workforce solutions. The benefits of this growth and the profitability of our delivery model, also enable us to continue improving the leverage of our core staffing businesses. At the same time, we firmly believe that greater market demand lies ahead in the next few years, so it is imperative that we make strategic investments today to ensure we are increasing our ability to recruit more candidates for the future. We will discuss these and other important investments we are making later in the call. But, let's turn first to the results of the third quarter. AMN Healthcare's consolidated revenue was $244 million, which exceeded our guidance range and was up 7% year-over-year and 3%, sequentially. We also achieved a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.7%, which was slightly better than anticipated. Our recent performance has been driven by several key factors. First, it is clear that our evolution from being the leader in healthcare staffing to now also be known as the innovator and workforce solutions is paying off. Managed services programs provide our clients with measurable cost efficiencies and quality improvements. These are 2 areas of great focus today and in the future, but this growth in MSP relationships has also been very good for AMN. Over the last 3 years, we have been able to boost our market share and improve operating leverage in the Nurse and Allied segment. This is primarily a result of the efficiency of higher fill rates with our MSP clients, which are typically double compared to traditional accounts. Our sales pipeline line for MSP opportunities continues to be robust. We are on pace to close a similar or greater number of new MSP accounts than we did last year. These new MSP accounts are expected to have the same or better gross billings opportunity. We also recently renewed 2 our largest MSP clients for multi- year contracts. As we have been predicting, we begun to see the MSP trend increase in our Allied, and begin to gain traction within the locum tenens market. Just last month, for example, we signed a new MSP contract with one of the nation's largest providers of contract rehab therapy services. The recruitment and availability of allied clinicians is vital to their ability to grow and deliver quality patient care. This is one of the largest allied MSPs that we are aware of and it has expected gross billings of over $25 million annually once fully implemented. In addition to adding some new locum tenens MSP clients, we were also recently selected to be the single source provider of locum tenens staffing service and MSPs by Novation, the nation's largest healthcare group purchasing organization. AMN has been a Novation supplier in Nurse and Allied for several years and we were named their 2011 purchase services supplier of the year for our commitment to delivering exceptional value and quality. During the last few years, this has been a valuable relationship for AMN and instrumental in winning several of our Nurse and Allied MSPs. We anticipate this expanded relationship will be beneficial in helping us to build our locums MSP client base. Another key factor in our recent strong performance and differentiated value is our ability to provide clients with the right combination of workforce solutions they seek. Our recent example is a Texas hospital system and longtime staffing client who signed an MSP contract for nursing and local staffing with us last year and then they expanded into allied. We were also engaged by the client to perform consulting services, where cost savings were identified for them by addressing staffing and efficiencies. Last month, we also added locum tenens services to this MSP. Examples like this are important proof points in our ability to become a more holistic partner with our clients. Now, let's get into the details of our results by business segment. Third quarter Nurse and Allied staffing revenue was $166 million, up 13% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. This growth was slightly better than expected in our guidance and was driven in large part by the travel nurse business, where volume was up 19% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially. The travel nurse growth was driven by modest order growth; strong fill rates, strong rebook rates and increased sourcing spend to growth the supply of nurse candidates. Clients with orders and clients with clinicians on assignment were also up both, year-over-year and sequentially. Going into the fourth quarter, strong bookings have continued and we expect to see our travel nurse volume up 20% year-over-year. Turning now to local staffing, third quarter revenue was down 7%, compared to the prior year, but up 5%, sequentially. The lower year-over-year revenue was due primarily to the office closures that took place in the fourth quarter of last year. Despite lower demand and supply constraints in certain markets, the business is stabilizing. The third quarter saw 1% to 2% sequential improvements in working nurses, bill rates and accounts with revenue. This quarter, we also made a leadership change and promoted Becky Kahn to President of Local Staffing and Strategic Accounts. Becky has been with AMN for over 10 years in key sales and operational leadership roles within the travel nurse business. She has a proven track record in building strong relationships with our clients, which is key in the local staffing business. We are confident that Becky will bring the same leadership strength and ultimate success to the local staffing division. Third quarter Allied revenue was up 11% year-over-year and 5%, sequentially with growth occurring across most specialties. The allied team continued to deliver strong fill rates, rebook rates and improvements in sales productivity. Going into the fourth quarter, we anticipate over 10% revenue growth year-over-year, but slightly lower revenues on a sequential basis due to the typical holiday seasonality. Locum tenens third quarter revenue was $68 million, down 6% year-over-year and flat, sequentially. Gross margins improved by 240 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points, sequentially. This was due primarily to improved bill pay spreads resulting from our recent margin enhancement initiative. The year-over-year revenue decline was driven mainly by radiology and anesthesia, both of which have experienced significant declines within the market and our specialties, where AMN is over-rated relative to the industry. Going into the fourth quarter, overall locum's revenue is expected to be down sequentially in the mid to high single-digit due to typical seasonality. We believe our locums business has significantly more opportunity to improve volumes, pricing and margin management. The team continues to make good, steady progress towards our goal of achieving consistent year-over-year increases in revenue and double- digit EBITDA margin. In physician permanent placement, third quarter revenue was $10 million, up 9% year-over-year and 4%, sequentially. We are very pleased with the progress of this business segment and how our teams are creating stronger relationships and ongoing search opportunities across various healthcare provider settings. In the third quarter, new retained searches were up significantly year-over-year due to an improved demand environment and increased market or headcount. However, some of the contracts are large search agreements which take longer to activate and will have less near-term impact on placement. We anticipate fourth quarter physician perm revenue will be up in the low single digits year-over-year and down, sequentially, due to normal holiday seasonality. Our leading industry position and overall improving financial performance is also enabling AMN to make important investments to fuel our long-term growth. These investments will enable us to continue building our market share, our workforce solutions capabilities and the supply of quality clinicians to meet the accelerated demand for healthcare labor that is anticipated. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, not only will the nation's overall population increase by 10% between 2010 and 2020, but the number age 65 and older will increase by 36%. This is expected to significantly accelerate the demand for healthcare services since the rate of hospital stays for those aged 65 and over is 3x more and the number of annual physician office visits is double for this age group. At the same time, our educational system will not keep pace with the number of clinicians and physicians that retire. Another driver of future demand is healthcare reform, which is anticipated to increase the number of people with access to health insurance by 30 million over the next 5 years. To position AMN to capitalize on these future demand trends, we are making strategic investments, which we believe will pay off in both, the short-term and the long-term. The first area of investment is in our innovative recruitment approaches centered around, mobile, online and social media technologies to aggressively drive more candidate supply. The second is in the continued differentiation and expansion of our workforce solutions offering to meet the evolving needs of our healthcare organization. And over the next year, we will also increase our technology infrastructure investment to ensure that we have a scalable, more efficient and agile platform from which to deliver best- in-class service to our clients and clinicians. We feel confident in the demand growth expected over the next few years and we believe these investments will further set us apart and enable us to more efficiently deliver the quality and quantity of clinicians our clients need. This higher level of SG&A spending from these initiatives is expected to be an important contributor in our ability to continue driving industry leading revenue growth and improve our operating leverage. The solid performance we are reporting today and the continued progress on our workforce solutions is a direct result of the passion commitment and solid execution of our outstanding team. I would like to recognize and thank our AMN team members for their continued focus and drive for excellence. It is this level of talent and engagement combined with our clear and differentiated strategy that has set us apart in the marketplace and ultimately enables us to deliver more shareholder value. I will come back to you in our Q&A section along with Ralph and Bob to help answer your questions, but for now I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter revenue was $243.9 million, up 6.5% from last year and 3.4% from last quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.5%, up 70 basis points from last year and up 10 basis points from the last quarter. The year over year and sequential increase was due to an improvement in the bill to pay spread and locum tenens segment, and an increased gross margin in the physician permanent placement segment, with the generally stable gross margin in the nurse and allied segment. The fourth quarter gross margin is expected to be down slightly due to both, normal seasonality and an increase in workers' compensation rates impacting the nurse and allied segments. SG&A in the quarter totaled $52.4 million, or 21.5% of revenue, compared to 21.6% in the same quarter last year and 21.3% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year percentage change was due to improved SG&A leverage and lower bad debt expense partly offset by the increased spending on strategic initiatives to grow candidate supply and expand our workforce solutions. We also incurred some severance costs related to ongoing back-office efficiency projects and the leadership change made in our local staffing business. The sequential increase in SG&A spending was driven by these costs along with increased headcount and commission and bonus cost tied to business growth. Our nurse and allied segment revenue increased 12.6% from the prior year and sequentially by 4.9% to 166.3 million. Volume grew 11% year-over-year and 5.2% sequentially to 5,884 average clinicians on assignment. Revenue per day was up 1.4% year-over-year and down 1.4%, sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily the result of slightly lower average hours worked. Nurse and allied gross margin of 26.5% was lower year-over-year by 10 basis points with improved bill pay spreads being offset by higher housing cost and the prior year workers' compensation actuarial benefit. Gross margin declined sequentially by 20 basis points and a small increase in direct costs. Third quarter nurse and allied operating income was $18.8 million, or 11.3% of revenue. The operating margin was 100 basis points higher than prior year on improved leverage and 30 basis points lower than in prior quarter due mainly to the lower gross margin. Our locum tenens segment revenue of $67.6 million was 6.2% below prior year and flat, sequentially. With the sequential results reflecting a 1.9% decrease in days filled offset by an equal increase in revenue per day filled on higher average fill rates. Gross margin of 28.4% was up 240 basis points from the prior year, and sequentially by 50 basis points due primarily to improved bill pay spreads. The locum tenens segment reported operating income of $6.3 million, or 9.3% of revenue, 60 basis points higher than in prior year and 30 basis points better than the prior quarter. Within our physician permanent placement segment, revenue increased year-over-year by 8.7% and sequentially by 4.3%. Gross margin improved by 360 basis points from the prior year and 420 basis points from prior quarter mainly as a result of higher billable recruiter productivity and lower candidate sourcing cost. Physician permanent placement operating income for the third quarter was $2.2 million or 22% of revenue, down 130 basis points from prior year and higher by 230 basis points from the prior quarter. SG&A expense in the quarter was $3.7 million, which compares to $7 million last year and $13.6 million last quarter. The second quarter included $9.8 million of cash and non-cash cost related to refinancing our credit facility. For the fourth quarter, we expect interest expense to be approximately $3.2 million. Our tax rate in the quarter was 42%, slightly lower than our full year and fourth quarter projected tax rate of 44%. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.12. Excluding the impact of debt refinancing and amendment cost and Medfinders integration expense in the prior year, adjusted EPS was $0.11 in the prior quarter and $0.04 in the prior year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $11.5 million and capital expenditures for the third quarter were $1.5 million. Day sales outstanding were 54 days, compared to 53 days in the last quarter and 55 days in the same quarter last year. As of September 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $3.8 million and our total debt outstanding net of discount was $170 million. Our debt to LTM ratio is calculated for our credit agreement was 2.6x. The company made $24 million in voluntary debt prepayments during the third quarter and has made an additional $12 million in prepayment subsequent to quarter end, bringing our debt balance as of today to $158 million. Now, let's turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. Consolidated revenue is expected to be between $240 million and $244 million, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 8% to 10%. This guidance incorporates the impact of Hurricane Sandy, including some lost revenue and the potential delay of an EMR project in the Northeast. Gross margins are expected to be approximately 28% to 28.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be approximately 21.5%, which includes continued investments of about $1.0 million for the previously known strategic investments. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 7.5%. With that, we'd like to open the call for questions."

Good afternoon, Happy Halloween and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. AMN’s leadership position as the innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services continues to be a differentiator for our clients. As healthcare providers navigate through a climate of weaker census and budgetary pressures, they are seeking trusted partners, who can enable them to create more flexible workforce models, that also help them achieve their patient care and financial goals. In particular, AMN’s strength in providing MSP, RPO and EMR staffing services, coupled with our scale and execution, has enabled the company to deliver strong performance. We continue to make important investments in our people, processes, technology and potential new products and services. These investments are critical to ensure that AMN evolves to meet the changing needs of our current and new clients. Our ability and willingness to make these kinds of investments are a key reason for our #1 market position, and we are committed to leading our industry in client-focused innovation. More on this later, but let’s first talk about our current results. In the third quarter, AMN consolidated revenue grew by 5%, with all business segments delivering year- over-year increases. Gross margin increased by 90 basis points over prior year to 29.4%. We continued to achieve leverage with adjusted EBITDA growing at a rate 3x faster than revenue. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 8.4%, a 70 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year. A key part of our strategy is to continue expanding our leadership position, by aggressively winning and implementing managed services programs. The closer relationships and the higher fill rates we achieve through MSP contracts enables us to grow faster during periods of market expansion and provide some protection during periods of demand softness. In the third quarter, MSP contracts represented approximately 30% of our consolidated revenues. In addition, 7 MSP clients went live during the third quarter, and 10 others are currently in the implementation stage. Another workforce solution we continue to make progress in is Recruitment Process Outsourcing. Our RPO program was recently recognized by HRO Today, as ranked #1 in their inaugural healthcare Baker's Dozen Award for outstanding quality and customer service. We anticipate ample runway for us to continue to expand in value-added services, such as MSP and RPO, in the coming years. Now let’s review the results of our 3 business segments. I'll start first with our largest segment of Nurse and Allied Staffing, which has been the most affected by the softer census numbers and reimbursement changes put into place over the last year. Despite a tepid demand environment, third quarter revenue for this segment was up 3% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The largest contributor was the travel nurse business, where volume was up 2% year-over-year and revenue per traveler per day was up 5%. These increases were due mainly to higher EMR staffing revenue, which hit a record high in the third quarter. Overall, our traditional travel nurse clients continue to have a more cautious mindset, due to the effect of sequestration, budgetary concerns and soft hospital census. Throughout the third quarter, travel nurse demand was at or below prior year levels. Throughout October however, orders have strengthened and have generally been above prior year levels and are up nearly 20% over the prior month. For the fourth quarter, we expect travel nurse revenue to be down 3% to 4% year-over-year and sequentially. The year-over-year decrease is due to the relative softness in demand and the sequential decline is due to fewer EMR conversion projects, which is very typical during the holidays, and offset the growth, which was in our traditional travel nurse business. These same demand triggers are also affecting local staffing, where third quarter revenue was down 6% compared to prior year and 3% sequentially. In addition to the lower census and cautious hiring by our clients, this business was also impacted by our closing of 5 lower performing branches. Fourth quarter revenues for local staffing are also expected to be down, both year-over-year and sequentially. Now turning to Allied Staffing. Third quarter Allied revenue was down 12% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, driven by the decline in therapy demand, offset by increases in the imaging lab and pharmacy specialties. To address the reimbursement challenges in therapy, our resources have been realigned and the team is focused on expanding our MSP footprint, increasing fill rates, and targeting the less impacted acute care and home health settings. Going into the fourth quarter, Allied staffing revenue is expected to be down in the mid teens year-over- year and in the high-single digits sequentially, due to the lower therapy demand and normal seasonal trends. Overall for the Nurse and Allied Staffing segment, we expect fourth quarter revenues to be down in the mid-single digits, both year-over-year and sequentially. Despite the mixed demand trends and cautious client mindset, we believe that we will weather this temporary weakness better than most, due to our leadership position in MSP. We now turn to the Locum Tenens segment, which has become a real bright spot, with third quarter revenue increasing 11% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. This performance represented a third consecutive quarter of both year-over-year and sequential revenue growth. The year-over-year revenue improvement was driven mainly by a strong demand environment and solid execution, leading to growth in the hospitalist, advanced practice, primary care and behavioral health specialties. Overall days available grew by 10% over the prior year, helping to fuel the growth. Gross margin of 29.3% was also a record high, representing an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially, due to improved pricing and bill pay spreads. These improvements enabled the division to achieve segment operating margin of 10%, a milestone for our Locum’s business. The division’s focus over the last 18 months to realign resources, focus on pricing and gross margin and be first to market in Locum’s MSP, continues to pay off. Our MSP revenue mix in Locums is still in the single digits, but we expect the penetration of Locums' MSP to increase, which is evidenced by our growing pipeline. Going into the fourth quarter, we expect the Locum segment to experience strong year-over-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, but be down sequentially in the low-single digits due to the normal holiday seasonality. Performance continues to be strong in our third segment of physician Permanent Placement, where revenue was up 9% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by solid performance and improved placements in our retained search business. The third quarter placements were at their highest level in the last 5 years. Based on new client wins and search activity, we expect fourth quarter Physician Perm revenue to be up in the mid-single digits year-over-year, and down slightly sequentially, which is a very typical seasonal trend. So while we feel good about our current overall performance, our sights are set on the future, and how we will continue to create innovative workforce solutions with our clients and improve our profitability through efficiency and scale. Over the next decade, many factors will influence how, when and where healthcare is delivered. There will be many targeted areas and experiments in new delivery models. Some will work and some won’t, but the common goal is to improve the overall value equation of cost and quality of care. A common ingredient in every care model is efficient utilization of a quality, appropriately skilled healthcare workforce. Because of these intensifying forces, healthcare executives are more open than ever to engaging with trusted partners, who can provide new solutions. AMN’s core competencies in recruitment, placement and credentialing, combined with our innovative culture and strong execution, position us very well to be that trusted partner. Despite the softer-than-expected hospital admissions during 2013, the demand for healthcare services is still generally anticipated to expand in 2014, as the impact of the Affordable Care Act unfolds. To ensure we are best positioned to be the partner of choice for clients, we continue to invest in 3 key areas. The first is expanding our suite of workforce solutions. The second is our leading-edge recruitment technology, such as job distribution and mobile platforms, to aggressively attract more candidate supply and create a better experience. And the third is the streamlining of our systems and infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. These investments are essential to delivering revenue growth and operating leverage as we progress towards our long term goal of a 10% adjusted EBITDA margin. The final key to AMN’s success in delivering shareholder value is our very passionate and talented team. They are committed to delivering a differentiated experience to our clients and clinicians every single day. With the team’s consistent and strong execution, AMN has set itself apart as the market leader and innovator. I will come back to you in our Q&A section along with Ralph and Bob, and for now, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. The company’s third quarter and adjusted EBITDA were at the high end of our guidance range, with revenue at $257.1 million, up 5.4% from last year, and 1.2% from last quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.4%, up 90 basis points from last year and 10 basis points from last quarter. The year-over-year and sequential increase was due mainly to margin improvement in both our Nurse and Allied, and Locum Tenens segments. SG&A in the quarter totaled $55.6 million or 21.6% of revenue, compared to 21.5% in the prior year and prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in SG&A expenses was due primarily to increased employee headcount, commissions and other expenses related to supporting growth in the business. Our third quarter Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased 2.8% from the prior year and 0.5% sequentially to $171 million. Volume of 5,771 average clinicians on assignment was lower by 1.9% year- over-year and 2.6% sequentially. Revenue per day was up 4.8% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, with our average bill rate higher by 1.8% over last year. Nurse and Allied gross margin of 27.4% was higher year-over-year by 90 basis points and sequentially by 20 basis points. The year-over-year improvement was due to lower insurance costs and a favorable business mix shift towards our higher margin service offering, such as RPO. Third quarter Nurse and Allied operating margin of 11.9% was higher by 60 basis points year-over-year, and 10 basis points in the prior quarter, with improvement driven primarily by the higher gross margin. Third quarter Locum Tenens segment revenue of $75.3 million was up 11.3% from prior year, and 3.5% sequentially. An increase in days sales drove the year-over-year increase, with an average bill rate increase of 3.4% year-over-year, offset by a mix shift to lower bill rate specialties. Gross margin of 29.3% was 90 basis points higher from the prior year, and 30 basis points higher sequentially, due primarily to improved bill pay spreads. Third quarter Locum Tenens operating margin of 10% was higher by 70 basis points year-over-year and 320 basis points from the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was due mainly to the gross margin improvement. The sequential increase was due to the higher gross margin and lower SG&A, as second quarter SG&A included an unfavorable $1.7 million professional liability reserve adjustment. Our third quarter Physician Permanent Placement segment revenue of $10.9 million was up year-over-year by 9%, but down 1.9% sequentially. Gross margin of 62.6% was lower by 150 basis points from the prior year and 10 basis points from the prior quarter, from an increase in recruiter headcount to drive future placement growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $21.5 million, representing 8.4% of revenue. This compares to $18.8 million or 7.7% of revenue in the prior year quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was $1.8 million, which compares to $3.7 million last year, and $3.1 million last quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was 42%, and we expect our tax rate for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 to be 41%. We reported net income of $8.6 million in the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.18 for the third quarter, which compares to $0.12 in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $26.6 million. The strong cash flow was driven in part by improved receivable collections, along with higher accrued compensation and other payables, due to timing of our quarter close date relative to our normal payment cycles. Days sales outstanding were 52 days compared to 54 days last quarter and last year. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $1.1 million. As of September 30, our cash and equivalents totaled $31.7 million and our total debt outstanding was $149 million. Our quarter end leverage ratio as calculated per our credit agreement was 1.9x as compared to 2.6x last year. Now let’s turn to our guidance for the fourth quarter. The company expects the typical fourth quarter seasonal decline, combined with a moderate demand environment in Nurse and Allied Staffing, to result in consolidated revenue between $246 million and $250 million. Gross margin is expected to be 29% to 29.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be approximately 22%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 8%. Fourth quarter interest expense will be $1.8 million, and capital expenditures are projected to be $4 million. Diluted share count is expected to be 47.8 million for the fourth quarter and the full year. And with that, we’d like to open up the call for questions."
66,GV_144520_2007Q4,"Presentation Unknown Speaker <strong>Operator</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the AMN Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Christopher Schwartz, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. <strong>Christopher Schwartz - Vice President of Investor Relations</strong> Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the AMN Healthcare Services conference call to discuss the Company's earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2007. For the call this afternoon, we have Susan Nowakowski, AMN's President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Dreyer, AMN's Chief Financial Officer. A replay of this webcast is available at amnhealthcare.com/investors and will be replayed until March 11, 2007. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as belief, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31st 2006, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31st of 2007, June 30, 2007, and September 30, 2007, and our current reports on Form 8-K, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the Company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to us. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The Company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. <strong>Susan Nowakowski - President and Chief Executive Officer</strong> Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in AMN Healthcare and in taking the time to participate in our earnings call. We will talk today primarily about our outlook for the industry and our market positioning. But we also want to provide you with some color on the full year and fourth quarter results for 2007. There are many things going well and opportunity for growth in all of our business segments. But as is true for most staffing companies today, we are not without some short-term challenges due to the uncertain economic conditions. This is a time when we believe our diversified service model helps AMN to expand our overall leadership position within the industry. Revenue for 2007 was a company and an industry record of 1.16 billion, an increase of 8% over 2006. While we did produce efficiencies in operations, these were partially offset particularly during the first half of the year by direct cost pressures causing diluted earnings per share to grow at a slower rate of 3% to a $1.05. While these results are less than our original expectations and certainly less than what we think the industry will achieve in the long-term, we do believe they are consistent, if not slightly higher than the organic growth rates for the overall healthcare staffing industry. The biggest driver of growth in 2007 came from our locum tenens staffing segment which produced 16% year-over-year growth in revenue. Nurse and allied staffing started off with strong volume and pricing growth but declined during the second half of the year due to weakening industry demand in certain large markets. While we remained very focussed on execution within our current service offerings, we also took this opportunity to invest in the expansion of our business by launching new clinical disciplines and leveraging acquisitions that have enabled us to further diversify and tap into high growth, high margin market niches. I'll talk more on this later. But first some detail on our individual business segments. As I mentioned, our nurse and allied staffing segments started out relatively strong during the first half of 2007, but did not produce the expected seasonal volume increases during the third and fourth quarters. This was largely due to softness in demand in some key markets such as California, Arizona and Florida. A more favorable reverse trend was in the gross margins, which were pressured for the first half of the year. But through careful management of expenses we were able to increase gross margins over 100 basis points in the third and the fourth quarters. Another contributor to the lower nurse volumes was the impact of a bottleneck immigration environment and the affect on our international nurse staffing division O'Grady Peyton. Although O'Grady Peyton is currently less than 5% of our overall revenues, the contraction of this business did cause a slight drag on our annual and fourth quarter results. As you may know, the availability of visas has been significantly restricted for over a year now and the lobbying efforts by the hospital community and the healthcare staffing industry to get the situation fixed have been unsuccessful due to the current political environment. Due to lack of progress on this issue we are not anticipating a legislative solution in 2008. If we get release sooner great, but in the meantime we've taken steps to restructure our operations to align our business with the lower international volume we’re forecasting. We're optimistic that this issue will be resolved in the long-term as foreign educated nurses are significant source of staffing for healthcare facilities nationwide. In fact, foreign trained nurses represent almost one out of every six nurses who passed the NCLEX exam in 2007. Well, in aggregate, travel nurse demand has been below prior year levels, we still have more open orders than we have travelers coming off assignment each month. And there are several states where demand is higher than prior year. So this is not a national pervasive decline, but it is enough to have affected our volume growth in the short term. We are cautiously optimistic as demand trends including some of the states that I mentioned have improved over the past month and we seem to be on track to close the year- over-year gap. To that point just since January our orders are up about 20% and the number of units with orders is also up 20%, and the number of facilities with orders is up about 8%. This has helped drive stronger placement volume which is now up about 7% year-over-year through February. While growing travelers on assignment has been challenging, we’re pleased that average bill rates and re-negotiated pricing levels have remained in line with our expectations. And we still believe that there is opportunity for continued bill rate increases in 2008. Our current expectations are to negotiate bill rate increases in the three to five percent range. Within our allied staffing business, the fastest growing disciplines are in rehab therapy areas such as physical and occupational therapist. However, our newer pharmacy staffing business also provides some nice opportunity for growth. The shortage of pharmacists for both retail and hospital employers is expected to severely deepen over the next decade and we believe that we're well positioned to help these employers with both temporary and permanent placement services. While allied healthcare staffing is still a relatively small piece of our overall business it is one of the fastest growing markets within the industry and we believe that with our leadership position and the synergies with our other staffing brands, we will be able to drive double-digit growth rates over the coming years. Turning to our locum tenens staffing business revenues grew 16% in 2007 compared to the prior year above industry expectations for this market. Day’s sales in 2007 reached a new record growing 10% over the prior year. We believe this is a strong indicator that Healthcare facility executives continue to recognize the importance of ensuring that they have sufficient resources to expand their revenues and maximize their margins. While short-term specialty demands can certainly fluctuate, the longer-term demand for contract physicians continues to grow at a high rate relative to other staffing markets in the industry. While we do not have enough supply to fill demand, the supply of new providers is growing at a healthy pace driven in part by the demographic factors of an ageing physician population and a generational shift towards part time work among younger physicians. The majority of our specialties experienced solid growth in days sales in 2007, with the greatest growth experienced in Primary Care, Radiology, and Surgery. Primary Care is still our largest division and has been a consistent contributor to our growth. However, during 2007, Radiology and Surgery were the fastest growing specialty divisions. The overall demand and supply trends remain strong and we are again expecting locum tenens staffing to be our fastest growing segment during 2008. During '07, we launched a new division in the placement of dentist. While this is still a relatively small piece of business today, we are very excited about the long-term growth opportunities in this new and emerging market. Just like physicians, there is an extreme shortage of dentist to serve the needs of the Asian population. We expect to invest more in this division in 2008, and it is likely to be one of our fasting growing specialties. Our physician perm placement segment finished 2007 with 51 million in revenue and gross margin of 61%, which was relatively flat to the prior year. We believe the lack of growth had less to do with external growth opportunities and more to do with internal changes. One indicator of demand is the growth in new searches. During the second half of '07, our team drove a 10% increase in new searches over the prior year, setting us up very well as we move into 2008. We continue to make investments to increase the number of producing recruiters to capitalize on this growing demand. The Merritt Hawkins brand is extremely well recognized and respected as a recruitment expert throughout the physician community, and we believe there are additional ways that we can leverage our expertise in recruitment model to help other employers who are seeking to improve their recruitment effectiveness. We are currently exploring some new service models that we believe can expand our long-term growth opportunities in this area. AMN Healthcare's strong commitment to high quality and superior client service is an important differentiator, and we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Recently, we conducted a third party anonymous survey of both current and perspective clients of travel nurse staffing services. The objective was to evaluate AMN's brands relative to our competitors. We were extremely encouraged by the survey findings. Clients ranked AMN significantly more favorable than our nearest competition in a number of key areas such as nurse quality and experience, contribution towards improved patient outcomes and clinical excellence. AMN also received the top scores in terms of our capability to fill needs quickly, customer responsiveness, reputation and trust, and competitive pricing. We are known first and foremost for the high quality professionals we place, but we are also recognized as being the most capable of helping Healthcare providers to manage the clinical labor needs. This recognition has enabled AMN to build leading physicians in the most attractive segments of our industry. Today, we are in a strong #1 position within travel nurse staffing. We are #1 in the fast growing segment of locum tenens. We are # 1 in the very profitable segment of physician permanent placement. And following our recent acquisition of Platinum Select, we are proud to be able to now claim the top spot in the attractive travel allied healthcare segment of the industry. This addition of Platinum Select to the AMN family provides an additional channel for helping our clients obtain the scarce and valuable talents of allied professionals. In addition to being accretive to 2008 earnings, Platinum Selects fits perfectly with our strategy of continuing to expand our service offering. The Platinum Select team has a very positive values based passion or culture and it’s led by a terrific management team. We feel fortunate to have them as part of AMN Healthcare. As we move into 2008, we are confident that AMN has the right market strategy and the right team in place to execute. However, we must continue to innovate and remained agile in order to further expand our leadership position. And with that, I would like turn the call over to our CFO David Dreyer. David? <strong>David Dreyer - Chief Financial Officer</strong> Well, thank you Susan and good afternoon. Before I discuss our fourth quarter results, I would like to recap on a few of it closing details of our recent acquisition of Platinum Select Staffing. We closed the transaction on February 15th, 2008. The total potential purchase price is up to 50.3 million in cash with the initial purchase price of 32.9 million and the potential additional earn up revision of up to 17.4 million based on Platinum Select achieving established 2008 revenue and EBITDA targets. We financed the acquisition using approximately 18 million of cash on hand and 15 million borrowed from our revolving credit facility. This borrowing increased our leverage ratio to 1.7 times at the date of close from a ratio of approximately 1.6 times at year-end. Now I would like to turn you attention to AMN's fourth quarter financial results. We’ve reported revenue of 286 million for the fourth quarter, which was slightly higher than the fourth quarter of last year and 5% lower than third quarter of '07. Diluted earnings per share was $0.26 this quarter as compared to $0.29 last quarter and Q4 last year. Yet the prior year quarter did include a $0.05 benefit due to a significant actuarial adjustment recorded to our professional liability insurance reserves. Revenue generated by our nurse and allied health care staffing segment this quarter was a 197 million compared to 202 million last year, and 204 million last quarter. While it's typical to experience the slight sequential decline from the third to fourth quarter, this was further impacted by the softening in demand which began mid year. This also contributed to the year-over-year decline. In addition, our international nurse division volume was lower by almost 200 year-over-year which made up almost 40% of the decrease for the quater. Revenue generated by our locum tenens staffing segment this quarter was 76 million, an increase of 12% compared to last year and a decrease of 8% from last quarter. The year-over-year increase in revenue was due to a 4% increase in days filled combined with an 8% increase in revenue per day sales. The sequential decrease in revenue was due mainly to a decrease in days filled. This shortfall in volume was primarily due to the seasonal impact of a year-end holiday combined with one less government billing day in the fourth quarter. Revenue for our physician permanent placement segment this quarter was 13 million which is flat compared to last year and last quarter. Looking forward for this segment, a recent increase in the number of producing sales team members and new searches is expected to result in revenue growth during 2008. Consolidated gross profit this quarter was 76 million, representing a gross margin of 26.6% which compared to 26.2% reported last year and 26.6% reported last quarter. The year-over-year increase in gross margin was due primarily to an improved pay-to-bill spread in the nurse and allied staffing segment. On a segment basis, gross margins for the fourth quarter were 24.4% for nurse and allied, 26.1% for locum tenens, and 61.8% for physician permanent placement. SG&A expenses this quarter were 56 million or 19.6% of revenue which compared to 18.1% last year and 18.6% last quarter. The increase in SG&A compared to last year was due mainly to a 2.9 million favorable adjustment to our insurance reserves in the fourth quarter 2006 and the restructuring charges of 700,000 taken during this fourth quarter related to downsizing our international division. Net interest expense this quarter was 2.9 million, down from 4 million last year and 3.1 million last quarter. These decreases are due to continued payments from our cash flow to reduce our debt outstanding. The income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 35.3% compared to 38.6% for the fourth quarter of last year with both quarters including adjustments required to finalize year-end federal and state tax provisions. The full year effective tax rate was 40% which approximate the rate that we anticipate for 2008. We had an average of 34.2 million fully diluted shares outstanding during the fourth quarter, and for the full year we had an average 34.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding. Turning to our financial position, this quarter we generated 25 million in operating cash flow and $80 million for the full year, which in addition to cash on hand was used to reduce debt outstanding by 27 million for the year and to repurchase one million shares of stock in the third quarter. Total debt outstanding at year-end was a 147 million resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.6 times. Day sales outstanding or DSO at the end of this quarter was 59 days compared to 63 days last year and 60 days last quarter. The decrease in this quarters DSO reflects our continuing improvements on our collection efforts. Now, I would like to provide you with our revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2008. This guidance includes our expectations for Platinum Select beginning on February 15, 2008. First quarter revenue is expected to range from 290 to 293 million and diluted earnings per share is expected to range from $0.24 to $0.26 which includes the impact of one fewer billing day in our nurse and allied segment in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. Revenue for the full year 2008 is expected to grow 7 to 12% from 2007 at a range from 1.25 to 1.30 billion. Our full year estimate assumes that 2008 experiences typical business trends for healthcare staffing namely; normal seasonal growth in demand and placements heading into the second half of the year. We anticipate the revenue mix by segment will remain relatively similar to 2007. We expect earnings per share in 2008 to range from a $1.16 to $1.22, which is an annual growth rate of 11 to 16%. This estimate includes a $0.01 accretion from Platinum Select, although, we believe that it may contribute more than that during the year. This concludes my financial overview. At this time, we'd like to open up the call to any questions you might have."
67,GV_144520_2008Q4,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the AMN Healthcare fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, with instructions being given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Christopher Powell. Please go ahead. Christopher Powell Good afternoon. I would like to welcome everyone to the AMN Healthcare Services conference call to discuss the company's earnings results for the fourth quarter 2008. For the call this afternoon, we have Susan Nowakowski, AMN's President and Chief Executive Officer, and David Dreyer, AMN's Chief Financial Officer. A replay of this web cast is available at amnhealthcare.com/Investors and will be available until March 12, 2009. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects can constitute forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may, and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections, or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result the various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, and our current reports on Form 8-K, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current beliefs and are based upon information currently available to it. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Nowakowski Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter earnings call. Companies that achieve sustainable leadership positions always balance between investments that will build a stronger, healthier company for the future while at the same time remaining agile and adjusting to the short-term market trends. In the current economic environment, striking this balance is more critical and more difficult than other. Fortunately, AMN Healthcare’s 24-year history and strong leadership position show our proven ability to strike this balance better than others in our field. Throughout previous economic recessions, AMN Healthcare has executed effectively, built market share, and emerged in a stronger leadership position. Our strategy of leveraging the advantages of our size, our differentiated business model, and our diversified service line, combined with our talented team and solid financial fundamentals give us the ability to be proactive in our market place. It was solid execution of this strategy by our employees that allowed AMN to increase our market share and achieve record revenue of $1.22 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $96 million, and $1.6 of pro forma diluted EPS in 2008. The nurse and allied segment experienced single digit growths that moderated throughout the year. Specifically, short-term nurse staffing experienced consistent year-over-year revenue growth of 2% to 3% over the past three quarters. Based on comments and reports from competitors and our own clients, it is clear that AMN has been expanding market share over the last year. Our broad and diversified client base enables us to better whether this market relative to the competition. To this point, in 2008, our top 10 clients in nurse and allied staffing accounted for only 9% of revenues in that segment. As hospitals reduce the number of staffing companies they use, we are well positioned to retain our slot as one of their providers and to gain market share. Our ability to offer the largest selection of assignments to nurse candidates becomes an even greater differentiator in a down market. While orders are significantly down, we believe we still have about twice as many assignments to offer than our closest competitors. Despite lower levels, there is still an overall consistent need from hospitals for clinical staff to serve the healthcare needs of the general population. During the earnings call of one of the major hospital systems, they mentioned that they will “continue to protect the labor at the bedside,” and that they will need more nurses next year than this year to take care of increasing volume level. Some competitors are forced to turn away high-quality candidates in today’s market because they just don’t have enough assignments to offer. Our larger selection of assignments also helps us to retain our existing working travelers. This strength was best reflected in the fourth quarter where our short-term nurse traveler count was flat with prior year as many competitors experienced declines. Our decline in overall nursing volume was due primarily to international nursing which was down about 200 nurses as we continue to feel the effects of user retrogression. The pricing environment remains relatively stable in nursing. During 2008, our average revenue per traveler per day increased by 3%, with the fourth quarter rising similarly over the prior year. On top of this, we have seen continued improvements in our housing and insurance costs allowing our short-term nursing business to achieve gross margin improvement of 60 basis points in 2008 over the prior year. In our allied division, we are positioned well in the long-term to serve the staffing disciplines that are projected to be the fastest growing, such as rehab therapy, laboratory, and pharmacy. During 2008, our rehab specialties experienced 9% growth. However, the allied industry continues to be impacted by the declines in the imaging specialties. In the fourth quarter, we also began to experience a drop in overall allied orders, although less significant than the drop in nursing. We continued to lead the locum tenens industry with revenues of $322 million or 4% higher than the prior year. Our revenue results were a combination of strong double-digit volume growth in behavioral health and dentistry as well as our largest specialty of primary care. This growth was offset by continued decline in radiology and some softness in surgery and anesthesia in the second half of 2008. Our aggregate days-filled volume improved 2% year over year and our revenue per day filled contributed the other 2%. Several of the physician divisions actually experienced stronger pricing growth, but these were offset by the pricing declines and relatively lower mix of radiology placements which typically have the highest daily bill rates. Gross margins for the year improved slightly at 26.3%, up 30 basis points over 2007, driven by improved bill-to-pay spread but partially offset by lower temp-to-perm placement fees. In 2008, our top 10 clients in locum tenens accounted for only 6% of revenues in that segment indicated our low client concentration. Going forward, we continue to see strong but moderating growth in primary care, behavioral health, and dentistry. However, there are some external trends such as fewer physician days, some physicians who are delaying their retirement, and pressure on state and county budgets that could affect the growth rate. In physician permanent placement, we reported 2008 revenues of $51 million which was flat with prior year. The consistent need for quality physicians to drive revenue and margin at healthcare facilities helps provide a more sustainable demand environment than experienced by permanent placement companies in other industries. For example, during recent earnings calls, major hospital systems reported that expanding their physician recruitment is a key strategy for gaining market share. One hospital’s CEO said, “I think our physician recruiting is probably the best thing we can do to increase market share.” According to another CEO, their success in the face of weak and mean economy was due in part to their success expanding their active physician staff. While the long-term drivers of our business remain well intact and potentially more compelling than ever, we must deal with the realities of a short-term and proactively adjust our infrastructure to the expected lower revenue and volumes. To this end, we have taken a number of steps to ensure we achieve operational efficiencies and are the right size to accommodate the decline in travel, nursing, and allied orders. We of course looked first externally to eliminate costs through lower spending with third party vendors. Those efforts have been very fruitful, and we will continue to pursue more external opportunities throughout the year, but our largest cost center is our employee expense. Over the past 3 months, we have implemented a variety of measures including minimal replacement for attrition and a reduction in our workforce. This week, we also announced the consolidation of three of our smaller nursing recruitment brands which will result in lower future operating expenses including a further reduction in our workforce and the closing of our Huntersville, NC office. These initiatives to streamline our travel nursing operations by consolidating physical locations and rationalizing our 8 travel nurse brands down to 5, we decided in conjunction with a long-term strategic brand study that we launched in 2008. As part of the study, we surveyed over 3200 current, former, and prospective clients and healthcare professionals. The results confirm that AMN Healthcare has significantly higher overall brand ratings than our competitors. Specifically, we were rated particularly high as having an excellent reputation, being easy to work with, being innovative, and filling assignments quickly. Although we are adjusting our infrastructure and redeploying resources to reflect the current market conditions, we have also been careful to continue supporting initiatives that diversity our product lines and broaden our client base for the future. During 2008, we launched 3 important new service offerings including recruitment process outsourcing and staffing services in the home health market and ambulatory surgery centers. The recently announced economic stimulus package and proposed federal budget includes significantly healthcare related spending that will likely drive increased need for physicians and nurses, although the timing and magnitude of that impact is certainly very difficult to predict. A large portion of this spending is focused on increasing access to healthcare services. Also, there is a long-term funding towards health information technology. We believe that this will also drive an increased demand for temporary physicians and nurses as hospitals implement new systems. In fact, this past year, we have already worked with a number of clients who have begun such technology instillations. As a thought leader in the industry, we believe it is very important that we stay on top of these and other trends. As such, we are excited to mention that in December 31, 2008, Dr. Michael John, Chancellor of Emory University in Atlanta joined AMN’s Board of Directors. Dr. John has previously led Emory University’s Health Sciences Center which includes the schools of medicine, nursing, and public health along with Emory Healthcare, the largest healthcare system in Georgia. In addition, prior to Emory, he served as dean of the John Hopkins School of Medicine. We are very, very pleased to have Dr. John as a board member. With his deep knowledge of the healthcare system, he can further enable AMN Healthcare to continue being the industry thought leader. At this point, I would now like to turn the call over to David Dreyer, our CFO, who will give you more detail on our full year and fourth quarter results. David C. Dreyer Thank you, Susan and good afternoon. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $296 million, 3% higher than the same quarter last year and 6% lower than last quarter. The year-over-year increase was due mainly to the acquisition of Platinum Select Staffing last February along with volume growth in the locum tenens staffing segment. The sequential decrease in revenue was mainly from the lower volume in our nursing business that Susan discussed earlier. Fourth quarter revenue was within our revenue guidance given on October 30, 2008. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter was 25.7%, down 90 basis points from the same quarter last year and unchanged with the last quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven mostly by lower gross profit contribution from our higher margin businesses such as international nursing and physician permanent placement along with continued shift in the mixed specialties within our locum tenens staffing segment. Gross margin remained unchanged from the prior quarter despite a typical fourth quarter seasonal downward trend as travelers end assignments early for the holidays. SG&A, as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter, was 18.6% down 100 basis points from last year and 50 basis points from last quarter. The improvements were driven primarily by cost cutting initiatives starting during the fourth quarter along with favorable trends and bad debt and insurance expenses. SG&A was down 8% compared to the prior quarter, mostly in employee cost and third-party expenses as management slowed down hiring and spending. In addition, last quarter’s SG&A included a $1.6 million charge for restructuring and legal expenses associated with our pharmacy staffing division. Depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter was $3.6 million, slightly lower than prior quarter and up 12% over last year due mainly to the acquisition of Platinum Select. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter was $2.7 million, down 9% compared to the same quarter last year and up 5% compared to last quarter. The fluctuations were mainly due to changes in average LIBOR rates. The effect of income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 47.5% compared to 39.4% for the same quarter last year and 34.4% last quarter. These tax rates have been adjusted for the tax matter we discussed last quarter. Management is currently working with advisors to develop alternatives for reducing the future impact to our tax rate. On a go-forward basis for 2009, we estimate our effective tax rate to remain consistent at the mid 40% range. Please note that beginning last quarter, all prior period earnings per share amounts reported have been adjusted to reflect per the end tax adjustment. Fourth quarter fully diluted earnings per share of $0.23 was at the higher end of guidance. This was $0.02 lower than last fourth quarter’s earnings per share of $0.25 and $0.05 lower than last quarter’s earnings per share of $0.28. The year-over-year decline was mostly due to lower results in the permanent placement segment while the sequential decrease was due mainly to the higher effective tax rate. Fully diluted earnings per share of $1.2 was negatively impacted by $0.03 due to charges taken in the third quarter for the pharmacy business restructuring along with $0.02 of charges for sales reserve adjustments in our permanent placement division during both the third and fourth quarters. Pro forma 2008 earnings per share without these charges was $1.6 which was 3% above 2007 full year GAAP earnings per share of $1.4. Fully diluted shares outstanding during the fourth quarter were 32.9 million, down 4% from last year and 3% from last quarter, reflecting share repurchases during the year. We did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter and with access to credit markets tightening up, we are focusing on conserving cash and do not anticipate repurchasing any more shares in the short term. Our average fully diluted shares outstanding for the year were 33.8 million. The company generated $14 million of operating cash flow during the fourth quarter which when combined with $7 million of net cash on hand and $7 million of revolver draw downs during the quarter, were used primarily to pay estimated taxes and reduced debt. Full year operating cash was $16 million lower than last year primarily because of the higher cash tax payments. DSO at the end of the quarter was 57 days, down 2 days from last year and up a day from last quarter. The company continues to focus on its collection efforts to drive strong cash flow. We ended the quarter with $146 million of debt outstanding and a leverage ratio of 1.5 times adjusted EBITDA, a slight improvement compared to 1.6 times a year ago. The company’s debt agreement with lenders has a more stringent leverage ratio covenant that includes letters of credit and capital leases and requires a resulting leverage ratio to be below 2.5 times in the fourth quarter and below 2 times in 2009 and beyond. Our covenant ratio at the fourth quarter was 1.7 times, well within compliance. Our debt agreement also includes a covenant for fixed charge coverage or adjusted EBITDA divided by scheduled interest and principal payments that must exceed a ratio of 1.25. This ratio was 2 at year end, also well within compliance. Now, turning to our business segments, revenue in the nurse and allied segment was $207 million for the quarter, 5% growth year over year but down 5% sequentially. Travelers on assignment averaged 6865  this quarter, up 3% year over year, but down 4% from last quarter. Gross margin at 23.6% was down 80 basis points from last year, due mainly to the lower revenues from our higher margin international nursing division. Sequentially, gross margin remained steady as the loss of the international nursing margin was offset by favorable bill-pay spreads. The adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment was 6.9% for the quarter, down 50 basis points from last year, due primarily to higher insurance cost. Compared to prior quarter, adjusted EBITDA was up 60 basis points. Compared to prior quarter, adjusted EBITDA was up 60 basis points. Revenue in the locum tenens segment this quarter was $76 million, a slight increase over last year, but a 10% decrease from last quarter. The sequential decline was the result of a 9% decrease in days filled volume. Gross margin for the quarter was 26%, consistent with last year and down 60 basis points from last quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.9% was up 230 basis points from last year and steadied sequentially with both comparisons affected by a favorable actuarial insurance adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter. Revenue for the physician permanent placement segment was $12.2 million, down 7% from last year and 3% from last quarter. This year’s fourth quarter revenue was impacted by an unfavorable sales reserve adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter at 23.7% was down from last year and up from last quarter was driven by lower SG&A expenses. Management performed required impairment testing of goodwill and other long-lived assets effective December 31 in accordance with GAAP and concluded that there was no impairment. However, should the company have a sustained decrease in market value, this would be an indicator that goodwill should be reevaluated for impairment. If the charge were to be recognized, it would not impact compliance with our debt covenants as it would be a non-cash expense. With that, now let me return the call back to Susan. Susan Nowakowski As I hope you’ve learned from our comments today, we are very focused on building and sustaining for the long term while remaining balanced with the need to expand our leadership position today and adjust the company’s infrastructure ahead of the challenging market condition. We are confident that we are well positioned to navigate through this market environment. Like most industries, the current economic environment is making it more difficult to forecast our annual financial performance and provide meaningful guidance. Therefore, we will continue to share general business trends, but we will no longer provide specific quarterly or full year financial guidance. During the first quarter, order levels have slowed from most our business lines, most significantly with nurse and allied. This has resulted in travel nurse volumes declining by double-digit percentages both sequentially and year over year. In locum tenens, aggregate volumes are trending fairly consistently with prior year and prior quarter levels. Pricing is stable across most of our business lines, helping to maintain gross margins. On a consolidated basis, we are anticipating first quarter revenues to decline in the low to mid-teens on both a year over year and sequential basis, driven primarily by volume declines in nursing. The company expects to record a restructuring charge of approximately $3 million in the first quarter related to employee severance benefits and lease termination costs. Non-cash restructuring expenses are expected to total $400,000. We expect these restructuring actions to result in savings of approximately $10 million for 2009 and $15 million annually thereafter. As I said earlier, we have taken proactive steps to manage our business and strengthen our operating model through this economic downturn. There are three key aspects of our strategy that we continue to focus on. First, capturing more market share by leveraging our client base; second, proactively adjusting our cost structure and capturing additional productivity gains; and finally pursuing further penetration in emerging market opportunities and client segments. We are working very hard to ensure that we can flex our operating model in the short term while at the same time making the appropriate investments to be well positioned and innovative in the long term, and with that, we would now like to open up the call to your questions."
68,GV_144520_2009Q4,"Presentation Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Amy Chang. Please go ahead. Amy Chang Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to AMN Healthcare's Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Call. A replay of this webcast is available at amnhealthcare.com\investors and will be available until March 18, 2010. Details for the audio replay of the conference call can be found in our earnings press release. I would also like to mention our policy regarding forward-looking statements. As we conduct this call, various remarks that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, plan, will, may and other similar expressions. Any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. It is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and other quarterly and periodic reports, which have been filed with and are publicly available from the SEC. The results reported in this call may not be indicative of results for future quarters. These statements reflect the company's current belief and are based upon information currently available to it. Developments subsequent to this call may cause these statements to become outdated. The company does not intend, however, to update the guidance provided today prior to its next earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Susan Nowakowski, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thanks so much, Amy. On behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I'm pretty sure that most of us are happy to see 2009 behind us. Last year was without a doubt, the most challenging year in our industry and in our company's 25-year history. As stewards of the business for our shareholders, we are, of course, disappointed with the financial results for the year. However, we are proud of the aggressive and forward-looking actions taken by our team taken during such a turbulent time. These actions allowed us to preserve the financial health of our balance sheet, to maintain our profitability and industry-leading position, to improve our operating leverage for the future, to build stronger and deeper relationships with our clients and to continue to evolve our brand. The benefits of these actions were evidenced by the fact that during 2009, we reduced SG&A by $73 million or 32% less than 2008. We streamlined our infrastructure, giving us better leverage going forward if the market rebounds. Through building closer client relationships and delivering superior service, we increased the number of preferred provider client relationships threefold, and one of the nation's largest clinical VM staffing contract. We generated $99 million in cash flows and significantly paid down outstanding debt. We successfully renegotiated our credit facility, providing flexibility and capacity to invest in new opportunities. Amidst these significant actions, we also ensured appropriate resources were dedicated to delivering on our newer and important service offering. As we entered 2010, AMN Healthcare is in a much stronger position to deliver differentiated value to our clients. And this should be reflected in differentiated performance in the coming years. We are stronger as an organization, and are experiencing stabilization in our trends. But we are still faced with a relatively subdued market environment. For the first quarter of this year, we are expecting revenues to be sequentially flat, which does reverse a six-quarter trend of decline. Our current view is a modest but steady recovery throughout 2010. So now let's talk about what's been happening since our last call and the trends that we're seeing today. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $145 million, a decrease of 51% from prior year and 13% from prior quarter. This was in line with our expectations and the guidance that we gave. The primary driver of the year-over-year decline was the decrease in Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue, which was down 64% from the same quarter last year, and down 10% sequentially. On our last call, we indicated that we believe the Nurse and Allied industry would hit bottom during the fourth quarter, and that seems to have occurred. The sequential decline is due partially to seasonal trends, and because we were still in a fairly steep drop during the third quarter. Since October, we have seen stabilization in our Nurse traveler count volume trends, and have had consistent week-over-week increases since the first of the year. Demand for nurses have been higher on a year-over-year basis since November. However, the aggregate orders are still at relatively low levels. This could potentially prolong the recovery period and therefore, we would characterize our near-term outlook for the travel nurse industry as being positive, but cautious. Within this tight demand environment, we believe that we are very well-positioned to be a preferred partner with our clients. We spent considerable time in 2009 building stronger relationships with existing and new clients. This resulted in a meaningful increase in managed services and preferred provider contracts. In these closer relationships, our fill rates are nearly double the rate at multi-provider accounts. Throughout 2009, the sales team did an excellent job of educating clients on the necessity of maintaining rational pricing and competitive wages. Their efforts have resulted in steady bill rates, in spite of the challenging demand environment. Our Locum Tenens segment delivered fourth quarter revenues of $62 million, which is 18% lower than last year and 17% lower than last quarter. This year-over-year decline was driven primarily by two major factors. First, there was a greater than 40% volume decline in the Anesthesia division. And second, there was an over 20% drop in the Government business. Other contributors to the year-over-year decline were in primary care and radiology. About a third of the fourth quarter sequential decline was due to typical seasonal trends, and the remaining can be attributed to Anesthesia and Government, as well as some general softness across most of the specialties. There has been a delayed effect of the recession on the Locum Tenens Staffing business with volumes dropping about 10% from the first half of 2009 to the second half. It does appear, however, that after this drop, Locums is experiencing a quicker stabilization. For example, our projection today is that the first quarter days filled volume will be roughly flat to the fourth quarter. We've previously discussed the decline in the anesthesia market, which began in the third quarter of last year. The contraction was widespread throughout the industry, as anesthesia groups and contract management companies had fewer expansions and facilities performed fewer elective surgeries. These trends appear to have stabilized. Both anesthesia and surgery days sold have been relatively constant over the past few months. However, our near-term outlook for these two specialties does remain cautious, as hospital systems have reported little improvement in surgery volumes. We built an industry-leading Anesthesia Locums business over the past decade. And before the declines began, this division comprised about 22% of our Locums business. Today, it is 15%. Even with the lower demand, pricing across the physician specialties remained stable, with the exception of anesthesia, which encountered pressure from the drop in demand. We expect these same stable pricing trends to continue into 2010. We've made great progress over the years and, in particular last year, to integrate and improve efficiency in our operational support functions. This is evidenced last year by our ability to reduce costs and infrastructure in a rapidly changing environment. We do, however, have more opportunity to gain efficiency within the Locums operations. In late 2009, we launched a very focused and disciplined effort to assess and redesign our processes to be more effectively serving our clients, and to create a more flexible and scalable infrastructure, which will further reduce costs in the future. We are halfway into the project and have already identified a lot of low- hanging fruit and many bigger opportunities that we will be executing throughout the year. These efforts will have positive benefits for us in 2010, but even more importantly will provide sustainable cost savings and productivity improvement into the future. A bright spot in the Locum Tenens division was the fourth quarter volume increase experienced in our new market expansion into emergency medicine. Although days filled volume is still relatively small compared to our other specialties, this expanded service will enable us to serve our clients across a broader spectrum of their revenue-generating services. Insufficient Permanent Placement fourth quarter revenues were $8 million, which is 32% below prior year and 5% below prior quarter. The year-over-year variance is consistent with the third quarter, reflecting stabilization in the retained search market. The sequential revenue decline is in line with typical seasonal slowdown and the impact of more deferred revenue, due to the higher volume of new searches in the third quarter. New searches in the fourth quarter were down sequentially, primarily due to the holiday season, but we're still at levels above the first half of the year. While searches are looking stronger, placements for the fourth quarter were still below expectations. This is a reflection of the economic environment, the weak housing market, and the resulting hesitancy of physicians to pack up and move to a new city and a new job. We believe we can drive stronger recruitment and placement by reincreasing our recruiter headcount. We began this effort in January. And it will take about six months to make a meaningful impact on our placement rates. We continue to focus on creating new types of client relationships in the Perm Placement business. This month, we were selected to be the sole-retained physicians' search provider for one of the nation's largest associations of community health centers. They represent 4,500 members and 6,000 health clinics. This is a great example of the positive outcomes from our team's effort to take a more strategic sales approach with our clients, and develop additional preferred relationships. Because clinical labor is such a large component of every healthcare organization, proactive and strategic workforce management will always be a critical factor to their success. As we listened to our clients, it is clear that they will have an increased focus on physician recruitment in 2010. In the near term, however, many organizations anticipate continuing to rely on their in-house ability to hire physicians and clinicians. As the economy improves, healthcare professionals will return to their previous patterns of job movement and go back into retirement. In-house hospital recruiting resources will unlikely be able to keep up with the dual trends of increased hiring needs, compounded by higher attrition. At the same time, healthcare organizations will experience continued pressure to improve productivity without sacrificing the quality of patient care, which will draw additional interest to innovative solutions around the acquisition, retention and management of their workforce. Not only will our Core businesses be helpful, but our innovative service offerings, such as Managed Services and RPO, will help hospitals to achieve their efficiency and effectiveness goal. We launched our Recruitment Process Outsourcing business about a year ago. And although it is still a very small business, we've made good progress. Our RPO and Managed Services offerings can help facilities to shorten recruitment cycle times and fill workforce gaps more quickly, minimizing revenue loss and disruption to patient care. In 2010, AMN Healthcare is celebrating our 25th year in business. We are very proud of our past and our rise to the industry-leading position. However, the reality is that AMN is a very different company today than it was just five years ago. There are the externally obvious differences, such as the fact that we're more diversified. Five years ago, we had primarily one service offering, travel nursing. Today, we are able to offer our clients a much broader spectrum of staffing and recruitment services across multiple provider disciplines and specialties. To this point, half of our operating income is now coming from our Physician businesses, and our overall exposure to market fluctuations is certainly more balanced. We have made many internal changes over the past five years as well that make us a more sophisticated and agile company. This is reflected in our proven ability to launch new businesses and more proactively and quickly make organizational changes in-line with market trends. This capability is a product of our stronger and more diverse team, who is working in a more unified and collaborative way to reach our goals. Ours is a people business. And having stronger leaders, sales representatives and operations allows us to not only execute well, but also to be more agile and make changes and investments that will evolve the business. Our team sets the highest standards in the industry. And I am quite confident in our ability to continue to expand our leadership position and to develop innovative solutions for our clients. Now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Bary Bailey, our CFO, who will give you more detail on the fourth quarter results and our financial position. Bary? Bary G. Bailey Former Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Susan has provided you with a recap of 2009 and an overview of the top-line performance for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter revenue was in line with the revenue guidance we provided in last quarter's earnings call. Susan already mentioned that consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $145 million, which was 51% lower than the same period in the prior year and 13% lower than prior quarter. For the full year, revenues declined 38% from 2008, with the decline coming primarily from our Nurse and Allied segment, which was down 49%. Despite the dramatic reduction in demand, overall gross margin improved 90 basis points to 26.9% for the full year 2009 from 26% in 2008. Our positive gross margin trend continued in the fourth quarter of 2009, with a consolidated gross margin of 28.4% versus 25.7% in the prior year and 27.4% last quarter. As a side note, I think most of the companies in our sector have experienced perhaps their highest margins they have seen, which seems counter to traditional supply and demand theories. Similar to others, our overall margin in the fourth quarter is the highest margin in our history as a public company. Rational pricing discipline in the market has persisted, and this is rooted by the underlying shortage of healthcare professionals that inherently exists. While demand for nurses and healthcare overall has not abated, it is being met by those professionals taking permanent roles, working more shifts and staying close to home. Even with this environment, demand for nurses with specific skills and situations where the facilities have captured all they can of the nurses willing to take a permanent position, but still have openings, in their own way create a market that is constrained by supply. As we see the market come back, albeit slowly, our collective desire to fill demand will more likely result in increasing compensation and benefits to travelers to have them take such positions rather than decreasing bill rates to increase the apparent demand. The end result will be a slight margin compression. Looking again at our own trends. Overall, the increase in margin from last year and last quarter is due to continued gross margin improvement in our Nurse and Allied segment, partially offset by slightly lower fourth quarter gross margin in our Locum Tenens segment. Overall, margins were also benefited by our higher margin Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement segments, representing a greater portion of our business mix. Our Nurse and Allied segment benefited in the fourth quarter by improved bill-to-pay spread and lower traveler benefit costs. As we look forward to 2010, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to see an increasing compensation required to recruit healthcare professionals, which will have a moderate negative impact to our overall gross margin. We will start to see this in the first quarter of 2010 and expect margins to dip to the mid-27% range with some nominal improvement as we progress through the year. As we are all aware, the company took significant steps to rightsize the organization and improve the overall operating structure of the company in order to achieve sustained efficiencies. Fourth quarter SG&A expenses of $32 million reflect the impact of those changes, and were 41% lower than prior year and 12% lower than prior quarter. The fourth quarter includes a benefit of $1.8 million from positive development in our professional liability exposures. We obtained actuarial reports on our professional liability twice each year. As you may recall, we recorded a similar adjustment in the second quarter of this year, but are not anticipating adjustments of this magnitude in the future. Looking forward, we anticipate overall SG&A to be slightly lower in 2010 as compared to 2009. Our Nurse and Allied segment operating income for the fourth quarter was $7.7 million, representing a 61% decline as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in operating income in this segment is slightly lower than the revenue decline we saw, due in large part to cost of revenue decreasing at a faster pace. This was primarily due to lower labor costs. Nurse and Allied gross margin in the fourth quarter was 27%, 340 basis points higher than the same period in 2008, 260 basis points higher than last quarter. Traveler volume declined 10% as compared to the third quarter to 2,396. Nurse and Allied segment SG&A was lower reflecting the efforts taken to reduce ongoing operational costs and favorable professional liability experience. The ability to further reduce such costs is limited by a number of them being semi-variable or fixed in nature. However, as the business rebounds, we should reap the benefits of these cost reductions, most of which will not increase at the same pace as revenues. Overall, Nurse and Allied segment operating income margins increased to 10.4% from 9.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating income for our Locum Tenens segment for the fourth quarter decreased by 6% to $6.5 million from prior year, despite revenues declining 18%. Operating margin increased to 10.3%, which was up 130 basis points compared to last year, and 30 basis points compared to the previous quarter. The increases compared to prior year and prior quarter was due in part to the benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of $1.3 million associated with the continued improvement in our professional liability exposures. Excluding this benefit, our Locum segment operating margin actually declined by 100 basis points compared to prior year and 200 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The decreased operating margin was primarily due to specialty mix and labor cost within the SG&A that, while lower than the prior year and prior quarter by 24% and 9% respectively, are at levels that properly position us to grow in the future. Physician Permanent Placement operating income for the fourth quarter was $1.9 million, which declined 45% as compared to the same quarter last year, consistent with the decline in revenues for the same period. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 60%, which was up 130 basis points compared to last year, and 230 basis points compared to the previous quarter. In the third quarter, we began segregating costs that are not directly associated with the individual business units and reflecting them as unallocated corporate overhead. On a full year basis, unallocated overhead decreased 36% compared to the prior year, as a result of the steps taken by management in response to the market downturn. You will recall that the company recognized the benefit from the settlement of a liability arising from the MHA acquisition that had the effect of reducing unallocated overhead in the third quarter by $1.5 million. Adjusting for this item, unallocated overhead in the fourth quarter was consistent with the third quarter. We expect the savings to be largely sustained as we look forward to 2010. As indicated in our earnings release, the fourth quarter tax provision reflects the true up of state taxes, based on actual performance by state for the full year. The true up resulted in a reduction of our effective income tax rate from 28% reported in the third quarter to 26%. The resulting full year 2009 income tax benefit of $43 million compares to an income tax expense of $27 million for the prior year, where we reported an effective tax rate of 44%. The year-over-year change in the effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to the goodwill impairment charges recorded during 2009, a portion of which were permanently non-deductible for tax purposes. Excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment and restructuring charges, the 2009 effective tax rate would have been 59%, which was higher than the rate in 2008, due to the impact of the relationship of unrecognized tax benefits to pretax income. We expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to be consistent with this adjusted 2009 tax rate of 59%, while we expect our cash taxes to be more in line with our statutory rate of about 39%. For the fourth quarter, the company is reporting a net loss of $2.7 million or $0.08 per share. Excluding refinancing-related charges, the company's net loss, on an adjusted basis, was $0.02 per diluted share. The company successfully pursued collections, and reduced our net accounts receivable balances from December 2008 by over 50%. At the same time, we increased our reserves and allowances by 18%, reflecting the impact of market conditions to some of our clients, and in some cases, organizations providing Vendor Management Services. For the full year, we generated $99 million of operating cash flow, which was used primarily to pay down debt. Days sales outstanding of 57 days are the same as prior year. We have closely managed capital expenditures during the year, without limiting important investments to position the company. This last year, capital expenditures ran just under $4 million. We expect capital expenditures in 2010 to be about the same. In December of 2009, the company entered into a new credit agreement, which was used to pay off our existing term debt of $77 million and cash collateralize existing letters of credit. The new credit agreement includes a $40 million revolver and a $45 million accordion feature maturing in December of 2012, and $110 million term loan maturing in December 2013. As of December 31, 2009, total term debt outstanding, net of discounts, was $106 million, with no borrowings under the revolver. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio at year end was 1.9x, and this does not take into account that we could very well utilize capacity in our revolver as we did in the past to cover the letters of credit we cash collateralized. Instead, we have opted to preserve more capacity in our revolver for strategic opportunities. We do not see any, given our new facilities and the debt market, to hedge our interest rate. I will now return the call back to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thanks, Bary. We've already talked a bit about the current trends we're seeing, and so I'll try not to repeat all of them. The biggest highlight coming into the first quarter, is that our nurse travel account is showing increases week over week and month over month. Demand is above last year, but is still at relatively- subdued levels. While there is modest growth across the country, we believe that during 2010, we will benefit more from the strong preferred client and managed services relationships that we secured during 2009. This is best reflected in the expected 5% to 10% sequential increase in our travel nurse count in the first quarter. In Locum Tenens, demand and resulting volumes seems to be stabilizing after being hit in the second half of the year. Volumes are expected to remain sequentially flat for this segment in the first quarter. Revenues may be slightly down, due to a shift in specialty mix. Our more leading indicator of the future is days sold, and this has been trending up slightly during the past few months. In Physician Permanent Placement, active searches are expected to be sufficiently flat during the first quarter, but placements appear to be lagging and are expected to be slightly down. Based on these trends, first quarter consolidated revenue is expected to be flat with the prior quarter. Although we feel we have reached bottom and overall trends are stabilizing, leading indicators are showing mixed improvement, and therefore, we remain cautious in the near term. A question frequently asked is what will the trajectory of growth be for the healthcare staffing industry and for AMN? While there is no crystal ball to give us precise answers to future events, we certainly do study past dynamics of our industry and the projected future demographic drivers. We believe we have an educated view that guides us in our own long-term strategic planning and the investments we make in our business, and we're happy to share those thoughts with you. If we look out three to five years from now, the demographics that drive growth in our business look quite strong. By 2015, the number of individuals in the U.S. over the age of 65 and requiring more healthcare services will have increased by 14%. This alone will place incremental burdens on the clinical labor supply that cannot be simply absorbed. In addition, since the nation is at full capacity in residency programs and nursing schools, the new supply of clinicians is relatively capped, and will not replace the huge contingent of clinicians that are set to retire during the next five years. 40% of nurses are already over the age of 50, and that's nearly 50% for physicians. This will only get worse along with the general aging population. The most recent studies suggest that the gap between demand and supply of nurses and physicians will increase twofold by 2016, just due to the aging population alone. If there were to be any healthcare reform initiatives that increased access to care or brought additional reimbursement dollars into healthcare, we would likely see this shortage occur faster and more intensely. Being largely data-driven, this is all probably pretty easy to accept and plan towards. The bigger question is, what will the trajectory of demand and supply be over the next five years? Will it be the proverbial hockey stick, similar to what we experienced in the late 1990s? Or will it be the modest and steady growth we experienced after the last downturn in the early 2000? The primary two factors that we believe will determine the outcome will be the recovery of the U.S. economy and healthcare reform. The U.S. economy being by far, the most important. It appears that the economy is improving, but at a snail's pace. This sluggish recovery, including slow and small incremental improvements in unemployment rates, and improving but still volatile stock market, and a continuing weak housing market, will likely result in a near-term modest and steady recovery in the demand for our core services of staffing and placement. At some point, however, after our market has seen steady modest improvements, we will likely see a tipping point, where multiple factors have improved enough and the powerful demographic forces take hold and create a significantly-higher need for our services. Based on my 20 years in the industry and our team's tenure and expertise, we believe this will happen in the next five years and could be as early as the next two to three years. So during this period of steady and modest growth over the next couple of years, there are three key components that guide us in our strategic plan: First, to continue building stronger client relationships and gain market share without sacrificing price or margins. We can do this by showing our clients that we deliver differentiated value everyday. Two, to continue to nurture our newer business lines such as RPO, that move us from a purely transactional staffing provider to being a managed services expert and partner for our clients. We have had solid success in this over the past year. And three, to take our relationship with the healthcare community to a higher, more strategic level, by providing them with more innovative solutions to help manage their patient care quality, efficiency and the cost to provide such care. In this way, we become a more long-term strategic partner with our clients, and create a more sustainable recurring revenue stream. We've identified several areas of opportunity to accomplish this, and are in the midst to pursuing those through internal development and acquisitions. And with that, we would now like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan Salka, AMN Healthcare's President and Chief Executive Officer. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Amy. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s 2010 fourth quarter earnings conference call. I’m sure like everyone on this call the AMN team is keenly focused on the current and future opportunities in our business. But as much as we would like to jump right into the New Year with you, it is important to first reflect back on 2010 as our actions and performance last year have a lot to do with why we are starting 2011 in such a stronger position. After weathering through 2009 and the most severe contraction in the history of healthcare staffing, 2010 represented a year of stabilization and transition back to growth. During such turbulent times, companies can choose to either take a hunker down approach or use the opportunity to consolidate and make important strides in their long-term strategies. Just as we have done in prior contractions, we chose the latter approach to position AMN to build for the future. There were two key events that occurred for the company during 2010. First, the market began to stabilize and improve. Overall, for AMN, we bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2009 and stabilized going into the first quarter of last year. Then we experienced modest sequential growth in Q2, Q3 and now Q4. The travel nurse business experienced the strongest sequential growth during 2010. And the other staffing division stabilized and have also begun to show positive indicators. The second key event was our acquisition of Medfinders, which closed last September. This transaction not only delivered some immediate tangible benefits, but it also has a significant impact on our ability to deliver more sophisticated workforce solutions. These address the changing needs and buying behaviors of healthcare organizations. In our call today, I will be giving an update on our top three priorities. The first is the integration of the Medfinders acquisition to achieve the targeted EBITDA synergies. The second is to grow market share through the expansion of our managed services programs and cross-selling of our services. And third and probably always at the top of our list is the everyday execution in our core businesses to ensure solid performance and to deliver on our promises to our clients. The integration of the Medfinders organization is progressing very well. As we reported in our last call, the integration of the overlapping travel nursing businesses was completed in November. Since then, we have also completed the integration of certain corporate functions including marketing, HR, IT, risk management, and legal. The finance function will complete its integration by the end of March. We will also complete the full integration of the Medfinders allied brands onto our platform in April. And then finally, we are continuing to streamline clients and clinical operational functions into our shared services model. With this steady effort from our team, we are on track to achieve the targeted 8 million in annualized EBITDA cost synergies by the fourth quarter. The second key focus for the team has been to increase the direct fill rates in our existing managed services programs through the sharing of our expanded local and national candidate supply, whereas AMN previously used sub-contractors to fill our local per diem orders. We are now able to partially fill that demand directly through our own newly acquired Nursefinders’ local office network. Likewise, the travel nurse orders brought over by the Medfinders MSP contracts are now being primarily filled directly by leveraging AMN’s large pool of travel professionals. Just as an example to this in the top four MSP contracts that were brought in by the Medfinders acquisition, we have already increased our Travelers on Assignment directly filled by AMN by nearly 200. Based on the success we are running ahead of our original projection to add $2 million of additional annualized EBITDA by the fourth quarter of 2011. The improvement in direct fill rates is one example of the near-term benefits we are experiencing from our MSP offering. Another is the positive recognition from existing and new clients of the additional value and differentiation created from the combined companies. Since announcing the acquisition, we have been awarded 20 new MSP contracts of varying sizes, specialties and settings. These have an estimated annual growth spend under management of over 45 million. At the same clients, our pre-MSP revenue was running at about 7 million per year. So, the majority of the 45 is upside opportunity for the company. All of what I have just mentioned is being accomplished on top of our third area of attention, which is our everyday execution and client focus. Our efforts to integrate the two companies to achieve the expected synergies are certainly critical. However, it is equally important that we continue to have solid execution in our core businesses in order to meet or exceed our client’s needs and expectations. Here are some of the highlights in market trends and each of the business segments. Overall consolidated revenues for the fourth quarter were 220 million. Organic same-store consolidated revenues were up 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. This represents the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in consolidated revenues and the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in our largest business segment of nurse and allied staffing. This is also the first quarter of year-over-year consolidated growth experienced in two years. Fourth quarter nurse and allied revenues were 127 million, up 37% sequentially and 72% year-over-year. This includes 24 million in revenues associated with the local per diem business from the Medfinders acquisition. On an organic same-store basis, the nurse and allied business generated growth of 9% compared to the prior quarter and 17% compared with the prior year. The growth was driven by volume increases at both MSP and traditional clients with pricing remaining stable. Travel nurse order levels continued to increase throughout 2010 and going into the first quarter both sequentially and year-over-year. Demand is rising at both MSP clients as well as at our traditional clients. And the overall number of facilities with travel nurse orders continues to move upward both sequentially and year-over-year. The growth in orders is also occurring in multiple geographies. With our top five states spanning the West, Northeast, the Southeast and the South, our MSP orders have been trending at approximately 20 to 25% of our overall travel nursing demand. Fourth quarter performance in the local per diem business on a pro forma basis was up 14% sequentially due largely to seasonal demand from flu clinics. The local per diem business tends to fluctuate more due to the short-term nature of the business. Fourth quarter allied revenue was up slightly on an organic same-store basis. However, this was tampered by some disruption from the allied integration. As we mentioned earlier, the allied business is undergoing the greatest amount of integration activities and the team there is doing an excellent job working through the transition. Our locum tenens segment delivered fourth quarter revenues of 69 million, which included 7 million from the Medfinders locums business. As anticipated, the locums business declined on a organic same- store basis by 8% compared with the prior quarter. This was due primarily to lower volumes from typical seasonality. The business was flat on a year-over-year organic same-store basis. However, the forward- looking trends in the business appear to be improving. Overall days sold in the fourth quarter were up sequentially and year-over-year with the largest increase experienced in primary care. For the first quarter, we are expecting locums revenues to be up slightly on a sequential basis. Across competitors, short-term trends continued to be mixed. However, there is pretty consistent agreement that the long-term demand and supply dynamics of the physician staffing business continue to be strong. In Physician Permanent Placement, fourth quarter revenues were 9.3 million, which on an organic same- store basis represented a decrease of 1% over the prior quarter and a 3% increase year-over-year. A fourth quarter seasonal decline is typical for this business, but we do believe our new search activity was weaker than it should have been due to having two few marketers to cover sales territories. The marketing team that we do have in place is extremely strong and they were able to achieve high productivity levels. We just need more train marketers in the field meeting with current and potential clients. So therefore, we are aggressively hiring and training new marketers. In the fourth quarter, the company added 14 million in revenues from Home Healthcare Services. This represented a 1% sequential decline on a pro forma basis, which was in line with the industry. The decline was driven primarily by a decrease in Medicaid revenues. Medicaid represents 37% of the division’s revenue in the fourth quarter. And we are expecting the segment revenues to be down slightly again in the first quarter with continued Medicaid pressures. Well, much of what we are speaking of today is about what will affect our business in the next few quarters. We are also very focused on evolving our service volumes to meet the changing needs of our clients over the next several years. Healthcare organizations are beginning to transform their delivery models to address the challenge of providing increased access to health services while maintaining quality and reducing costs. As a part of this, they are gravitating to strong partners who can offer more sophisticated solutions that can deliver value and efficiencies. This can come in a variety of forms such as managing their total supplemental staffing in a more streamlined way, reducing their overall labor spend, and improving their cost and quality of new clinician talent. This can also include working more efficiently with Home Healthcare Services to provide transitionary care and management that reduces unnecessary and unprofitable readmissions. Through our combination, we believe we have been able to make strides in our long-term strategy to ensure we are evolving alongside our clients. Our ability to use 2010 as a building block and our solid start in 2011 is a direct reflection of our committed and talented team. The team has done a tremendous job and our efforts to grow market share and emerge from the downturn ahead of the pack. Their efforts and the strong values that they exhibit were also the key ingredient to a smooth integration of the two companies. It is through our values driven culture and our relentless focus on our clients that enabled AMN Healthcare to evolve into the largest provider of healthcare staffing and workforce solutions. Our third important ingredient to our ability to evolve is our financial discipline. This is a perfect segue to introduce Brian Scott. Any investor, banker, or analyst who has interacted with AMN over the past few years probably already knows Brian. He was our Senior Vice President of Finance and Business Development and he knows our business extremely well. During his seven years with AMN, Brian oversaw the company’s corporate financial planning, capital funding, business development, and SEC reporting activities. He also severed as the President of AMN’s Pharmacy Staffing Division for sometime. He took the reigns as our Chief Financial Officer in January and he is ideally suited for this role. So Brian, it is my pleasure for the first time to turn this earnings call over to you. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon everyone. As Susan mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was 220 million. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.1% slightly down from last year, but up 70 basis points from last quarter. The 30 basis point decline from the prior year came from compression in the pay-to- bill spread in our locum tenens business and higher housing cost in our nurse and allied segment partially offset by the addition of the higher margin Medfinders business. The addition of Medfinders for our full quarter was the primary driver of the sequential margin improvement. SG&A in the quarter totaled 54.8 million, which included 2 million of cost associated with the integration of Medfinders and a $1.2 million bad debt charge related to our client in our locum tenens segment. Excluding these charges and the 6.3 million of transaction and integration related expenses incurred in the third quarter, SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased sequentially by 40 basis points to 23.4%. The majority of the increased SG&A margin is a result of including Medfinders for a full quarter, as Medfinders has a somewhat higher SG&A margin to support the local staffing infrastructure. In addition, we have added some headcount to support the continued growth in MSP accounts. Overall, we did not anticipate significant cost synergies in this quarter, but as Susan mentioned, our integration efforts are well underway and we are on track to achieve our expected 8 million of annualized SG&A savings for the fourth quarter of 2011. Much of these savings will take hold during the next two quarters. Our nurse and allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 37% with Medfinders adding approximately 41 million in revenue to the quarter. Nurse and allied gross margin increased by 40 basis points to 26.1% through the inclusion of a full quarter of the higher gross margin Medfinders local and allied businesses partially offset by the higher traveler housing costs in the quarter. Fourth quarter nurse and allied segment operating income was 10.7 million or 8.4% of revenue as compared to 8.6 million or 9.2% of revenue in the prior quarter with the higher operating cost for Medfinders driving the decline in the operating margin. Our locum tenens segment revenue was essentially flat with the prior quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisition, revenue decreased 8% reflecting a 9% decrease in days filled offset by a small increase in our pricing. The gross margin of 25.4% was bolstered by the addition of Medfinders locums business. The organic locums business experienced continued pressure on the pay bill spread in certain specialties. Locums operating income of 4.8 million or 6.9% of related revenues compares to 5.4 million or 7.7% in the prior quarter. This decline is the result of the $1.2 million bad debt charge in the fourth quarter that I mentioned earlier. Within our Physician Permanent Placement segment, revenue grew sequentially by 7% due to the addition of the Medfinders physician firm business. Physician Permanent Placement operating income for the fourth quarter was 2.3 million or 24.8% of revenue. Our new home healthcare segment generated [ph] revenue of 14.3 million and operating income of 1.1 million for the quarter. Gross margin on this business was 37% for the quarter consistent with the prior quarter. Unallocated overhead, excluding stock compensation in the fourth quarter was 9.8 million, down from 12.6 million in the preceding quarter and higher than the prior year expense of 5.4 million. The fourth quarter includes about 2 million in costs associated with the Medfinders integration including severance, lease termination fees, legal and other similar costs. The prior quarter included about 6.3 million of such costs as well as transaction related expenses. Excluding these items, the remaining increase in unallocated overhead was due mainly to having a full quarter of Medfinders corporate costs. During the fourth quarter, we finalized the goodwill and intangibles impairment assessment that was initiated in the previous quarter and recorded the charge of 1.1 million. We also performed our normal annual goodwill and intangible impairment analysis in the fourth quarter, which included the Medfinders values and determine that there was no impairment. On a GAAP basis, we reported a fourth quarter pre-tax loss of 4.5 million. The fourth quarter tax rate reflects the true up of the full year tax rate to 17%, which was impacted by certain permanent differences including non-deductible portions of the transaction costs and goodwill impairment charges incurred during the year. Excluding the goodwill impairment charges and the acquisition-related costs, our effective tax rate on a full year basis was 64%. This raised difference in the statutory rate in large part due to permanent differences having a disproportionate impact as a result of our relatively low 2010 pre-tax income. For the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.03. Adding back integration charges and impairment charges incurred in the quarter, our adjusted loss per share was $0.01. Fourth quarter operating cash flow was $4.8 million. The full year operating cash flow of 8.1 million was net of an 11.5 million of acquisition and financing related cash costs that were not capitalized as part of the transaction. Day sales outstanding were 53 days as compared to 54 last quarter. We do anticipate that DSO may increase back into the mid 50s range. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were 1.8 million. As of December 31st, our cash equivalents totaled 2 million and our total term debt outstanding was 215 million, with no borrowings under our $40 million revolver. Our plan is to use the majority of our cash flows to pay down debt and our goal is to reduce our debt to EBITDA ratio by half within the next two years. Going into the first quarter of 2011, the nursing and allied staffing segments continue experience positive momentum. This growth particularly in the travel nurse business is being driven by continued penetration of existing and new MSP accounts and a steady improvement in traditional client demand. Fourth quarter local per diem revenue is expected to experience a sequential single-digit decline due to the fourth quarter having higher seasonal revenues from the flu clinic business. Allied staffing revenue is expected to be down sequentially due mainly to the anticipated disruption from the integration activities. The locum tenens division is showing signs of modest improvement in demand, which is expected to translate into a slight sequential increase in revenue. Physician Permanent Placement revenue is expected to be relatively flat. Our Home Healthcare division is expected to be declined slightly as the historical reliance on Medicaid business is being impacted by states budgetary challenges and while we transition our business to a higher mix of Private Pay and Medicare. On a consolidated basis, first quarter revenues are expected to be between 223 million and 227 million with gross margin anticipated to remain steady with the prior quarter. Excluding integration related costs, SG&A dollars are expected to remain roughly flat in the next quarter. I’d like to provide some other financial estimates for 2011. We anticipate 2011 depreciation expense of approximately 10 million then amortization expense of approximately 7.5 million. Interest expense for the full year is expected to be around 22 million, which includes 3 million of amortized deferred financing cost and original issue discount. Our tax rate should be in the mid 50s with a cash tax rate closer to 20% taking into account the utilization of tax benefits, primarily from the Medfinders acquisition. Share count should be in the 46 million range. Finally, capital expenditures should be between 6 million and 8 million, which is higher than the prior year due in large part to the addition of Medfinders and several projects supporting the integration. And with that, we’d like to open the call for questions. As we’ve had over the past couple of calls, we also have with us Ralph Henderson, President of Travel Nurse and Allied Staffing and Bob Livonius, President of Workforce Solutions available to answer questions.

I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you so much, Amy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AMN Healthcare’s 2011 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. 2011 was a year of continued market recovery, solid execution, and further innovation in the Workforce Solutions that we provide to our clients. For the full year, we grew consolidated revenues by 11% and adjusted EBITDA by 40% on a pro forma basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year was 7.2%, which was a 150 basis point improvement over 2010. Our growth in operating leverage was driven by several key factors. First, the Travel Nurse division experienced full year pro forma revenue growth of 32% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 71%. This impressive growth reflects the strength of our MSP client relationships, our recruitment strategies, and the ability to leverage our infrastructure. Of course, none of this is possible without maintaining a very keen focus on the quality of our healthcare professionals that we source and select for our clients. A second factor was the revenue synergies we enjoyed from our combination with Medfinders, which enabled our team to significantly improve fill rates. Our more powerful integrated sales team led the industry in MSP growth, winning over 20 new MSP clients in 2011 with an estimated 80 million in annualized growth spend under management. A third factor was the successful integration of the Nurse and Allied brands into 1 platform. This contributed to the improvement in operating margins in this segment of 220 basis points on a pro forma basis. In addition to solid execution, we have further evolved our suite of Workforce Solutions to provide greater value to our healthcare clients. The pace of change has accelerated in healthcare. And hospital executives are increasingly seeking more sophisticated solutions and partners. The hunger for new and innovative solutions is stronger than we have ever seen. The rapid growth of MSP clients is the best example of this trend. We help these clients to gain more control, visibility, and consistency in the utilization of their clinical labor, while also improving quality and compliance. Penetration of MSP is strongest is Nurse Staffing, but has also been growing in the Allied Healthcare business over the past year. During the fourth quarter, approximately 1/3 of our Nurse and Allied revenues were generated by MSP clients. This is a significant increase since 2009 when MSP revenues represented only 6% of our Nurse and Allied revenues. Based on insights from clients, and what most believe to be a natural progression within the industry, we believe that there will be a similar shift towards MSP arrangements in the Locum Tenens market. All signs point to continued growth in MSP penetration. And as the most experienced provider in this phase, AMN is well positioned to capitalize on this trend. Over the past year, we have also made further advancements in our Workforce Solutions through the growth of our RPO business and other Workforce-related consulting services. In addition, we also continued to grow our EMR staffing business. These consultative Workforce Solutions doubled in size in 2011 and they differentiate us with our clients. Over the past 2 years, great progress has been made in shifting the perception of our services from what was once a necessary evil to being seen today as an effective way to manage workforce expenses. These higher margin businesses also help us to make progress towards our goal of returning to a 10% adjusted EBITDA margin in the next 3 to 5 years. Now let’s turn to our current results. We are pleased to report consolidated fourth quarter revenues of $222 million, which was down 3% sequentially and up 8% year-over-year. This was at the upper end of our guidance of $219 to $223. These results exclude our Home Healthcare segment, which were considered discontinued operations. Fourth quarter Nurse and Allied revenues were $148 million, which were flat sequentially and up 16% year-over-year. This growth was driven mainly by the Travel Nurse business where revenues were flat sequentially and up 26% year-over-year. While we hit our peak volumes for travel nursing in November, we typically see a softening over the holidays due to the fewer travelers on assignment and fewer hours being worked. For the first quarter of 2012, travel nurse volume is expected to be up over 5% sequentially and in the mid-teens over prior year. The continued growth has been driven by the addition of more MSP clients, increased supply of candidates, improved fill rates, and strong re-book rates. While volume is up in the fourth quarter, our current open orders are down slightly year-over-year, which we attribute to a weaker flu season and our improved fill rates. Over the past few weeks, we have seen an improvement in new orders and with the number of facilities that have orders open. The leverage and efficiency inherent in our MSP delivery model has also contributed to our improvement in margins for this business. As an example, the Travel Nurse division fourth quarter operating margin improved by 400 basis points year-over-year, at the same time we continued to grow our MSP client base. Fourth quarter Travel Nurse average bill rates were up 2% year-over-year. We expect this trend of modest bill rate improvement to continue throughout 2012. In fact, we are expecting the first quarter bill rate to move up closer to 3% year-over-year. However, we will pass along an appropriate amount of this increase as compensation so that we can ensure that we attract the best healthcare professionals for our clients. We also anticipate continued upward pressure on temporary housing costs. So you should not expect gross margin expansion from these bill rate increases. Fourth quarter revenues for local staffing were $24 million, which was up 1% sequentially and 2% year- over-year. Going into the first quarter, we expect revenues from local staffing to be down sequentially due to the seasonal flu clinic business that we experience in the fourth quarter and the lack of any meaningful flu driven census so far in 2012. Year-over-year revenue growth in local staffing may be stagnant for few quarters as we recently underwent a strategic rationalization of our geographic footprint and we eliminated 8 underperforming offices. These offices were primarily in rural areas and generally had low profitability and less future potential to serve or grow our MSP clients. Closing these offices will enable us to reallocate resources and better serve existing and future MSP clients in the larger metropolitan areas. As an example, we are in the process of opening a local office in New York City to serve a very large MSP client that we implemented in the fourth quarter, and to serve other clients in the area. Fourth quarter Allied revenue was $30 million, which was down 3% sequentially and up 2% year-over- year. This sequential decline was due to normal seasonality as clients operate at reduced service levels during the holidays. Going into the first quarter, we expect a modest sequential improvement driven by volume growth in our therapy business. Although there are certainly some head winds in reimbursement rates for skilled nursing clients, we continue to experience strong demand for therapist overall and we’re focused on growing our therapy supply. We have also experienced recent improvement in our margins, our fill rates, and our re- book rates. Today, approximately 2/3 of our allied business is in the therapy disciplines. And the remainder is in imaging, respiratory, and lab techs. In our Locum Tenens segment, fourth quarter revenues were $65 million, down 10% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Although most of this sequential decline was due to normal seasonality, there was also the continued market-driven impact of volume decreases in radiology, surgery, and anesthesia. Our government division, which supplies all specialties, also experienced greater softness due to funding delays and budget constraints. Going into the first quarter, overall Lcoums revenues are expected to be relatively flat. This week, Sean Ebner joined AMN as the new president of our Locum Tenens division. We are very excited to have Sean join the AMN family. He has a proven track record of success in the staffing industry. And his extensive sales leadership, operations, and business development experience make him ideally suited to lead our locum tenens business. Most recently, Sean led a very successful division, within Technisource, a subsidiary of Randstad. We look forward to the positive impact that Sean will have in growing our top line revenues and our profitability within Locums. Sean will report directly to Ralph Henderson, whose responsibilities were expanded to cover all of our Temporary Staffing businesses. This reporting structure will help to better capture the cross-selling opportunities that exist across our service lines. Over the years, Ralph has demonstrated a proven track record of industry leading revenue and profitability growth. And we are very pleased to expand his role to President of Healthcare Staffing. In Physician Permit Placements, fourth quarter revenues were $9 million, up 2% sequentially and flat year-over-year. The physician search market continues to be steady and may be revealing some signs of growth ahead. We are expecting first quarter searches to be up sequentially and year-over-year. We also continue to focus on maintaining marketer and recruitment bench strengths to insure we are able to achieve high fill rates on our active searches. We have been able to continue also monetize our thought leadership expertise through projects and surveys that leverage our extensive relationship and database of clinicians. A good example of this is a follow-on survey were we are engaged in a partnership with the Physician’s Foundation to complete one of the largest physician surveys ever conducted in the U.S. On January 30th, we completed the sale of our Home Healthcare business and we used the proceeds to pay down our debt. This divesture enables our leadership team to focus 100% of our attention on our Workforce Solutions, Staffing and Recruitment businesses. As hospital executives seek to transform their business models, they are more open than ever to implementing innovative solutions to manage their clinical workforce. Our leading position in workforce solutions has more clearly differentiated AMN and the added value that we bring to the clients. Beyond our success in the MSP space, another confirmation of our reputation as a leader in workforce innovation is our recent recognition as Supplier of the Year by Novation. They are the largest group purchasing organization in the country. This prestigious award was based on our high level of strategic partnership and compliance with their quality standards. This is an example of our differentiated approach to partnering with healthcare organizations. This type of national recognition and the positive results we are reporting today are made possible by our committed and highly engaged team members and the healthy culture that they create. As a true people business, we are proud to have the most talented, experienced, and passionate team in the industry. I would like to thank everyone for their unique contributions that enable us to serve our clients, our healthcare professionals, and our shareholders. What we are seeing today is the powerful combination of having a highly engaged and capable team coupled with the strategy that puts our client’s needs and goals at the forefront of everything we do. I will come back to you in our Q&A session along with Ralph and Bob to help answer your questions. But for now, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Brian Scott. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. As previously mentioned, with the recent sale of our Home Healthcare business, the operating results for this segment have been classified separately as discontinued operations for all periods reported. Fourth quarter revenue from continuing operations was $222.1 million, up 8% from last year and down 3% from last quarter. For the full year 2011, we reported revenue of $887.5 million, a 32% increase from 2010. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.3%, up 80 basis points from last year and up 50 basis points from the last quarter. The increase from both periods was from improved gross margins in the Nurse and Allied segment. Full year 2011 gross margin of 28.1% included favorable workers’ compensation adjustments and the realization of deferred revenue from the adoption of a new accounting standard in our Physician Permanent Placement segment. Excluding these items, gross margin improved from the prior year by 10 basis points. More importantly, end of the year at its highest point. SG&A in the quarter totaled $49 million, which included approximately $300,000 of cost associated with the integration of Medfinders. Excluding acquisition and integration expenses, SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 21.9% decreased from the prior year by 170 basis points, an increase of 40 basis points sequentially. The significantly improved leverage from the prior year resulted from achieving the targeted integration synergies from the acquisition. Also the impact from operations changes implemented over the last several years as well as the prior year having unusually high bad debt expense. Our Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased sequentially by 0.3% to $148.1 million. Volume grew 0.3% sequentially to 5,317 healthcare professionals. And revenue per day was essentially flat on slightly higher bill rates offset by the typical seasonal decline in hours worked. Nurse and Allied gross margin increased year-over-year by 130 basis points and sequentially by 80 basis point to 27.4%, due in part to improved bill pay spreads, more than offsetting an increase in housing costs. Fourth quarter Nurse and Allied operating income was $18.1 million or 12.2% of revenue. That’s compared to $15.2 million or 10.3% of revenue in the prior quarter. This is the highest operating margin for this segment since 2008. The sequential increase in operating margin was due to the higher gross margins along with lower fourth quarter professional liability costs. The third quarter also included about $600,000 of costs associated with closing our You Pay office. The operating margin improved by 380 basis points year-over-year due in large part to cost synergies from integrating the Medfinders Travel, Nurse and Allied businesses and improved operating leverage as well as the higher gross margin. For the full year 2011, Nurse and Allied revenue was $570.7 million, up 54% from the prior year. Segment operating income of $62.8 million or 11% of revenue compares to the prior income of $35.3 million or 9.5% of revenue. Our Locum Tenens segment revenue decreased 10% from the prior quarter reflecting a 7% decrease in day sales and a 3.5% decrease in revenue for day fills. Gross margin of 25.5% was up by 10 basis points from the prior year, but down sequentially by 50 basis points due in part to lower perm placement conversion revenue. Locums’ operating income of $3.9 million of 6.1% of revenues compares to $6.3 million or 8.7% in the prior quarter with a decrease related mainly to the lower revenue. For the full year, Locum Tenens segment revenue was $277.9 million with segment operating income of $21.7 million. This compares to prior year revenue of $264.7 million and operating income of $22 million. Within our Physician Permanent Placement segment, revenue increased sequentially by 2% due in part to an increase in placements made. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was relatively flat. The impact from adoption of a new recognition standard in 2011 is essentially complete with a benefit of less than $100,000 in the fourth quarter. Physician Permanent Placement operating income for the fourth quarter was $2.2 million or 23.1% of revenue. For the full year, Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $38.9 million. That’s compared to $34 million in the prior year with the increase impacted by the revenue recognition change. Segment operating income of $10.6 million compares to the prior year operating income of $8 million. On a GAAP basis, we reported fourth quarter pre-tax income of $4.4 million and full year pre-tax income of $13.9 million. This excludes the Home Healthcare operating results, and associated goodwill, and non- cash and tangible asset impairments of $7.7 million and $31.2 million for the quarter. Excluding the integration and credit agreement amendment costs, our adjusted full-year effective tax rate from continuing operations was 58%. However, due primarily to the continued utilization of certain tax benefits from the Medfinders acquisition, our net cash taxes paid in 2011 was less than $500,000. During the next 5 years, we still anticipate being able to utilize over $20 million of cash tax benefits from the Medfinders acquisition. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.04 for the fourth quarter and $0.11 for the full year 2011. Excluding the Medfinders integration expenses and credit facility amendment costs, adjusted earnings per share was $0.04 in the fourth quarter and was $0.16 for the year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $6.5 million. And for the full year was $19.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $1.1 million. And for the full year were $4.6 million. Day sales outstanding excluding the retained Home Healthcare accounts receivables were 57 days compared to 55 days in the last quarter and 53 days last year. The year-end increase was partly related to an anticipated temporary impact to consolidated Medfinders collections and to our shared services model. During 2012, we expect this transition to be both operationally more efficient and to ultimately reduce DSO. As Susan noted, on January 30, we completed the sale of our Home Healthcare business and received cash proceeds of $9.65 million and retained the majority of the working capital. As of December 31, our cash and equivalents totaled $4 million. And our total debt outstanding under our credit agreement net of discount was $205 million. Subsequent to year end, we made a $5 million voluntary payment on our long term debt and paid off the $3 million balance on our revolver. Now let’s turn to our guidance for the first quarter. Consolidated revenues are expected to be between $224 and $228 million, which represents a 1% to 3% sequential increase. This sequential increase is driven by continued growth in the Nurse and Allied staffing segments with flat revenues in the Locum Tenens segments. Gross margin is anticipated to be between 27.5% and 28%. SG&A expenses are expected to be approximately 22% of revenue. And adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 6.5%. I would also like to provide some other financial estimates for 2012. We anticipate full year 2012 depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $15.5 million. Interest expense for the full year is expected to be around $20.5 million, which includes $3.5 million on non-cash amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount. Based on current full year forecasts, our effective income tax rate should be approximately 50% with a cash tax rate closer to 25% taking into account the utilization of the previously-noted tax benefits. Share count should be in the $46 to $46.5 million range. And finally, capital expenditures are expected to be between $6 and $8 million, an increase from last year, but still below historic levels and less than 1% of revenue. This increase will be primarily targeted at several innovative investments in marketing, mobile, and social media technologies in order to drive to improved recruitment, conversion, and retention of healthcare professionals as well as back office enhancements to drive longer-term operational efficiency. And with that, we’d like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you, Amy. Good afternoon and welcome to AMN Healthcare's 2012 full year and fourth quarter earnings conference call. AMN Healthcare made tremendous strides in executing on our long term strategy during 2012. Throughout the year we experienced the synergies of market improvement, solid execution and further recognition of AMN as the leader and innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and staffing. Full year consolidated revenue grew by 7% and adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% as we continued to drive improved operating leverage. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the year was 7.7%, a 50 basis point improvement towards our longer term goal of 10%. This improvement in leverage was achieved in spite of the increased spending on our digital sourcing workforce solutions and technology initiatives. Our performance was driven primarily by our travel nurse business, which grew revenue by 22% and adjusted EBITDA by 25% over prior year. We had strong fourth quarter results as well with consolidated revenue of $248 million which exceeded our guidance range and was up 12% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. We also achieved adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.8% which was slightly better than anticipated. Our performance in 2012 was driven by growth in demand from both our traditional clients as well as our MSP clients. AMN is on track with our strategy to expand our leadership position as the nation’s innovator in healthcare workforce solutions. With clinical labor making up half of a hospital’s cost structure, healthcare providers are increasingly seeking sophisticated, innovative solutions to improve patient outcomes, cost management and access to talent. We continued our strong momentum in this area as we added over 20 new MSP clients with an estimated $85 million in annualized gross spend under management, which at maturity, should yield over $40 million in direct revenue for AMN. Our direct revenue through MSP clients increased this year by 37% to $253 million, representing 39% of our nurse and allied staffing business. In nurse MSP contracts, we typically achieve fill rates that are nearly double those in traditional contracts which enables us to grow faster during periods of expansion and provides some protection during downturns. We are also benefiting from growing MSP trends in the allied staffing and Locums businesses. MSP clients now make up 18% of our allied staffing revenue, compared to 13% just a year ago. We also signed our first Locum Tenens MSP clients in 2012. We expect to see continued MSP growth in nursing, Allied, and Locums and feel we are very well positioned in the industry to capitalize on these trends. For 2013, our MSP pipeline remains robust and we anticipate further penetration across all of our staffing businesses throughout the year. This year, we also made progress in our other workforce solutions, such as recruitment process outsourcing, electronic medical records implementation and workforce consulting. A recent study showed that 43% of healthcare organizations are rethinking and investing in their existing recruitment strategies to improve satisfaction and reduce time and cost to hire. While these service offerings are still small in revenue to AMN, they are a higher margin and they strengthen our position with our clients as a strategic partner. Now let’s review our results by business segment. Fourth quarter nurse and allied staffing revenue was up 18% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. The largest contributor was the travel nurse business where volume was up 25% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. The travel nurse demand growth was in both traditional and MSP clients and evenly distributed across geographies. Clients with orders, clients with clinicians on assignment and nurse applicant supply were also up year-over-year. In addition, due to client demand and very strong execution by our team, we’ve been experiencing a higher level of EMR engagements during the fourth quarter and continuing into 2013. Going into the first quarter, strong bookings have continued within the travel nurse business and we expect volume to be up approximately 20% year-over-year. There are 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter which will somewhat dampen the sequential revenue performance. Now, turning to local staffing. Fourth quarter revenue was down 9% compared to the prior year and 1% sequentially. The lower year-over-year revenue was due primarily to the office closures that took place in the fourth quarter of last year as well as some cancelations from Hurricane Sandy. Despite lower demand and supply constraints in certain markets, the business continued to stabilize, with working nurses, accounts with revenue and bill rates flat sequentially. The New York and Philadelphia offices that we opened in 2012 have continued to produce month-over-month revenue growth as they support MSP accounts. Based on these trends, first quarter of local staffing revenues are expected to be up slightly both year-over-year and sequentially. Fourth quarter allied staffing revenue was up 12% year-over-year, but down 2% sequentially, with the year-over-year growth occurring across most specialties. Recently, however, therapy orders have declined as a result of several reimbursement impacts. Beginning back in the fourth quarter, there were changes made to the therapy reimbursement caps which resulted in a lower demand for physical therapists. In April 2013, therapy providers are expected to experience further reductions for reimbursements that are tied to multiple procedures. As a precautionary measure, some therapy clients have reduced their use of travelers as they determine the impact of the reimbursement reductions. Therapy staffing currently makes up slightly more than half of our allied staffing revenue. Going into the first quarter, we anticipate allied staffing revenue will be up 2% year-over-year, but down sequentially, driven primarily by strong growth in imaging, respiratory and lab staffing, but offset by a decline in therapy staffing. Locum Tenens fourth quarter revenue was down 3% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. The sequential revenue decline was due to typical seasonality. The year-over-year revenue drop was driven mainly by declines in our radiology, government and surgery businesses. The radiology business has experienced significant market declines over the past 2 years and AMN was over-weighted relative to the industry in this area. Over time, we have shifted away from this specialty and today it represents only about 6% of our Locums revenues. Gross margins improved by 250 basis points year-over-year, due to our pricing and margin improvement initiative. Based on the demand trends and progress that the team is making towards this initiative, we expect first quarter Locums revenue to be up slightly year-over-year and sequentially. In physician permanent placement, fourth quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. The year- over-year improvement was driven mainly by higher placements and active searches in the fourth quarter. We are very pleased with the continued progress of this business segment and in the first quarter, we anticipate revenue will be up in the high single digits year-over-year and slightly down sequentially. We’re excited about the positive outlook for 2013 and future years. The longer term trends sealing demand for our services include the growing adoption of workforce solutions, the increased demand for healthcare from the aging population and the addition of 30 million insured citizens and the worsening clinical labor shortage as clinicians and physicians retire. To ensure we are well-positioned to maximize this future opportunity, we are making increased strategic investments today in 3 key areas: The first is what we call our digital transformation, which includes innovative recruitment technologies, job distribution platforms and mobile applications to aggressively attract more candidate supply. The second is in the continued differentiation and expansion of our suite of workforce solutions. And the third investment is to streamline our technology infrastructure for greater efficiency, scalability and agility. This higher level of SG&A spending is expected to be an important contributor to delivering industry-leading revenue growth and improved operating leverage in the future. Before I hand it over to Brian, I would like to take a moment to thank our very talented and experienced team members who have delivered the solid performance and results we are reporting today. Our team members are exceptionally passionate and committed to delivering excellence and value every day to our clients, clinicians and physicians. It’s this level of engagement and execution combined with our differentiated strategy that has set us apart in the marketplace and enables us to deliver greater shareholder value. I will come back to you in our Q&A section along with Ralph and Bob to help answer your questions. But for now I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon everyone. Our fourth quarter revenue was $247.8 million, up 11.6% from last year and 1.6% from last quarter. Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance due to a stronger than expected December performance. Travel nurse volumes were better than expected and the sales team did a great job of rebooking the majority of travelers displaced from assignment due to hurricane Sandy. For the full year 2012, we reported revenue of $954 million, a 7.5% increase from 2011. Our gross margin for the quarter was 28.5%, up 20 basis points from last year and flat from last quarter. The year-over- year increase was due to margin improvements in both the Locum Tenens and Physician Permanent Placement segment, more than offsetting a lower gross margin in the Nurse and Allied segment. Full year 2012 gross margin of 28.3% was up 20 basis points from last year, due primarily to an increase in the Locum Tenens segment. SG&A in the quarter totaled $53 million or 21.4% of revenue, compared to 22.1% in the same quarter last year and 21.5% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year SG&A margin improvement was due to improved operating leverage. The sequential SG&A margin improvement was due to lower professional liability expenses, partially offset by higher bad debt expenses. Full year 2012 SG&A was $202.9 million, or 21.3% of revenue, representing a 70 basis point improvement from the prior year. Our fourth quarter Nurse and Allied segment revenue increased 18.1% from the prior year and sequentially by 5.2% to $175 million. Volume grew 14.3% year-over-year and 3.2% sequentially to an average of 6,075 clinicians on assignment. As a side note, this is the highest volume level since 2008. Revenue per day was up 3.4% year-over-year and 1.9% sequentially due to an increase in the average bill rate and our favorable business mix. Nurse and Allied gross margin of 26.6% was lower year-over-year by 80 basis points with improved bill pay spreads being more than offset by higher housing and insurance costs. Gross margin was relatively stable sequentially. For the full year 2012, Nurse and Allied revenue was $653.8 million, up 14.6% from the prior year. Full year segment gross margin was 26.5%, down 30 basis points from the prior year due to a prior year $2 million favorable workers’ compensation reserve adjustment. Excluding this adjustment, gross margin was flat as housing and insurance cost increases were offset by improved bill pay spreads. Fourth quarter Locum Tenens segment revenue of $62.7 million was 2.8% below prior year and down 7.2% sequentially. Gross margin of 28% was up by 250 basis points from the prior year due primarily to improved bill rates and bill-pay spreads. It was down sequentially by 40 basis points due to lower perm convergences. For the full year, Locum Tenens segment revenue was $261.4 million, down 5.9% from the prior year. Full year gross margin of 27.9% was higher than the prior year by 210 basis points. The margin improvement resulted from bill-pay spread increases across all of our specialties. Our fourth quarter Physician Permanent Placement segment reported revenue of $10.1 million, up year- over-year by 7.9% and sequentially by 1.2%. Gross margin improved by 350 basis points from the prior year and 110 basis points from the prior quarter from improved recruiter productivity and a favorable reduction to our sales reserve due to improved trending in our sales adjustments. For the full year, Physician Permanent Placement revenue was $38.7 million as compared to $38.9 million in the prior year. Without the impact of deferred revenue and accounting changes implemented in 2011, segment revenue was up from the prior year by 9%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $19.2 million, representing 7.8% of revenue. This compares to $15.8 million or 7.1% of revenue in the prior year quarter. Interest expense in the quarter was $3.2 million, which compares to $5.6 million last year and $3.7 million last quarter. Our tax rate in the quarter was 35%, which included a favorable $740,000 adjustment from the statute expiration of a state tax reserve. Excluding this item, our tax rate for the quarter was 42%. This adjustment represents $0.02 of earnings per share. Reported net income from continuing operations was $7.1 million in the fourth quarter and $16.3 million for the full year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.15 for the fourth and quarter and $0.35 for the full year 2012. Excluding the impact of debt refinancing and amendment cost and Medfinders integration expenses in the prior year, adjusted EPS for 2012 was $0.47 as compared to $0.16 in 2011. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $18.5 million and for the full year was $60.5 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $1.7 million and for the full year were $5.5 million. Day sales outstanding were 53 days compared to 54 days in the last quarter and 57 days last year. As of December 31, our cash and equivalents totaled $5.7 million and our total debt outstanding net of discount was $158 million, a $44 million reduction from a year ago. Our yearend leverage ratio as calculated for our credit agreement was 2.4x as compared to 2.3x at the end of last year. The Company made $12 million of voluntary debt prepayments during the fourth quarter. Now let's turn to our guidance for the first quarter. Consolidated revenue is expected to be between $246 million and $250 million, representing year-over-year revenue growth of 9% to 10%. This reflects 2 fewer calendar days in the first quarter which primarily has an impact on our nurse staffing businesses. Gross margin is expected to be between 28% to 28.5%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be 21% to 21.5%, and adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be between 7.5% and 8%. For the first quarter, we expect interest expense to be $3 million and non-cash stock based compensation expense to be $1.6 million. Our first quarter and full year 2013 tax rate is expected to be 43%. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2.5 million in the first quarter and $10 million for the full year. And diluted share count is expected to be $47.6 million for the first quarter and approximately $48 million for the full year. And with that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Susan. Susan R. Salka President, CEO & Director Thank you so much, Amy. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to AMN Healthcare's 2013 Full Year and Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. In 2013, AMN made significant strides in executing on our long-term strategy. Despite a somewhat challenging healthcare environment, we continued to deliver solid revenue and profitability growth, as well as further differentiating AMN as the innovator in healthcare workforce solutions and staffing services. Our full year consolidated revenue grew by 6%, adjusted EBITDA grew by 16%, and earnings per share increased 97%. We continue to drive operating leverage with adjusted EBITDA margin for the year increasing to 8.4%, a 70 basis point improvement towards our long-term goal of 10%. Our top line growth was led by our Locum Tenens and physician permanent placement businesses, both of which delivered strong revenue growth of 10% and 9%. A key part of our strategy is the continued expansion of our leadership position in workforce solutions. In 2013, MSP penetration was up across all of our staffing businesses. Full year direct revenues through MSP contracts represented nearly 30% of our consolidated revenue. We were particularly encouraged with the increased appetite for Locum's MSP and expect this trend to continue into 2014 and beyond. The closer relationships and higher fill rates we achieve through MSP contracts enables us to grow faster during periods of market expansion and provide some protection during periods of demand softness. In November, we acquired ShiftWise, the leading provider of vendor management technology in healthcare. ShiftWise's VMS enables clients to efficiently manage their contingent staffing needs on one centralized platform. ShiftWise is the largest vendor-neutral technology solution within healthcare and it can also be used by staffing companies to be the technology engine of MSP offerings. AMN is beginning to integrate ShiftWise into our MSP offering, and we expect our clients and affiliate vendors will see a tremendous advantage from implementation of this technology. We believe there is quite a bit of runway for further penetration in both vendor-neutral VMS and MSP within the healthcare market. ShiftWise also offers technology that allows clients to manage their in-house resource pools more efficiently and automates credentials management, scheduling and timekeeping. ShiftWise is a perfect complement within AMN's portfolio of workforce solutions, and we are very excited to have the ShiftWise team members as part of the AMN family. Throughout 2013, we experienced robust double-digit growth in our other workforce solutions, such as recruitment process outsourcing and EMR staffing. Similar to ShiftWise, these 2 value-added services are smaller in revenue but they are higher in operating margin, and they help strengthen our position as the strategic partner who can respond to our clients' diverse needs. Now let's review the fourth quarter results of our 3 business segments. I'll start first with our largest segment of Nurse and Allied Staffing, which has been the most affected by the softer hospital census and reimbursement changes over the last year. Fourth quarter revenue for this segment was down 6% year- over-year and 4% sequentially. Margins remain a strength with fourth quarter margins coming in 110 basis points over prior year and 30 basis points over prior quarter. Our travel nurse fourth quarter revenue was down 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Our traditional travel nurse volumes and revenue did increase sequentially during the fourth quarter. However, this was more than offset by the seasonal slowdown in our EMR staffing revenue. Although orders increased from the third to the fourth quarter, overall demand was still softer year-over-year. Since the beginning of 2014, weekly orders had been consistently trending upward. January orders were still below prior year levels but February orders have improved nearly 20% and are now slightly above prior year. We expect this demand pick-up to translate into increased volumes in the second quarter. For first quarter, we expect travel nurse revenue to be up sequentially by 2% to 3%, but down year-over- year. This business, along with our other staffing businesses was impacted by the winter storms earlier this year. Brian will give you a little bit more color on that during his first quarter guidance remarks. The same demand environment is also affecting local staffing where fourth quarter revenue was down both year-over-year and sequentially. The lower revenue has been due mainly to the lower census and cautious hiring by our clients, as well as some impact from the winter storm. First quarter revenues for local staffing are expected to be down year-over-year but flat sequentially. Now turning to Allied Staffing. Fourth quarter revenue was down 15% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was driven by the lower therapy volumes, partially offset by increases in imaging, lab and pharmacy specialties. The sequential decline was due to normal seasonal trends. Our team continues to focus on increasing our [indiscernible] particularly at MSP accounts. Overall, Allied orders have somewhat stabilized going into the first quarter and are currently flat with prior year. First quarter Allied Staffing is expected to be down in the mid-teens year-over-year, and in the mid single- digits sequentially. Overall, for the Nurse and Allied Staffing segment, we expect first quarter revenue to be down in the mid single-digits year-over-year, and to be up 1% to 3% sequentially. Despite the mixed demand trends and cautious client mindset, we believe that we will perform better than most due to our leadership position in MSP and workforce solution. We are also encouraged by the increases in demand that we've seen over the last 6 weeks. The Locum Tenens segment was a bright spot for the fourth quarter, as it has been throughout 2013. Fourth quarter revenue was up 18% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially due to seasonality. In the fourth quarter, we were engaged in 2 large client projects, which favorably offsets the typical seasonal decline of 7% to 9%. The year-over-year revenue improvement was driven mainly by growth in the hospitals, advanced practice, emergency medicine and primary care specialties. Overall days available, which is our measure of demand, grew by nearly 10% over the prior year, helping to fuel the growth. The divisions focused on pricing continues to pay off with gross margin reaching a record high of 29.9%. While we're pleased with these improvements in gross margin, we believe we are still under-market in pricing and there is additional room for growth margin expansion. In addition, our efforts to be the first to market in Locums MSP continue to pay off. In the fourth quarter, we closed 2 more Locums MSP contracts with implementation currently underway. Our MSP revenue mix in Locums is still in the single-digits, but we expect the penetration to continue growing based on our sales pipeline and strong client interest. Going into the first quarter, we expect the Locums segment to experience year-over-year revenue growth in the mid single-digits but to be down sequentially. Part of this sequential decline is due to the completion of the 2 client projects that I mentioned, the remainder is due to weaker placements. The positive impact of new Locums MSP clients will help this segment to increase revenue momentum during the remainder of 2014. Now let's turn to our physician permanent placement segment where fourth quarter revenue was up 4% year-over-year and down 4% due to holiday seasonality. The year-over-year growth was driven by higher placements in our retained search business. Based on increasing new search activity, we expect first quarter perm placement revenue to be up in the high single-digit year-over-year and also up sequentially. With 2013 well behind us, the AMN team is very focused on 2014 and the opportunities that lie ahead. Healthcare providers have tightened spending for several quarters now, and as a result, many are operating with a very lean workforce today. We find that when they do approve an order with us, their needs are very urgent. Over time, we would expect demand for temporary and permanent staff to increase as general unemployment continues to decline, more individuals enroll and become eligible for insurance, patient volumes increase and clinician shortages worsen. In a recent AMN survey, nearly 2/3 of hospital executives said they believed the influx of newly insured patients will increase the need for physicians and nurses at their facilities. With clinical labor representing half of a hospital's cost structure, providers will continue to seek and adopt more outsourced workforce solutions so that they can more efficiently address their labor needs. The demand for healthcare services is generally expected to expand in 2014, as the impact of the Affordable Care Act unfolds. To ensure that AMN is best positioned as the partner of choice for clients, and to capitalize on the future demand trends, we continue to make investments in 3 key areas: The first is expanding and driving growth through our suite of innovative workforce solutions; the second is our leading-edge recruitment technologies to aggressively attract more candidate supply and to create a better experience; and the third is the streamlining of our systems and infrastructure to create greater efficiency, scalability and agility. These investments are essential to delivering revenue growth and operating leverage as we progress towards our long-term goal of a 10% adjusted EBITDA margin. Finally, I would like to thank our AMN team members for their dedication and passion in serving our clients and clinicians and for their strong execution. We have a very healthy performance-driven and values-based culture within AMN. Our team members take great pride in our contributions to the healthcare industry and the patients that they serve. They also take great pride in our commitment to our communities and corporate social responsibilities. We are proud of our talented team and the impact that they make every day on our clients, our clinicians, our shareholders and the world around us. I will come back to you in our Q&A section, along with Ralph and Bob, to help answer your questions. But for now, I will turn the call over to Brian. Brian M. Scott Chief Accounting Officer, CFO & Treasurer Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. The company's fourth quarter revenue of $248.7 million was up 0.3% from last year, and down 3.3% from last quarter. Our gross margin for the quarter was 29.8%, up 130 basis points from last year and 40 basis points from last quarter. The year-over-year and sequential increase was due mainly to margin improvements in both our Locum Tenens and Nurse and Allied segments. SG&A in the quarter totaled $54.5 million or 21.9% of revenue, compared to 21.4% in the same quarter last year and 21.6% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase in SG&A was due primarily to higher expenses related to driving growth in the business and additional ShiftWise SG&A for the post-acquisition period. SG&A expenses declined sequentially due to lower professional liability and employee-related cost, more than offsetting the additional ShiftWise expenses. Our fourth quarter Nurse and Allied segment revenue decreased 6.2% from the prior year and 4% sequentially to $164.1 million. Volume of 5,609 average clinicians on assignment was lower by 7.7% year-over-year and 2.8% sequentially. Revenue per day was up 1.6% year-over-year with our average bill rate higher by 0.6% over last year. Nurse and Allied gross margin of 27.7% was higher year-over-year by 110 basis points and sequentially by 30 basis points. The year-over-year and sequential improvement was due to improved bill pay spreads and a favorable business mix shift to higher-margin workforce solutions including the newly acquired ShiftWise business. These positive trends more than offset continued higher housing cost pressure. Segment SG&A in the quarter included a $1.4 million favorable actuarial adjustment to the professional liability reserve. Fourth quarter Nurse and Allied segment operating margin of 11.9% was lower by 40 basis points year-over-year and flat from the prior quarter, with a year-over-year reduction resulting from negative operating leverage on lower revenue. Fourth quarter Locum Tenens segment revenue of $74.1 million was up 18.1% from prior year and down 1.6% sequentially. A 13.9% increase in days filled was the biggest driver of the year-over-year increase. Revenue per day sales increased by 3.7%, as bill rate increases in all specialties were partially offset by a mix shift to lower bill rate specialties. Gross margin of 29.9% was 190 basis points higher than the prior year and 60 basis points higher sequentially, due primarily to improved bill pay spreads and a mix shift the higher-margin specialties. Fourth quarter Locum Tenens segment operating margin of 9.9% was higher by 220 basis points year- over-year and down 10 basis points in the prior quarter. The year-over-year increase was due mainly to the gross margin improvement while the sequential decrease was due mainly to higher bad debt expense. Our fourth quarter Physician Permanent Placement segment revenue of $10.5 million was up year-over- year by 3.6%, but down by 3.8% sequentially due to seasonality. Gross margin of 63% was lower by 220 basis points in the prior year and up 40 basis points in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease was due to a sales reserve reduction recorded last year and an increase in recruiter headcount this year to drive future placement growth. Physician Perm Placement fourth quarter operating margin of 21% was higher by 50 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points from the prior quarter with a year-over-year increase due to improved SG&A leverage. Interest expense in the quarter was $1.8 million, which compares to $3.2 million last year and $1.8 million last quarter. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter and for the full year was 41%. We reported net income of $8.4 million in the fourth quarter and $32.9 million for the full year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.17 for the fourth quarter, which compares to $0.15 in the prior year quarter. Full year 2013 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.69, which compares to $0.35 in 2012. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $15.5 million, and for the full year, was $58.6 million. Days sales outstanding were 55 days compared to 52 days in the last quarter and 53 days last year. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $2.6 million, and for the full year, were $9 million. As of December 31, our cash and equivalents totaled $15.6 million and our total debt outstanding was $158.7, which included $10 million drawn on our revolver in conjunction with the ShiftWise acquisition. The yearend leverage ratio is calculated as per our credit agreement was 2.0x:1, as compared to 2.4x at the end of last year. Now let's turn to our first quarter 2014 guidance. The company expects consolidated first quarter revenue of $244 million to $248 million. This guidance includes an estimated $2 million to $3 million revenue impact from the winter storms. Gross margin is expected to be between 30% to 30.5% reflecting a full quarter of our higher margin ShiftWise business. SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue are expected to be between 22.5% to 23%, which includes a full quarter of ShiftWise expenses, as well as some strategic investments to drive long-term operating efficiency and expansion of our workforce solutions. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be between 8% and 8.5%. First quarter interest expense is expected to be $1.9 million. Depreciation expense for the first quarter will be $2 million, and amortization expense will be $1.9 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter and full year is expected to be 44%, with a full year cash tax rate expected to be in the low 30% range. Capital expenditures are projected to be $3 million to $4 million for the quarter and approximately $12 million to $14 million for the full year. Diluted share count is expected to be $48 million for the first quarter and $48.2 million for the full year. And with that, we'd like to open up the call for questions."
73,GV_021542_2008Q1,"Presentation Operator Good day and welcome to today's AAON, Inc. first quarter conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host, Norm Asbjornson. Please go ahead sir. Norm Asbjornson Good afternoon. Prior to embarking, I would like to read a forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Thank you. I would like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. Kathy Sheffield Good afternoon. Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing the results of the three months that just ended March 31 and those results of which we are quite proud. Revenues were up 11.8% to $65.5 million from $58.6 million. This increase was primarily due to an increase in both market share and pricing. Gross margin stayed constant for the two years at $15.7 million. The gross margin percentage was 23.9% of sales for the first quarter in '08 compared to 26.8% of sales for the same quarter in '07. Although the margin percentage was less this quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago, it was still a very good margin and the margin being at 23.9% is really a better respectable representation of what we would expect our margins to be. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased for the first quarter by 3.5% to $5.9 million or 9% of sales from $5.7 million or 9.8% of sales. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to an increase in sales related expenses and then just overall general and administrative expense increases. Operating income decreased slightly by 2% to $9.8 million or 14.9% of sales from $10 million or 17% of sales. Net income increased by 1.6% to $6.4 million or 9.8% of sales from $6.3 million or 10.8% of sales for the same period last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.35 per share this quarter compared to $0.33 per share the same quarter a year ago. EPS was based on 18,311,000 shares compared to 18,902,000 shares for the same quarter in 2007. Moving to the balance sheet, our current asset ratio increased slightly to approximately 2.3%, primarily due to an increase in current assets. Capital expenditures for the quarter were right at $1 million and those expenditures were related to equipment purchases which would increase our production efficiencies. Shareholders' equity per share as of March 31 was $5.58 compared to $5.29 last year. During the first quarter in 2008, we paid cash dividends of $2.9 million and also bought back stock from retirement incentive plans and through the open market as well, and paid $1.8 million in total. I would now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with discussion about new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norm Asbjornson Yes, we had record-breaking sales performance, primarily due to having come into the year with a larger backlog than we did in 2007. We had a negative order input in that we did not book quite as much as we did in 2007. Therefore, we pretty much stayed constant with our manpowering. Then coming into the second quarter now, into April this year, there's been an indication that the order is on the upswing. It has been very strong bookings and as a matter of fact, weakness in the first quarter in bookings was in the first two months - January and February, and we had a strong March, stronger than it was a year ago. So it looks like we're gaining strength in the booking department at the present time. Our second quarter actual shipments is pretty well covered with orders which we presently have in the backlog. We still have a little opening for new orders and that is rapidly being taken up. So our problem in the second quarter is not going to be orders. Our challenge is in producing product. In that respect, we sit with kind of the proverbial good and bad situation. The good part of it is that we've got plenty of work to put out the door. The bad part is we're having a difficult time hiring additional personnel, so we're going to be somewhat limited by personnel and that's due to unemployment rate in our metropolitan area of 3.2%. It doesn't give you very many people to pick from. So, our second quarter results on shipment are not going to be limited by orders, they are going to be limited by our ability to get out the door. As I spoke earlier, order input looks very good. Based upon all the signs and everything we see, it looks like a very promising year. However, I also read the paper and listen to news broadcasts and everything and there are, as we all know, several negative things out there in the marketplace and there's a lot of negative discussion. But, I did see some signs of that there in the first two months of this year. But, since that point in time, it doesn't look like it's happening in the construction market, at least for us. So that's kind of the going on situation in that respect. Now, on gross margins, we are seeing a more inflationary environment than we were seeing last year and that is reflected in the results that we obtained for the first quarter. We are at the present time going to have another price increase which is occurring at the end of this month. So that will help us. On what we've got in the backlog right now, basically we had a price increase on December 1 of last year and that didn't get worked through our backlog until the very last part of the last month of last quarter. So what happened last quarter was that the cost increases for material did come through and the price increases weren't effective. The price increase will be effective obviously in most everything for this quarter and the question mark is, are material costs going to continue to increase faster than our cost increases are going to improve. But, time will tell on that, but it is an inflationary environment which we're in. SG&A expenses, as was noted by Kathy, are up in total, but they are down as a percent of sales. They are down from 9.8% to 9% even though they are up in total dollar volume. I expect 9% to be a reasonable estimate for the rest of the year on SG&A. The operating margins at 14 .9% are extremely good for this industry and very happy with it. That's better than our margin of last year 13.6%. This is our best performance in the past four years on operating margin. So that portion of it looks very strong. Of course, it comes around to the net income line which was a record that we had this year. The CapEx, as Kathy noted, we've only spent $1 million so far for basically equipment and we've been giving guidance that we will be spending $7 million to $10 million. That still is an accurate number to be contemplating. We are embarking upon some rework in addition to the building which will use most of that (inaudible). The work is going to be done on the Tulsa facility and that will consume the majority of the balance of that $7 million to $10 million. We believe we have adequate equipment to get ourselves, not only through this year, but through next year with a reasonable amount of growth in it too and what we're setting up in the way of what we're doing on the building portion is not so much what we need this year, it is not, it is for future years. What it will do for us, however, is as we get the building done, it will improve our ability to run some portions of our building - our production a little more efficiently than we would have without this. It will relieve a little tightness we have on a couple production lines. It will provide us what we need for several years in the future in building capacity, so our capital needs in that area will disappear for some time to come and the machinery side of it, we're quite good in, so the company is sitting in extremely good condition and getting better as far as what capital needs we have in the company for substantial growth. Canada has, as you know, had problems ever since we bought it out of bankruptcy. We haven't been making money up there. It continues to be the case. In the first quarter this year, we just still had a very minor loss compared to previous months and previous years and quarters, and we are sitting at a real unpredictable situation because those of you who follow the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar know that we had to implement nearly a 30% price increase on any of the Canadian product which was sold into the United States due to the change in the exchange rate with the Canadian dollar becoming much stronger compared to the U.S. dollar. That, of course, was a hard price increase to sell through to our U.S. customers and it diminished our order input very severely and we have been working off backlog on that operation and the big catch now is because about 80% of our business has historically come out of the U.S. customers for the Canadian operation, is our ability to get orders to maintain that. Our present backlog and our present pricing of our backlog is certainly adequate to make profit. Our problem is when more in getting the personnel trained and working properly, and in getting more orders for the facility. We are, as noted, because of the precariousness of the profitability of that portion of our company, still analyzing its future very significantly. On new products, the air handlers and chillers, which are to varying degrees new products with us are coming on strongly and the addition that we are putting on to the Tulsa facility has a lot to do with the air handler and chiller portion of our business because that is one of the areas that we're squeezed on for space. We have gotten into, after several years of telling you we're heading into it, we have basically gotten into the residential on a very minimal scale and have anticipations that we will be working out the problems of actually making it functional as a marketing system over this year. We are entering one new area of product. There is a system which is many times referred to as a floor by floor unit or a self-contained variable volume system. It's the type of system which is prevalent in New York City for the high-rise market and in other cities for high-rise market. It is a very dominant product line for the New York City market, a little less dominant in some of the other high-rise markets. So it has fairly good volume capabilities depending largely upon high-rise office buildings, of course, for the market. We have another thing which is being introduced and has been introduced by us and by our compressor supplier called a digital scroll compressor which effectively makes small tonnage compressors variable capacity devices. And this has a huge opportunity for a number of reasons, among which is its ability to save energy. It's a very energy-efficient way of improving production. Many of you may be aware of some of our common terminology in our industry called SEERs, in other words Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio or plain EER for larger equipment which is just Energy Efficiency Ratio. That number is one which is at a fixed point, one point of measurement. It doesn't cover the full spectrum of the varying loads that occur due to the varying temperatures and varying internal loads of a building. And so it's a good measurement of the overall capability of a machine to save energy, but it is a very poor measure of its ability to totally do that. What I'm trying to say there is, if you were running it always at that one design point and comparing it, it's a great measure. But that's not the real world. The real world is that it's always varying, your load is, and this digital compressor has a very, very pronounced positive effect upon doing that. It's a new technology. We are in a leadership position of implementing that technology and it we think will be a very pronounced effect upon our ability to compete and also to address the energy issue that we're so involved in, in our industry. Looking at the various kinds of business segments that we involve ourselves in, let's talk about some of the ones that we're into. Probably the strongest one we're into is our education, and that's largely first grade through 12th grade building structures. That market is quite strong, doing very well. We are doing very well in it and it's doing well for us. Our next strong one has been and at one time was our primary one, the retail market. The retail market is a little bit on the weak side at the present time and has, in fact, some people are cutting back, others are not, but it's not a real strong part of the market. So in one respect, we're fortunate that we've redirected our efforts over the past few years more into the educational structure, which is a stronger market at the present time. The other part that has still shown some strength compared to some previous years and was one that was pretty weak for a long time is the office building market. That's not doing badly. And the other part of that which also was having problems in the past and seems to be somewhat stronger now is the manufacturing buildings market. The medical and healthcare portion of the market which is a smaller market but is a very healthy market at this time, as one would expect as our population ages and grows, that market is likewise growing. And then there's our general unqualified type of building which is not covered by one of the aboves and that portion of the business looks pretty strong. So as I mentioned before, if I didn't read the newspaper, didn't listen to the newspaper, I'd think business is quite good. The outlook for the balance of 2008, therefore, is questionable, because there is other news out there that would lead to you believe that you should be concerned. But, what I'm seeing on the order desk and what I see in the immediate future would tell me that it's going to be strong at least for awhile. We have been active in our stock repurchase program. The new program, which began in November of '07 and blacked out most of the time because of the end of the year, will be reentered by us this Friday. The remaining shares we have yet to purchase on that is 1,028,900 shares. As Kathy noted earlier, we have already purchased some this past quarter and we purchased quite a few in the fourth quarter. Basically, we purchased almost 800,000 of our initial authorization out of that. With that, I will open it to question and answers."

Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter report. I have with me Kathy Sheffield, our Vice President and CFO. And I will turn this over to her after reading the disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control. It could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy Sheffield. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'd like to begin today by discussing the results for the three months ended March 31. Our revenues were down 23% to $49.3 million from $64 million a year ago. We continue to this first quarter of 2010 to be affected by the current economic environment which we are in, and that has resulted in negatively impacting the commercial construction market. Our gross profit decreased 23.1% to $13 million from $16.9 million. Gross profit was 26.4% of sales compared to 26.5% of sales in 2009 as a percent of sales. The gross margin percentages remain consistent as I they had despite the lower sales primarily to our continuing efforts to improve labor and production efficiencies and also reduction in manufacturing-regulated expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the first quarter by 26.2% to $4.8 million or 9.8% of sales from $6.5 million or 10.2% of sales. The decrease was due to a lower bad debt expense which we incurred that reduced our bad debt reserve, a the decrease in our warranty expenses related to fewer sales and a reduction in our sales-regulated expenses. Our operating income decreased by 21.2% to $8.2 million or 16.6% of sales from $10.4 million or 16.3% of sales. Net income decreased by 23.9% to $5.1 million or 10.4% of sales from $6.7 million or 10.5% of sales. Our diluted earnings per share was $0.30 per share for this quarter compared to $0.39 per share a year ago. And our earnings per share were calculated on 17,271,000 versus 17,335,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. Now moving to the balance sheet. We see that we have a lot of cash. We've continued to hold a strong liquidity position, $15.6 million in cash which aids our goal to stay liquid as possible during the economic terms and times that we're still experiencing. Our current assets ratio was 3:1. Our capital expenditures for the quarter, we spent $3.5 million. These expenditures primarily related to the expansion and remodel of our Tulsa manufacturing facility. Shareholders' equity per share was $7.09 compared to $6.85 in 2009. We paid cash dividends of $5.9 million during 2009 and declared dividends of $3.1 million, which we paid in January of 2010. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail along with our new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you, Kathy. Since the economy is so prevalent in what's happening to AAON, I thought I'd review a couple of indicators, which we used to watch. One is architectural billing index, which has remained below the 50% mark which is a neutral position compared to the previous year. It's down in the forties, but that is an improvement from its low point in 2009. So it is still on a continuing downtrend, but it's not as severe a downtrend as it was earlier, is what that tells me. The other thing I look at is the nonresidential construction put in place on a seasonally adjusted annual rate, and I look at previous trend lines within that going all the way back into the 1990s, and I find it fairly consistently, January will be the weakest month of the quarter, the first quarter. And pretty level some time. It's generally if any trend, its trending up a little bit through March. This year it even compared, say, to 2009. 2009 it trended up from $395,000, up to $401,000 in the first quarter. This year, it's trended down from 305,000 to 298,000. So not a big reversal, but the trend line is still in wrong direction. So while we we're looking at what the architects are doing the way of building plans or what's actually being spent, we do see the kind of a reversal that we'd hope, which is the architects are not growing, but they're not falling as fast as they work but the falloff for that, of course, is that the building itself follows the architect and it's doing as you kind of expect, and that it's still going down a little faster than you would expect or it's direction is wrong. So we're not at the bottom, which some industries are saying that they are. The noncommercial or nonresidential building industry doesn't show those signs yet. On a positive note, AAON has had success with our new products at running a little better than our industry. And the indication of that is our backlog. Our backlog in 2009 this time at the end of March was $43,900. And the backlog at the end of 2009, December 31, was $35,756,000 and it trended up to $41,398,000 on the 31 of this year. So comparing year-to-year, the comparison is $43,009 compared to $41,004, which is a decline. However, the 35,007 at the end of last year shows that we've increased our backlog by a little less than $6 million, which is a fairly significant amount. So one would ask why we would have that, what the trends or what's occurring there. Well, what I interpret is two things. We did have a fairly severe winter in parts of the United States this year, and some of that backlog, under a more normal winter would have shipped, did not ship in the first quarter. The second thing which has occurred is that we've have a little weaker beginning to the first quarter but then we have is a finish. In other words, we were accelerating our order input a little bit, and therefore some of the orders came in too late to be shipped in the first quarter, and therefore ended up in our backlog. So the trend line on our bookings performance during the quarter was counter to what the business was actually doing and the way of what nonresidential construction was doing. So that's a positive thing, saying that we're running counter to it a little bit. Other than that, since the 31st of March, we've had a kind of a mediocre April, and that we're still down considerably. We're down about 20% from the previous year in our bookings for that period. But as the months wore on, as April went into May, we got a stronger position, and we're definitely running a little stronger position now. And again, the other trend line is saying that things in our camp, while they're not able to overcome all the downward trend in the industry, totally, we may becoming close to it as we're moving forward. Now what is happening within AAON to have that occur? Well, over half of our product line as far as dollars, where we get our dollars from, have been new products in the past year and a half to two years. That includes all of our rooftop products from 30 tons all the way down to 2 tons, although the 5 tons to 2 tons aren't in production yet. We're taking orders on those products now. And on our air handling units and smaller chillers out of Longview, both of those products are new products. So those products have changed the character of our marketing approach and our ability to get orders. So we are on a positive company-wide growth position. If the economy would just stop, level off and pick up and start get going, we would be in a very good shape, I think. But that hasn't yet occurred as far as we can see, although it is definitely moderating, no question about that. And so it does have signs that before too much longer it may hit a leveling and a growing position again. Now what is it about the new products that give me this great confidence and give the customers the desire to buy our products? Well, in the case of the rooftop products, we've made a very significant forward step. Energy is extremely important thing in our economy and in the heating, air conditioning equipment sales, and energy is usually measured on the ability to convert energy into cooling or energy into heating. And the whole industry is working hard on that and doing a very fine job, I think, of improving the production of heating and production of cooling. The one thing that we have added to that is there's more to it than just the production of the heating or the production of the cooling. The device in the case of the rooftop, the box in which that heating and cooling takes place, is by our industry standards what I consider absolutely a terrible product. And it was one similar to what we used to have, which is a piece of sheet metal with about one inch of this fiberglass insulation on it, and that compares to, say, your house with, who knows, eight or 10 inches of fiberglass installation and couple of walls and plaster board, and whatever else. So it had a very poor resistance to heat transfer. We have addressed that, and we are now marketing our entire rooftop product line with two walls of metal filled by two inches of foam, which is on an insulating value, about twice the insulating value of fiberglass. In other words, it's equivalent to the four-inch fiberglass wall pretty much, which while that may not be revolutionary compared to the building itself, compared to our competitors, it is 5x, 6x or 7x better a box than what they're using to build their product. The other aspect is that it's not always on heating, and it's not always on cooling, much of the time, it's just moving air. In other words, the fan is on but nothing's really happening, or whatever's happening is a modest amount of heating or a modest amount of cooling. So the fan horsepower becomes a bigger factor. And in much of the United States, a fan horsepower sometimes can consume as much energy as the heating and cooling does because it runs pretty much continuously in much of the units and the other items are over intermittent. So moving air is a very considerable importance. And towards that end we've eliminated V-belt drives entirely on our total product line of rooftops, and we put direct drive motor directly to the blower. And the blower is a more efficient blower type and well recognized as such by our industry as single-bladed airfoil as opposed to a forward curve, which diminishes the amount of horsepower necessary to move air. So those two things are recognized by our customers as being important as well as the cost of producing the energy, whether heating or cooling. And this is a major thing because it requires 100% redesign of one product's line and a lot of technical problems to be addressed to get where we are, and our competitors are not there at this point in time. So going forward, we think that's going to become a more and more important factor to our customers and will give us an additional sales advantage, and that seems to be borne out by what is occurring right now. Although in addition to changing the product, we must say that we've upped the efficiency of producing heating and cooling, and we now have cooling that runs all the way up to SEER [Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio] of 19 on our smallest unit. And there are various categories that allow the reward of the owners buying high-efficiency equipment by some of the utilities giving rebates for the purchase of high-efficiency equipment. And with the two exceptions. On our rooftop product line, from 70 tons down where it's primarily being given, we can achieve the highest rebate possible by any of the utilities, which they call a Tier 2. So we've got a lot of things going for us in this energy environment, and that is primarily the story of AAON at this present time with one other important thing, we are moving our products over into the West side facility here in Tulsa from the East side. We're moving one of our primary dollar contributors over this month. And while we won't lose any production days in that move, we will slow the productivity down and hurt us a little bit on our productivity. The second thing that will happen is we are getting out of the old two- to five-ton product business and going into the new two- to five-ton product, which is an immense improvement, but it also will have an adverse effect on our productivity a little bit. So a lot of good things are happening, but there are a few things that will have a negative impact on us. Of course, both those things will be in place starting into the third quarter and will be contributing even better to us than what we're capable of doing today as far as improving productivity. With that and the apparent opening up to some degree, not very much of credit lines for people wanting to build commercial buildings. I believe the turn in the commercial building market is very close at hand. I don't believe it's here yet, but I think it's very close at hand. And the question remains then how vibrant will that turn be, and I can't give any idea on that. With that, I'd like to open it up to question and answers."
75,GV_021542_2011Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the AAON Inc. Conference Call Covering the Financial Results for the First Quarter ended March 31. I will now turn it over to your host, Norman Asbjornson. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. Before going into it, I'm going to read the forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained on our most recent SEC filings including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Thank you. Good morning -- or good afternoon, I'd like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO, and she will go through some of the information with you. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon, welcome to our first quarter conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing the results for the 3 months. Our revenues were up 22% to $59.9 million from $49.3 million. Our revenues increased as a result of the favorable reception to our new products, a successful trade show that we held in January of this year and our ability to gain additional market share. Our gross profit decreased 11% to $11.6 million from $13 million. Gross profit was 19.4% of sales compared to 26.4% of sales last year. Now the gross profit was a percentage of decrease due to a number of factors, including increased labor costs and labor inefficiencies associated with the severe snowstorm damage that we had at our Tulsa production facility in February which resulted in 8 1/2 half days of lost production, which also affected 3 production lines. Norman would address this subject in greater detail in his discussion to follow. The decrease is also attributable to escalating raw material cost that we were unable to pass on to our customers in the first quarter, and an increase in manufacturing supplies related to the increased sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15% to $5.5 million or 9.3% of sales from $4.8 million or 9.8% of sales. The increase is primarily due to increase selling expenses related to a specific trade show that we mentioned earlier and warranty expenses related to an increase in sales, offset by a decrease in profit sharing, which corresponds to the lower net income. Operating income decreased 25% to $6.1 million or 10.1% of sales from $8.2 million or 16.6% of sales. Net income decreased 27% to $3.7 million or 6.1% of sales from $5.1 million or 10.4% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.22 versus $0.30 per share the same quarter of last year. Earnings per share were based on 16,626,000 shares versus 17,271,000 shares. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that our receivables have decreased $1.3 million and that has been accomplished with higher sales. Our inventory has increased due to increased volume, increased backlog but primarily due to pre-buying of material to avoid raw material and component part increases. Our current asset ratio was 2.2:1. We had capital expenditures of $10.3 million and that was related to the some additional machinery equipment purchases and a new building addition that we started here in Tulsa. Shareholders’ equity per share is $7.27, compared to $7.09. We currently pay cash dividends of $0.36 annually and the stock split which we announced today, will create a dividend of $0.24 annually. We did have some intermittent borrowing on our revolving loan agreement and we do have investments maturing. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes, I'd like, first of all, to talk about our volume in our sales, which were up 22% from a year ago. And let's compare that to what the newest Census Bureau's March report says is the situation in buildings. And I'll just read them off very quickly and tell you how that gets us. Commercial and retail, down 6.5%; office buildings, down 13.7%; medical and health, down 3.2%; education, down 9.2%; manufacturing, down 28%; lodging, down 31%; municipalities, down 2.3%. So now we have to go up and dig in to that and say, what do we think, I would say, conservatively, the markets that we were serving out of those groups were down at least 10%. If you add that to the 22% up that we are and says we took a minimal of 32% away from the rest of the industry players in there. So we're feeling quite good about that. That's due primarily to 2 factors, which have occurred as we've been talking for several past quarters, we did not slowdown our company at all during this recession. We reinvested our time in development of new products. The new products have been very well received by the industry. And as an effort to expose the industry more thoroughly to what these products are, we chose to do something which we have never done in the past, which was create our own trade show. We did that in conjunction with an industry-wide trade show called ASHRAE [American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers], which held a meeting on January 30, through the first 3 days of February in Las Vegas. They also have an opening house and trade show, but that exposes our products to everybody who wants to come to the trade show and we thought that was ill-advised. So we worked the deal out with a casino out there, rented their parking lot, put up a very large circus tent, brought 6 truck loads of the equipment somewhere around $1.5 million worth out and held an all-day open house by invitation only to select personnel throughout the United States and some international. People we consider to be very influential in determining what products get purchased in our industry, for the most part consulting engineers. We had somewhere close to 4,000 attendees. We started out, our initial goal was to get over 1,000 so we were immensely successful in bringing in a lot of these people. This trade show was noticeably, made a noticeable difference based upon the trend line of our sales since the trade show prior compared to this trend line of our, I shouldn't say sales, I should say order entry. The trend line of the order entry prior of the trade show. So we did do just what we tried to do, we influenced some more sales coming our direction. It resulted in getting us that 22% up from a year ago. The new products and the fact that we were able to show them to people who really needed to evaluate them. So we're feeling quite good about where we are in the industry at this point in time. We basically have the bulk of our products are just redesigned in the past couple 3 years. And we're evolved in still some more work at the present time, in that area, because we have great confidence in what we were doing. We have been embarking upon considerable building of our facilities and our manufacturing capabilities in order to take care of what we believe to be an upward trend and in our sales. And we believe a healthier situation in the industry. If we evaluate the industry, we'll see that it's been on a noticeable downswing. The peak of the industry occurred in the early part of 2008, and it's been on a continually downswing almost without any change since that time until about October and November of last year, when we did get a little bit of a rise only to start back down again in December, on into January. However, from January of this year, we had a slight rise going on for the first 3 months. So we are in that part of the industry cycle now, whereby we're more or less stable and it looks like maybe we got a slight increase occurring. Now you have to recognize that what I said was in January of this year. We were coming into a further decline so compared to January a year ago, it was substantially less. In March, we have still not climbed back up to where March of the year ago is, but the general trend of it is to indicate that the probability is that the industry will pick up enough volume throughout the year, so that it will somewhere near balance out with last year's volume in the industry, and we intend to have considerably more of it in our camp. The new products, the response to the new products, you're kind of wondering what are we talking about. Well, we're doing particularly well in rooftops as our traditional place of being. But we're also doing quite well in split systems, which is primarily due to our Longview facility, and we're growing in that endeavor at a very healthy rate as well. So it's not limited to the rooftops any longer, it's also split systems. In addition to which we went into what is called by some people in our industry, a 4x4 system, it's a product line which basically has been used a lot in high-rise facilities all the way up to the highest high rise built, and that has been growing very nicely for us. We also are doing pretty well in the chiller business and we've been spending some effort there as well as in our regular air handlers. So the world is looking much broader to us than our historical rooftop only market. We are now becoming significant in other areas. So things are looking good in that endeavor. We are having one difficulty, however, in that, because we now have gotten more capability in our ability to build equipment. We now have the ability to overrun our order input. And so, we're not able to ship as fast as we want simply because the customers at this point in time are not ready for delivery of the equipment. The forward look, however, is of course that those orders are going to go out this summer. So we would anticipate that the second quarter will have an upswing and probably a further upswing in the third quarter if things continue as they are presently. Our backlog at 3/31 of $48 million, was significantly greater than our backlog a year ago. We did have, however, a glitch in our report a year ago wherein we had some intercompany reported in the backlog that we've reported a year ago. But the fact is at the present time, it's correcting for that little glitch that we have, we're comparing the $48 million to $36.1 million a year ago. And so, that's indicative of the upswing in the orders of which I spoke, and which was represented by our 22% increase so far this year. The gross margin has had a pretty bad beating for a number of reasons. The effect of the snowstorm in Tulsa primarily being the biggest culprit in it. As a for instance, things that one would normally expect but do have effect. A lot of our personal took vacation time when we were shut down, which of course depleted the reserve we had for vacations and by the way, in which we work, our thing we had to increase some $300,000 in our reserve for vacations even though that will probably work its way back out in the future. That hit our bottom line. We had effects of the damage that we had on the building. Also, that had an effect on the way we ran and for instance, the indirect labor that we had to expand was due to the damage that we had and the problems we had that it took another pretty good chunk of our money. Now we also mentioned that the profit was diminished by the fact that we had variances from commodities and purchase parts. Those 2 things combined had a net earnings per share effect after all things were considered of $0.03 on our profit per share. So you can see that we had a number of things to deal with. Toward that end, we had a price increase on our product at the end of last year, in our Longview facility of about 5%. And the end of March, we put a approximately a 5% in to effect on most of the products from the Tulsa facility. That won't immediately result in change in our bottom line, however, because we have considerable backlog with previous price product in it. So the results of that will start finding their way onto the P&L statement sometime in June, but not before. We believe that the price increases we've affected will overcome the cost increases and everything that we've had. And we've got an additional thing which is occurring in here that's causing us cost which is we are moving production lines around and making them more efficient. We've had a considerable amount of discussion and study going on for a number of years on how to improve our productivity, and we're embarking, and did last year, last quarter in some of them and we're continuing on that. We've made one change in one production line this quarter, this past quarter. We will have another one or two changes of production lines going on in the quarter we're in now. And all of these things will improve our productivity. So that also we'll give a help to the price increase toward putting it on to the bottom line. If we had had no snowstorm at all, we would have had approximately the same gross margin this year as we had last year, but that as we both know, was not what happened to us. So looking at what else is going on, the SG&A, of course, has slipped or gone up a little bit and a lot of that has to do with the increased volume. Personnel-wise, we are now just passing into a new level of more personnel than we've ever had in the past. Some of that is predicated upon the fact that we are hiring and training in anticipation of continued growth. The $3.7 million for the quarter was a disappointment to us compared to the $5.1 million a year ago, but when we look at what all we had to go through, we're still pretty proud of the situation. We're still in a good cash position at this point in time. We are borrowed some on our line of credit right now, but we anticipate most of the capital expenditures to occur fairly quickly in this year and we'll probably be in somewhat a minor borrowing position for the mid part of the year coming out of that situation towards the end of the year. And a lot of this is all predicated upon what we spoke of a little bit before here by improve efficiencies. We are exchanging some of our earlier computerized sheet metal equipment. We turned it in because we basically warranted out and the newer equipment that we're getting in is a faster and more efficient than the equipment, which we are obsoleting. So it will give us some additional ability to lower our cost on our product. So there's a lot going on in the company all predicated upon a healthier economy and healthier business climate for us and more growth for the company. I'd like to thank everyone for this time and now I'd like to open it for audience participation. I'm now open for questions."

And now, I'd like to introduce our Vice President of finance, Kathy Sheffield, who will go over some of the statistics with us. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon. Welcome to our conference call. Thank you for joining us for this review of AAON's financial performance for the first quarter of 2012. I'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, to March 31, 2011. Our revenues were up 8.4% to $64.9 million from $59.9 million. The increase in our revenues is the result of our continuation of gains and market shares due to the favorable reception of our new products. Gross profit increased 16.2% to $13.5 million from $11.6 million. As a percentage of sales, gross profit for the quarter was 20.8% compared to 19.4% a year ago. The increase in gross profit is attributable to the improved productivity from our new sheet metal fabrication equipment that we put into service at the end of last year and our revamp production lines. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 8% to $5.9 million from $5.5 million for the same period a year ago. As a percentage of sales, SG&A remain constant at 9.2% of sales. Operating income increased approximately 24% to $7.6 million or 11.6% of sales from $6.1 million or 10.2% of sales. Net income increased 25.1% to $4.6 million or 6.9% of sales from $3.7 million or 6.1% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.18 per share versus $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. Earnings per share were based on 24,772,000 shares versus 24,939,000 shares. Moving to the balance sheet, we see that we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.2 million and we had no long-term debt. We had a working capital balance of $48.1 million, current asset ratio was 2:1, our capital expenditures were approximately $3 million related to new equipment and the continuation of a building addition. Our shareholders' equity per share was $5.13 compared to $4.85 a year ago. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm who will discuss our results in further detail along with our new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Yes. We'd like to talk a little bit about the -- basically, the differences in the 2 major places where we got our orders, namely new construction and the second one being replacement market. We had, coming into this year, quite a different situation due to things which occurred last year, most namely the replacement markets. The replacement market last year was distorted toward the first part of the year on orders entered due to the 100% write-off that was given to certain capital and the product such as the heating air conditioning equipment by the federal government. And therefore, the first part of last year was very good bookings year -- year the last half was a very poor one, which bring that up kind of set the stage for what has happened in the first quarter of this year. We namely came into this first quarter of this year with a pretty low backlog due to the fact that we had shipped everything to the people who were buying it because they wanted it badly last year to get into the tax break for many of them. And they were not giving us a lot of the orders. So it didn't look really too promising coming off of last year relative to the backlog. And in the first 10 days of January, it kind of continued that way, and then the world changed, the remarkable way. Orders started coming in very rapidly and continued to do so and still continue to do so. They're coming in not at the same rapid rate that they have at various times during the past few months, but consistently been good booking months. January turned out to be a very, very good booking month even though it started out very slow for 10 days. Net result of all that was that, of course, in January because we came into it with a low backlog, it does take time to ramp up your manufacturing and have the people and everything going. So January was kind of a slow shipment month. February was a much improved one and March was even more improved, getting a total for the 3 months, within 500,000 of the best first quarter we've ever had. Now because of the tightness of the marketplace, we were not doing very much in pricing last year at the end of last year as far as raising prices because we didn't want to -- we were having a hard time, basically, getting enough volume to keep everything the way we wanted it to do. And we didn't want to endanger with the price increase. However, once the orders started flowing well in January, we started increasing prices. It did not seem to have a noticeable effect on the price -- on what went in, but we were making marginal small price increases in a number of different areas that we felt we can do that. And it did not slow orders down appreciably. So as we came through the quarter, we came out of it with a very nice backlog right up among the best backlogs we've ever had at any time in the year. And we ended up having it at the end of the first quarter, which is quite unusual. So with that all looks very good day on. Now looking around and trying to figure out what was happening and trying to be able to define it so we understood it ourselves, as well as being able to tell you what we think went on. We've looked at what happened in the 2 areas I've mentioned, the one which is the replacement market which did not do very much the last half of last year because they had to have a product in and installed in order to qualify for the 100% depreciation. However, this year has a 50% depreciation and we believe that there was some people who could not move fast enough to get the equipment ordered and produced and shipped and installed last year since the bill was not passed until December 17, 2010. And therefore, there was not a lot of time to take action. We believe that there's some of those people who decided to move forward and go ahead and let it come into this year because there's still a 50% depreciation allowance, instant depreciation allowance. So we believe there's some -- even though there were some sucked out of this year because of the 100% last year, we think it might be being offset by the fact that 50% is in there this year. So that being said, we're of the opinion that the replacement market has kind of normalized because anything that went forward last year has been offset by something that's being bought this year, which wouldn't be bought if it weren't for the 50% thing. If I look at the new construction and going into Architectural Billings Index, I find that they've upgraded their graphics and made it much easier to discern what has been taking place. And according to their analysis and one I would believe in, they're billing index precedes the actual spending on a building by some 9 to 12 months. So in order to see what's happening today, you drop back somewhere between 9 and 12 months and you can see in the Architectural Billings Index whether it was a growth market as for as how much work the architecture are doing or whether it was declining market. And if I look at last year, from, say, March through the end of October, with one very small exception, it was a declining market throughout that entire time period. On an average of I tried to average the graph, they give us, I would say, it was a 2% to 3% decline month- over-month throughout the time interval. It past over at the end of October into the positive arena and has stayed positive since March -- or October of last year through till March 12 of this year, which is the latest date on the graph, but it has been something less than 1% positive. So if you look at that and you wash that through the negative 2% or 3% that was in right now, but going into a positive less than 1%, then the total is negative. So the industry from statistics doesn't look very bright. But then let's take a look at one other place to see what is actually happening in the arena of what we're doing on the types of buildings that we're involved in and for that we go to one put out by Census Bureau. It shows what the bookings or the actual dollars spent by month are, our year-to-date compared to a year ago. And we find a little more positive image at that point. For instance, the only one in the negative column there is at this point in time, which March is again the most recent thing that they give us was religious buildings, which were negative 8.2. The others were in the low-single digits for the most part with the exception of commercial space, which was 11.5% improvement from a year ago. And the most notable one in the improvement area, which portends well, is manufacturing was up 42.5%. So that would explain for whatever reason that discrepancy is to the Architects Billing Index or apparently a small discrepancy there. It would explain some of the growth that we're seeing. However, it doesn't explain the totality of it because we have had substantially more growth than that. So the only other thing to which we can attribute that is the improved relationship that we have created with our customers, both through the new products, which we brought out that had been well-received, as well as all the other things, which make up a relationship between a supplier and the customer. And we apparently are doing a better job across-the-board and that, basically, what's going on. That is good sign, very good sign from our perspective because it says we're not totally connected to what's going on in our industry. We're rising above what's happening to the industry to some degree. And so we believe that there's nothing that we're doing at the present time to change that course of direction. So we're anticipating that, that will stay with us for a long time to come far beyond this year and, therefore, will give us a better year. Consequently, we're pretty optimistic much more so as I said in my news release that -- about the middle of the news release, I said that the new products, improved manufacturing equipment and facilities would give us more advantageous, as well as the improvement we have gotten from training and in some cases, replacing our sales outlets and trying to improve our responsiveness to our customers in our communications and in all other areas. So at this point in time, we're pretty confident that, that's going forward. We also are sitting at this point, as I mentioned, with a $58.7 million backlog at the end of March. You say, well, how is that going on since that point? And I will tell you that it is larger now than it was at that point in time. So things are looking positive. We are hiring personnel. We're gearing up for higher level of sales and of course, while we're doing that, we've been implementing some price increases at both of our facilities on virtually all of our product line. However, there's a bad side to that because with this $58 million backlog we had at the end of March before the price increases that weren't already built into that a little bit earlier, in other words, some of that market -- some of that $58 million have some price increase in it, some of it did not. That which did not, of course, has to be produced in order to get us into some of the better priced products. And that has been occurring and additional price increases have gone in since the end of March. So the net result is that we are improving our selling price, which will relate to bottom line as it gets moved through the system. We don't -- just because the backlog is moving, we don't immediately realized that on the bottom line for a whole host of reasons, one of which to start out with a lot of the customers that give us an order who don't want it for some period of time. But also, we don't have the capability to instantaneously turn it around and ship it because we do not have it built in stock. We build to order and, therefore, we have to build the product. Therefore, we will be accelerating our sales throughout this quarter and the second quarter will just definitely be an upswing over the first quarter because we already have all the backlog and all the dollars we're going to shipped are already in the backlog. So we know where the orders are. And we're building up a nice reserve of orders for the third quarter and it has a promising look at this point as well. So I would say that we're optimistic about the balance of the year. Not because we think the marketplace is going to be good, we do not believe that. We believe it will be mediocre at best. It will probably be a little better than going negative, but it's not going to be very positive for many things that we can see. Because if you don't design -- if the architects don’t design buildings, there's no building going to be built for the most part. Now there are some exceptions but percentage-wise, it's pretty small and if the architects are not designing in 9 to 12 months before you expect to see them on the bottom line, they're not going to be there. And so right now, we're basically far enough along that we can look at the Architects Billing Index and we can see what the rest of this year is likely to be on new buildings and since it only turned positive in the end of October of last year, if you go by the 12-month thing, that says that we won't be getting anything out there until October, November of this year to make additional volume possible. And if you back it off 3 months, that's the most optimistic. So it will only been in the fourth quarter or in the very late part of the third quarter that any improved volume might even begin to appear. And since it's only a little, not even 1%, it's not going to be dramatic. So everything that we have to look at has to do with either replacement market or taking market share. And of those 2, we believe that the taking of the market share is where our ballgame is going to be played. And consequently, we're going to give you pretty optimistic view of what's going on in that arena. Now one of the things, which we've been doing for the past several years has been building buildings, buying machinery and redesigning equipment. The vast bulk of our dollars are coming all from equipment that has been recently redesigned and the smaller part, which is on the products, which haven't been recently redesigned are in the process of being redesigned now. But the impact they will have on the short-term even after they are out there is less than the ones which we have just done because the volume isn't high. But it will give us, going forward, an entirely new product line for both the Longview and the Tulsa facility and they have been being received very well by the customers. They are obviously pleased with what we're doing as is evidenced by our upswing in orders. So that's kind of the picture that we see and hear at this point in time. We have no big issues out there that we're aware of. We, as far as our marketing of the product, we know no issues out there, we know no big warranty issues. We've stumbled a little bit internally on our internal reporting systems and we will be noting that. But it's not a consequence and it has not had and will not have any big effect on us and we have it resolved. We had a mistake made in a way that required that we notify you of it, which we will do. But it was not one that is going to have any long-term nor -- or very much short-term effect on us. So that being said, I'd like to open the conversation for questions now. If we may have them."
77,GV_021542_2013Q1,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Karla, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the first quarter report conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce you to your host, Mr. Asbjornson. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. Welcome to AAON's First Quarter Report for the Year 2013. Before I go any further, I'd like to read the forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q. And now I would like to introduce Scott Asbjornson, who is our CFO, and will take over the call for a while. Scott M. Asbjornson VP of Finance & CFO Welcome, everyone. In addition to myself and Norm, we also have attending this conference call our new Chief Accounting Officer, Rebecca Thompson. I'll start off going over the comparative results of the 3 months ended March 31, 2013 to March 31, 2012. Revenues were up 2.9% to $66.8 million from $65 million. Revenues increased due to gains in market share in the nonresidential and replacement markets and as a result of price increases introduced in 2012. Gross profit increased 13.3% to $15.3 million from $13.5 million. As a percentage of sales, gross profits were 22.9% in the quarter just ended compared to 20.8% in 2012. The improvement in gross profits can be attributed to changes in pricing with a comparatively stable cost structure. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.5% to $7 million from $6 million in 2012. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 10.4% of total sales in the quarter just ended and 9.2% in 2012. The increase in SG&A is primarily due to hiring of new employees, increased advertising expense related to a sales show, increased professional fees to our external auditors and other consultants and increases in employee compensation. Operating income increased 10.3% to $8.3 million or 12.5% of sales from $7.6 million or 11.6% of sales. Our effective tax rate decreased from 39.9% to 14.6%, largely due to an Oklahoma investment credit and changes in federal tax laws. We expect the rate for the remaining quarters of 2013 to be approximately 34.5%. Net income increased 56.3% to $7.1 million or 10.7% of sales from $4.6 million or 7% of sales. Diluted earnings per share increased by 61.1% to $0.29 per share from $0.18 per share. Diluted earnings per share were based on 24,641,000 shares versus 24,772,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that we had a working capital balance of $61.4 million. Cash and investments increased $6.7 million to a total of $26 million during the quarter. The investments have maturities ranging from 2 months to 2 years. Our current asset ratio was approximately 2.8:1. Our capital expenditures were approximately $997,000. Shareholders' equity per share is $5.92. We paid no dividends in the first quarter compared with cash dividends of $5.8 million in December 2012. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with the new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you. Despite a difficult environment in the big commercial and industrial building market, sales were up 2.9% for the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2012. Sales increased due to our ability to gain market share, plus a small price increase during the year of 2012. We have also been redesigning products and attacking different market segments. The market is also broken down between replacement and new construction. At the present time, we have a continuation of what has occurred in the past couple of years of the replacement market becoming dominant in our environment. It might be noted here that in the market as a whole, replacement market probably has been dominant over new construction for a few years. But in our case, we used to be more heavily into the new construction than replacement market. At the present time, we believe our replacement market share, the market percentage of our total is approximately 55%, with 45% under new construction. We had, in the past, a significant upturn in the geothermal market, which we participate in, in a little different matter than most people assume in the geothermal. The geothermal market typically is dominated by a very standardized product, typically in the 2 tons through to 5 tons in capacity size. The manner in which we attack the geothermal market is through condensing units for air handling units, larger package units set up to do variable air volume and rooftop units in all of their configurations. So geothermal market means a little different to us than it does to the rest of the geothermal market. The net result of the geothermal market, however, in total has been negatively affected by the decrease in natural gas cost, which has made natural gas more financially attractive means of heating, and not on the cooling but on the heating side. Chillers and air handlers, which we have entered into after our original beginning in strictly the rooftops, has continued to grow substantially, and we continue to grow into it, primarily in the replacement market. It, however, still is a small part of our business. A similar situation on air handling units, along with condensing units, it has grown in force and we're into the market more all the time but now we're still not in the primary market. The other system, which we have brought out of recent has been what is called the 4x4 unit, which has been designed primarily for the very high-rise buildings, multi-story buildings, all the way up to 50, 100 stories, whatever. And in that realm we've had a fairly sizable increase in our share of the market. But that particular market has not been flourishing very much in new construction, and therefore, most of what we're getting in that market has been in the replacement area. The large growth that we've been experiencing continues -- in total dollars continues to be our dominant market, which is our rooftop market. We continue to gain market share pretty much uniformly across the board on all unit sizes. However, particular attention should be paid, perhaps, to a very large market segment, which we participate in to a degree in the commercial side but which also is in the residential market. And that is the 2- to 5-ton rooftop product, which is also applied as a -- outside ground mounted unit in some installations residentially. So it's not a clean commercial market. However, it has been one which we, up until recently, did not participate very much in and we still do not participate in large percentage. But it is our fastest growing percentage of our rooftop ""product line."" To give you an idea of how all that goes up, we'll just talk about the 2- to 5-ton market and what it is as a percent of our market for a moment. In the market as a whole, the 2- to 5-ton product line is approximately, at this point in time, about -- 200 -- excuse me, for the year 2011, was about 213% greater than the larger units. In other words, 6-ton and up, we're -- 213% is the amount they were less than the 2 to 5. In our case, our 2 to 5 was smaller, and it only represented 21% -- 21.7% of our market in 2011. However, looking at our growth pattern in that, and I bring this up because we're very, very small part of the market. We're less than 1% of the market. But between 2011, for the numbers I just quoted you, in 2012, we made a 22.9% gain in unit sales in that market. In the year between 2012 and 2013, when the -- we got the full advantage of the new product we introduced during 2011 to go after that market more seriously. Our growth in our portion of that market was 53.7%. So while we're still down under the 1%, our percentage of growth is increasing. And as can be seen by previous numbers, that market is substantially larger in units than is the market above 5 tons. In dollars, it varies, depending upon what numbers you want to believe, but a 2- to 5-ton market in dollars approach is, if not, is 1/2 of the market share, of all rooftop sales. So starting to make a definite impact in that market with the product we introduced in 2011 is a very positive sign for the company's future. Let's talk a little bit about what's happening in various market parameters. The -- overall, in the private market segment, the private market segment has had a modest amount of the improvement. The public market share, however, has not. It has been having difficulties, as one could imagine, considering the financial health of the various governmental units. The particular ones within those, however, now the commercial has -- the commercial and retail part has probably had a fairly strong increase, primarily because of the replacement market in that area. Now the office building is also showing some signs of health. Medical and health care is definitely one of the healthier situations. Education is, like I spoke earlier, suffering from financial problems within governmental units. Manufacturing had a large upswing for a period of time earlier and has seemed to have slowed down from where it looked like it was very promising 90 days ago. Lodging, we don't very much participate in, so it's not a real meaningful thing to us. Our backlog did have a substantial upswing. At March 31, our backlog was $71,731,292 compared to $58,695,211 a year ago. So now that's a good favorable thing going into the second, third quarter. Incoming order rate has continued to be strong and the gross profit went up from 2012 at 20.8% up to 22.9% in 2013. As was mentioned earlier, our SG&A was up. I would like to emphasize 2 of the things which are definitely not going to be reoccurring. We had a national sales meeting in which we spent considerable money and had an open house for our certain select invited customers at this, and this open house was held down in Texas during the ASHRAE show in January. And we had approximately 3,000 customers show up at the event to view the product we were showing there. So it was a substantial investment, which will not be ongoing until a year from now. We'll have another one some place at that point in time. In addition to which, there were bonuses handed out to people in the company that were for the entire year, and they, of course, will not be repeated in the next 3 months -- or 3 months or 6 or 9 months. So the SG&A will fall back to the more 9% area. Net income for the year was -- or quarter was up 56.3%, primarily due to not only having a good quarter but also due to 2 things, which were mentioned earlier, relative to change in tax law, which gave us a tax benefit on income from 2012 and also plus that we're given reduction on this in the state of Oklahoma. The remainder of 2013 is at this point, to the best of our ability to see forward, looking to be stable to slightly improved in the economic situation in the commercial building industry. Now that does not mean that we're adhering to that same philosophy. We continue to believe that we will outgrow any growth which might occur during the balance of the year, and the amount we're able to outgrow stable to slightly improve the market is questionable. But we feel very comfortable with all the new products we have, with the new salespeople we put on; with these new salespeople that many, many of our salespeople have employed over the past few months; and the changes which we've made in the company; and in addition to, of course, the good backlog we have and the good profitability we have. Capital expenditures for the year, as you'd note, were under $1 million for the first quarter. Now we have projected that they would be in the $8 million to $10 million for the year. And that's still a reasonable expectation for the balance of the year. We do intend to start in doing some work on another portion of the building, a small portion in the $2 million to $3 million range. Other than that, no other major capital that we've committed to at this point in time or plan on committing to. So it is possible we won't spend the $8 million or $10 million. Now for the balance of the year, just as I said, stable to slightly improving and AAON's percent market growth should continue as it has for -- better than 20 years to be taking market share out of it. I now open it up to questions."

Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Again thank you and I will turn it over to Kathy Sheffield our Vice President and in charge of finance. Thank you. Kathy Sheffield Good Afternoon and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I’d like to begin today by discussing the operating results for the three months ended June 30 compared to the three months ended June 30 2007. Revenues were up 6% to $74.8 million from $70.8 million. The increase in the sales was attributable to an increase in our volume, our diversified product mix, an excellent response to many of our new and redesigned products and also to price increases. Gross profit increased 15% to $18 million or 24.1% of sales from $15.6 million or 22% of sales. The increase in the gross profit was a result of higher sales, our price increases and also production in labor efficiencies. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the second quarter by 15% or $6.1 million or 8.2% of sales from $5.3 million or 7.4% of sales. The increase in the SG&A was primarily related to an increase in selling related expenses, warranty expense related to the higher increase sales; profit sharing, that’s also related to increased net income and an overall increase in general and administrative expenses. Our operating income increased 15% to $11.9 million compared to 15.9% of sales from $10.3 million or 14.6% of sales. Net income increased to $7.8 million or 10.4% of sales from $6.9 million or 9.7% of sales. The increase in the net income resulted from our higher sales volumes and improved productivity. Our diluted EPS was $0.43 per share versus $0.36 per share compared to the same quarter last year. Our earnings per share for the three months were based 18,145,000 shares compared to 19,336,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. Moving now to the six months results revenues were up 8% to $140.2 million from $129.5 million. Gross profit increased 7% to $33.6 million or 24% of sales from $31.3 million or 24.2% of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the six months by 9% to $12 million or 8.6% of sales from $11 million or 8.5% of sales. Operating income increased 6% to $21.6 million or 15.4% of sales from $20.3 million or 15.7% of sales. Net income increased to $14.2 million or 10.1% of sales from $13.2 million or 10.2% of sales. The diluted EPS was $0.78 per share versus $0.69 per share a year ago. Earnings per share for the six months were based on 18,302,000 shares compared to 19,492,000 shares. Looking at the balance sheet we see that the company’s current asset ratio is approximately 1.7, that was due primarily to our dividends payable, our higher accrued liabilities and part of the higher accrued liabilities were based increased warranty expenses, accrual and our commission. Capital expenditures for the six months were $1.4 million of the expenses related to new equipment and also office renovation in the Tulsa location. Share holders equity per share as of June 30 was $5.23 compared to $5.29 last year. We also pay cash dividends of $2.9 million and also back stock at the amount of $17.3 million. I would now like to turn the call back to Norm who will discuss our results in further detail along with our new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year; Norm. Norman Asbjornson We are very pleased with the sales performance we’ve had. The economy is a little bit soft in the commercial end. It has been for most of the year and doesn’t have any defined direction at this point whether it’s going to get stronger or not, but it appears that it’s pretty stable at this point. The energy issue has become more and more important and we have done a lot of things to address energy in a positive fashion and it’s helped our sales effort. Probably the one that is more changed than anything though is because of Montreal Protocol which the U.S. is adhering to and the things out of our older type of refrigerant by the first of January 2010 and with a new more environmentally friendly refrigerant called our 410. There’s been a dramatic switch over to 410 by all our customer base and so there has been a bolt of benefit and the problem here the benefit being that we were totally ready for it and therefore probably got some sales because we were ready for it. The negative being of course it’s a massive change in engineering on every product we use as refrigerant not because we haven’t done the engineering, we have but it’s just the conversion from largely using one kind of refrigerant to largely using the other and the change in some of the componentry that had to change to make that happen. So we are very pleased that it has pretty much happened in AAON and we are rapidly getting to a point where only our 410 refrigerant is being bought by our customers. We continue to have growth in some of our new product offerings, some of those are in the split system market out of our Long due facility, air handlers and condensing units as well as increasing the chillers made up in Tulsa added considerably to it. We’ve been talking about the residential issue for sometime and we are into selling that now on a very modest scale and the reason for that is the residential market is under severe stress as you are no doubt aware of and therefore it is not a good time to go in there and do a lot of work to try and get what business there is there and we are better spending our time in the commercial market which is a much more healthy market place. There’s been a definite decided change in the product that we’re selling to some of those new products and also going into some of our larger tonnage products and diminishing a little bit in our smaller tonnage products and that’s primarily due to being a soft market. The competition is very strong at this point in time, but also the new things which we’ve been introducing have been into our new larger tonnage equipment and they are defiantly technologically advanced products more so than the industry is and so it’s been a more appealing part of our product line. We are at this point in time moving that technology down and we are in the present process as we speak of going into about another 20% of our business with some of these more technology, which will mean that once we get there which will happen by October we would have gone from somewhere around 40% of our market being with basically foam construction and direct drive blowers is the main two things which effect both our roof tops and our air handlers. Roof tops are just in the two larger sizes right now. The third size is presently being introduced into the market place, which when it’s into the market place we’ll be shipping in October. We will at that point somewhere around 60% of our dollars will be with newer products and so we are progressing very well in that area. Our backlog at this point in time, at the end of June was $67,110,000 which is about $10 million less that it was a year ago. The primary reason for being about $10 million less that a year ago is the fact that as I spoke earlier, the market has not been real strong, but the more defined answer to why we are sitting where we are is the fact that our capability of building product has improved considerably from a year ago and so we’ve been able to ship our product more when the customer wants it and therefore diminish our back log by shipping more when the customer wants it. To give you a feel of how much that has changed; during the month of June we shipped a little bit over $30 millions which annualized of course will be $360 million plus and if we had pushed it a little bit, we could have probably made it annualized at $400 million. So our capacity is as we’ve been speaking for a long time in improving and with all the new product we’re hoping that we will be able to utilize more fully all that capacity. In order to do that $30 million in June, we did not have to run a lot of overtime and we did basically without a lot more people than we’ve been doing say a year ago due to the improved productivity of the company. Our productivity has been enhanced considerably over the past year somewhat by the new equipment and others just by learning how to help people better and people learning what they’re doing more than they did before. As was noted in Kathy’s talk, a lot of things were up and down a little bit in the margin area and the sales and the price increases. A reasonable amount of that increased sales of course was due to the price increases that we put out, but the other part of it probably was primarily due to the productivity increase. We probably didn’t increase our prices as fast as what our material costs were because they have been coming pretty strong and they are continuing; in fact they appear to be moving up, accelerated at this point in time. We have been notified of price increases on significant components that we buy of up to 15% to occur yet this year. So it’s a very inflationary environment that our industry is living in and what effect that will have upon future sales one doesn’t know, we are in an inflationary environment. The SG&A expenses basically as you can see were running along at the 8.2% for the last three months and 8.6% for the six months. We see that running somewhere between 8.5% and 9% for the remainder of the year, so no significant change in that area. Operating margins were 15.9 for the quarter and 15.4 for the year. Net income was up 8% to 14.2% compared to 13.2% last year. The CapEx was only about 1.4 so far and we are still sticking with somewhere in the $7 million to $10 million for equipment and the Tulsa building expansion. The building is just beginning to come out of the ground now, so it’s just beginning to start using a lot of money to pay for building. Anyhow when it’s competed it’ll further improve our productivity and obviously give us more future capacity that even we have at the present time. The one other question that come up is, what about is happening to the Canadian facility? And as we spoke the last time we have raised the price considerably for all business we did in the United States due to the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar changing very substantially in the latter part of last year and that of course raised our price to our U.S. customers by a considerable margin and in addition to that we raised it enough so that we should have a change to make some money up there which we weren’t making and the net result is a great drop off of U.S. orders which was the majority of our business. The net result is that we’re down to producing approximately one third of what we were seeing a little over a year ago and we’ve diminished the size of the operation accordingly. We were real close to breaking even at it, but the jury is still out as to whether we’ll be able to make any money there, where we’re going. It does seem to be stabilized at about this much and it does seem that we’re getting orders at about this levels, so the longer that occurs the more likely it is that we are going to be able to get the thing of making money, but that’s not for certain. New products and everything, we’ve talked about a little bit. On the big issues is on the energy issue. We’re doing a lot of things which are quite new to the industry and quit effective on improving efficiency. We have some test jobs out that look like they’ve improved our energy efficiency and some new technology by somewhere up to may be 20%. We’re still analyzing our position on that and making sure that what we believe is happening, is truly what is happening. If look at our business segments, retail is pretty soft, office buildings are not too bad, medical heath care is pretty good, education is quite strong, manufacturing is probably so-so and other is going along pretty well. No real signs of any increase or decrees in those at this moment in time. The outlook for the stock purchasing program is that starting Friday we will be back in the market again. We now are down out of that initial 1,800,000 shares roughly that we have authorized in November of last year. We have remaining to be purchased about 330, 000 shares out of that. The biggest concern I have at this point was pointed out on the front page of the Wall Street journal on August 1, last Friday. There was a big article headlined relative to Wal-Mart and warnings they have about a bill which had past Congress but had not gotten through the Senate last year, Wal-Mart called Employee Free Choice Act which would make it possible for unions to unionized by simply getting in 50% of the individuals to sign a card and never have a secrete ballet which almost assures that if that passes and according to what Senate Obama is saying that he will do is that he will have that passed within the first 100 days of his administration. If that is going to occur, that’s going to effectively unionized the United States all the way down to very small companies and I have real (inaudible) about where that’s all going, because the history of unionization compared to the world economy has been very bad in the past 15 years in the United States, were we’ve been heavily unionized in whatever industry it seems to have moved offshore, so that is by far my biggest concern with the future everything else is quite manageable. With that I will turn it over to you for questions-and-answers."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to this morning's conference call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Asbjornson, you may now begin your conference. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good morning. Norman Asbjornson here on our second quarter results for AAON. Before going forward, I'd like to read our disclaimer. To the extent that any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward- looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Thank you. And I'd like to introduce our CFO, Kathy Sheffield. Kathy? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good morning. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call, too. I'd like to begin by discussing the results of the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to June 30, 2009. Revenues were down 6% to $64.5 million from $68.6 million, as we continue to be affected by the current economic environment. Gross profit decreased 14.4% to $15.5 million from $18.1 million. Gross profit was 24% of sales during 2010 compared to 26.4% of sales during 2009. The gross margin percentages decreased due to several factors, lower sales, high raw material costs and a onetime charge related to expenses associated with the moving of one of our production lines from our East manufacturing facility to our West manufacturing facility, and also setting up additional production lines in the new Tulsa West building addition. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 2.9% to $6.6 million or 10.2% of sales from $6.8 million or 9.9% of sales. The decrease is primarily due to a lower bad debt expense to reduce the bad debt reserve, a decrease in sales related expenses and also a decrease in profit sharing due to the lower net income. Operating income decreased 21.2% to $8.9 million or 14.8% of sales from $11.3 million or 16.5% of sales. Net income decreased 18% to $5.8 million or 9% of sales from $7.1 million or 10.3% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.34 per share versus $0.41 per share a year ago. Earnings per share were based on 17,030,000 shares compared to 17,315,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. The results of the six months, where revenues were down 14.2% to $113.8 million from $132.6 million. Gross profit decreased 18.6% to $28.5 million from $35 million. Gross profit was 25% for the first six months of 2010 compared to 26.4% in 2009. Selling, general, administrative expenses decreased 14.3% to $11.4 million or 10% of sales from $13.3 million or 10% of sales. Operating income decreased 21.2% to $17.1 million or 15% of sales from $21.7 million or 16.4% of sales. Net income decreased 21% to $10.9 million or 9.6% of sales from $13.8 million or 10.4% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.64 per share versus $0.80 per share for the year-to- date calculation. EPS were based on 17,150,000 shares versus 17,325,000 shares. Moving to the balance sheet, that we still continue to have a strong liquidity position of $4.1 million in cash, which continues to aid our goal to stay as liquid as possible during today's uncertain economic times. Our current ratio, asset ratio is 2:1 and capital expenditures were $6.5 million primarily for equipment purchases to set up manufacturing lines for the Tulsa building addition. Shareholders equity per share is $6.65 compared to $6.85 for 2009 due to the repurchase of company stock. We paid cash dividends of $3.1 million in January of 2010 and declared dividends of $3.1 million in June. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail along with new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you, Kathy. As reported, it's not a real bright first half of the year. However, there is a bright side to it, namely the fact that while our market is down somewhere in the 20% area, our sales are down less than that indicating we've had an additional market share of what was available to us. We also, even though we did not get a price increase, have not had one since 2008, we have been able to offset largely the cost increases, which have occurred over the past two years through increased productivity as well as a little bit of cost reduction in some of the new products that we've come out with. The new products have been very well received and it's noticeable that the first ones were brought out in the fall of 2008 versus the next group that came out in the fall of 2009 and the others that have come out either in the spring of this year or the beginning of summer of this year have each one has started growing from what we would've anticipated. But the biggest growth is in the one that was out there the longest indicating it's been in the marketplace and the customers have looked at it, like what they have seen and given us a disproportionate increase in sales of that particular product. We, therefore, anticipate that as time goes on, these other products, which would have been subsequently introduced as mentioned, will start finding a similar acceptance and gain market share for us due to the advanced technologies and energy-saving features that these products contain. So to staying on course during all this time of investment in R&D and new products, we believe this is being very fruitful for us and we're seeing the success of all that as we go forward. Kathy mentioned that we did move one of our product lines from the East facility here in Tulsa to the West facility, and that has given us, obviously, a cost associated with it. We did not miss any production. We met all our customer ship dates but it did cost us some overtime and it cost us a lot of other things associated with the move. It immediately did not start paying off because it was a new production line and had to have the bugs worked out on it. It's much longer, much more volume capable line than we have before and, therefore, we had a little bit of a startup issue with it. We have, however, since the move passed that point and we are now running at more productivity on that line than we were in the East facility. And we anticipate further improvement as we make additional adjustments to our methods that are available to us with this new product and new production line. We did also, in the West facility, extend two other production lines making them longer and spent some money doing that and disrupted our production a little bit. Again, not that we've missed the ship dates but we did have additional time spent to make those changes. So the West facility at the present time has three production lines in it, all pretty much redone and the method that we anticipate they being for several years to come. We do have additional production facilities to be installed in the West facility as future time allots and requires. This facility where we moved the product out of there to move it over to the West facility made available some space, which we’ve put our newest product into production on and it, like the ones on the West side is a very long line for the unit and will allow us to have considerable volume increase as years go forward on all of those production lines. We still have two production lines operating on the East facility, which in the future will have to be revamped to give us additional capacity there for future years. But that is not a necessity in the immediate future due to the economic conditions we're living in. But we are continuing to resolve a number of issues that allows productivity improvement in the company in Tulsa. We have likewise in the Longview facility made some adjustments down there. We're making some additional adjustments down there at the present time. We have not been introducing here in the most recent few months new products but we did last year and in preceding years introduced several new products down there, all of which are growing very nicely for us. And it's one of the highlights of our company in that, contrary to what has happened to us in the Tulsa facility, the Longview facility, while it's much smaller volume in sales has actually increased in sales for this year compared to last year. And so there are issues in the Longview facilities are related to increasing capability to produce the product that they're getting orders for. And most of that is related to personnel problems and various system problems of how we do things that we are working on to correct. We anticipate the Longview facility because it has grown from last year to this year in new orders. We anticipate that to continue as the acceptability of those products becomes greater out in the marketplace. So we have the typical bad news, good news. The bad news, we all know about the economy and how it is not doing anything really well for the building industry yet, in the commercial building industry precisely. On one positive side, there has been a modest improvement in the residential building and the old cliché in our industry is that, somewhere six months to a year or whatever number you want to use after residential starts up or goes down, commercial follows. And that is a logical thing, when you consider that most of the buildings we build are supportive structures for residential areas such as schools, retail establishments, offices and things of that nature. The only one or the major ones that aren't related to housing starts probably would be manufacturing facilities. So there are a few bright lights but there's an awful lot of questions in the building industry right now, as you can read in the financial papers. Some of the various things that are bothering the commercial markets, commercial building markets. We, however, have chosen to be cautious and make certain that we don't use up our liquidity position but at the same time, not stop moving forward and as mentioned, we have been moving forward in the facilities and in the new products. And we will continue to do so. We have additional equipment on order. We have also been buying back stock as, you can note in our financials. So we are moving forward cautiously and positioning ourselves, so that as the economy turns positive, we will be in a position to take maximum advantage of that upturn. We, however, are being cautious, so that if there is further difficulty in the economy, we have not expended all of our resources and we have the ability to hopefully contend with any additional problems which may occur. I don't have a whole lot more to add to that, so I'll open it for questions and answers at this point in time and see what questions you might have."
80,GV_021542_2011Q2,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon. My name is Carla, and I'm going to be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter and first half AAON Inc. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Asbjornson, you may now begin your conference. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to AAON's second quarter and first half announcement of results and discussion of same. But before going any further, I'd like to read the forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. I would like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our Chief Financial Officer. Kathy? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Thank you, Norm. Good afternoon. Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin today by discussing comparative results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2011, with June 30, 2010. Revenues were up 7% to $69.1 million from $64.5 million. Our revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in sales to the replacement market and the favorable reception to our new products. Gross profit decreased 24.3% to $11.7 million from $15.5 million. Gross profit was 17% of sales compared to 24% of sales. The gross profit percentage has decreased due to a number of factors which include excess manufacturing supplies, that we purchased in advance to avoid price increases; higher cost of raw material and component parts, which we were unable to pass on to our customers in the form of a price increase; lower productivity of workers and equipment caused by an adverse temperature condition resulting from previously reported storm damage to the roof of our Tulsa facility; and also to the manufacturing problems related to productions facility's rearrangement. And Norm will be happy to address this subject in greater detail in his part of the discussion. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 13.7% to $5.7 million or 8.2% of sales from $6.6 million or 10.2% of sales. The decrease was primarily due to lower warranty and selling-related expenses. Our operating income decreased 32.2% to $6 million or 8.8% of sales from $8.9 million or 13.8% of sales. Net income decreased 34% to $3.8 million or 5.6% of sales from $5.8 million or 9% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.15 per share versus $0.23 per share a year ago. Earnings per share were based on 24,923,000 shares versus 25,546,000 shares. All the diluted earnings per share and the share count information that we discuss today are reflective of the 3 for 2 stock split that was effective June 13 of this year. The results of the 6 months, takes us to revenues going up 13.3% to $129 million from $113.8 million. Gross profit decreased 18% to $23.4 million from $28.5 million. Gross profit was 18.1% of sales compared to 25% of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.6% to $11.2 million or 8.7% of sales from $11.4 million or 10% of sales. Operating income decreased 28.9% to $12.1 million or 9.4% of sales from $17.1 million or 15% of sales. Net income decreased 31.5% to $7.5 million or 5.8% of sales from $10.9 million or 9.6% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.30 per share versus $0.43 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,931,000 shares versus 25,725,000 shares. As we move to the balance sheet, we see that we continue to have a strong balance sheet with $240,000 invested in certificates of deposit, $2.3 million of current assets in corporate notes and bonds and no long- term debt. Our current ratio was 1.7:1, which was affected by an increase in inventories of $11.8 million due to purchasing additional inventory to avoid impending price increases and capital expenditures of $25.6 million. Shareholders’ equity per share is $4.87 compared to $4.72 a year ago. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with our new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you, Kathy. We've had a highly unusual quarter and a highly unusual first half of the year. And before going into AAON's part of it, I would like to discuss the general market condition a little bit so you kind of know what the market is that we're seeing. The market has been -- the new construction market has been in a long-term decline ever since hitting a high, back in 2007, December of 2007. Well, actually it went into early 2008 before it actually started the decline, which began in August 2008. And we are now seeing the beginning of an upturn, which according to NAAHL, all the nonresidential construction began in February of this month -- of this year. However, that is somewhat misleading because it has roads and water systems and various other things in it, which are not part of our world. If I look at the portion which is our world and go down through it, I find that the lodging has made a turn, slight turn from May to June, and all of my data here, the most recent I have available to look at is June. I find that offices have also gone up from May to June, as have commercial buildings. There, it's basically flat. Commercial buildings went flat in that time. Healthcare went up slightly. Educational went up a little bit there, and religious was still down -- excuse me, educational stayed down in that month. So since educational is almost twice as large a market as any one of the others I mentioned and then I add in there manufacturing, which was up substantially, about 4% between those 2 months -- $4 million, I should say. It gives you the picture that finally we've reached the bottom in the building construction market somewhere in the May, June, July timeframe, and hopefully, it will continue to move upward. However, comparing those results to the previous year, you'd find that lodging is down considerable, as is office is down considerable. Commercial is down considerable. Healthcare is slightly up from a year ago. Educational is also down for the year -- comparison year. So in total, compared to a year ago, we're down but we've made the turn on new construction. However, that's not the real story to be told in our industry. The real story has to do with what has happened in the replacement market. The replacement market started turning in early this year, and then turned significantly as the year went on. I believe the majority of the credit for that, those have do with one of the few successful programs in my opinion that the federal government implemented, which was the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010 as signed into law on December 17 of last year. That seems to be the trigger that really triggered the replacement market. And the net result of that, all that, has been when looking at AHRI, which are our industry statistics, telling us what has happened by unit size, growth or not, the market in total has, through the most recent reporting time, which was May, had improved from a year ago by 8%. And that can only be attributable to replacement market, and I think a lot of that was attributable to that act I read, which allowed 100% depreciation for certain qualified capital expenditures. And I believe a lot of the air-conditioning qualified for some people, and they used that. That being said, we finally are seeing a situation, at least in the statistics that are present at this time, of a possible turn in new construction and a fairly healthy replacement market giving us in total a nice growth. All right, that being said, now let's go into AAON and how that affected us and what we're seeing in our world. The first thing I would like to tell you is that thus far this year, we have booked 19% more business than we had in the similar period a year ago. We also have gone up in our backlog through the second quarter by 35%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. Now those are the 2 very positive things. The third positive thing is that the price increases which we have had, have been passed through and are in place and are largely represented in our backlog. So those are the good things. The other very good thing in my opinion and very hard to understand perhaps when you look at the numbers so it's very critical that what I tell you now is understood. We are in the process of one of the biggest revitalizations of a company that you could possibly go through. What do I mean by that? We have been introducing new products for the past 3 or 4 years, and they've been very well received by the marketplace. And they basically take into account the technological advances that are available now and put our product line in an excellent condition going forward. So the necessary cost of expenditure for reengineering product is largely behind us. Along that line, what our belief is, is that we have a significant growth potential if the economy cooperates at all. And toward that end, we have been building and been renovating and been restructuring the inside of the building. All of that has come at a cost to us, obviously. And when the act, which I've mentioned, allowing capitalization, 100% depreciation, was announced, we checked and a lot of our machinery qualified, a lot of our very old machinery that was pretty well worn out. And so we decided to embark, and we changed our capital investment procedures considerably following that announcement in December of last year, and we have purchased a lot of capitalized machinery since that time. To that extent, what we have done in that arena, we have put out about $25.9 million worth of capital goods, the majority of which is for new equipment and only a portion of it is for building, which is of course capitalized on a long-term depreciation schedule. Most all of that has already been paid for and is outside of our scope -- the scope of our business. The amount that is still remaining open in that arena is around $7 million to come out of it. However, along with that, one of the practices which we have had in this company since the beginning of the company has been whenever we can buy forward anything that will allow us to make money on the purchase, and by that I mean, if we, for instance, have somebody announce to us a 5% price increase and our cost to capital to prepurchase is less than that for the time element we're going to buy it for, in other words, if we were buying and our cost of capital was 5%, obviously one year's prepurchasing would negate any need to buy forward. So we might buy forward 3 or 4 months or 5 months, and that's the way in which we make these decisions. And also based upon cost of holding that beyond just the capitalized cost, the cost of our facility and everything, whatever we're using up. Well this year, the commodity costs have moderated compared to last year. But the pass-through of those commodity costs as they affect component costs are still being passed through, and they were rather significant. We have had price increases of up to 10% on some components, major components and possibly quite a bit more than that on some small ones. So we have been prepurchasing 2 types of things. One is the capitalized items such as you see in our inventory sheet, which is up considerable, approximately $12 million. That will largely be used up in this last half of the year. However, not totally because some of the things we purchased that were major items were up in that 8% and 10%, so we actually bought more than what we will need until sometime the early part of next year. So those will moderate. We will be liquidating our inventory and going back pretty close to where we were coming into the year by the end of this year. The other aspect that is not on our balance sheet and which is very significant, one which you must recognize to understand what has happened financially to us, has to do with expense items. Expense items are a whole variety of things, and I'll give you some examples. Wire, for instance, is an expense item. Straight copper, in other words the copper that we buy in straight lengths that we use to pipe up the machine is expensed. Paint is expensed. Foam is expensed. Refrigerant is expensed, and screws and bolts and the multitudinous other items. The net result of all of that is we have prepurchased, and it is not in our financial sheets, a lot of material which will be used up over the next few months, primarily, I think, almost entirely by the end of this year. That is a significant factor. It's almost -- it's up around $1.7 million, $1.8 million of excess inventory on purchase. I shouldn't use the word inventory because it's expensed items. And so that's not on our balance sheet, but it is in our control, and we will use it. And it will offset those costs for the next 6 months. And so that distorts our balance sheet somewhat. Now in going through some of the other items which are affecting us, besides that, we listed in our announcement that the excess costs because of what we prepurchased on expense items and the raw material and the component parts, those were, we believe, slightly less cost additions to us in the first 6 months, down around $1.6 million or $1.7 million, than was the expense items. The next ones, which are the lower productivity caused by adverse temperature conditions are extremely difficult to measure. And I won't try and give you a feel for it, but I'll tell you what has occurred. As we talked in the first quarter, we had a very unusual snowstorm here in the first week of February of this year, wherein in one week we received more snow than had ever been recorded in the history of Tulsa, Oklahoma in all preceding recorded history for an entire year, and we got it in one week. That plus the winds that came along with it overloaded our roofs and broke some very large holes in the roofs. And because of the structural nature of the roof, it's considerable effort to get those replaced, one of which has been fixed. The other one, a hole of about 130 by 140 is being repaired as we speak. But it has not been closed off. Therefore, in the winter, of course, we suffered from the cold, and this summer we suffered from the heat. We finally have gotten enough air conditioning running that even with the hole in the roof, it's not too bad inside the building. But back in the month of June, we did not get that air conditioning up and running. And so we had conditions inside the building of approximately 100 degrees, plus or minus, for most of the month of June. It was quite unexpected, quite unusual weather for Oklahoma but we had it. And the net result is some of our sheet metal equipment overheated, as well as the cost of the productivity slowdown from people having to work in that kind of a climate. And it had an immediate impact on us during June and slowed down the month. How much did it cost us in production, if I had just a rough guess on it? I think it probably cut back production $4 million to $5 million. The net result is, of course we lost the income associated with that, plus we lost the revenue that was associated there. So those are highly unusual aspects which have occurred to us. We don't anticipate any -- most any of them other than ongoing cost of the components and the raw material to be with us. Okay. Offsetting that, we have been buying a lot of -- I should say, we have been putting price increases in on all of our products at various times and various amounts for the past year. We are of the opinion that most of our backlog now, which is carrying all these price increases and has just started flowing through during the month of July in real big quantities, is going to bring our profitability back to a reasonable level compared to where we have been in the past. Precisely where, it is yet to be determined because so many price increases are folded in there, that are just starting to flow through that it is going to be difficult to tell until we actually see them flow through to know precisely. We know they're significant, very significant. That, coupled with the size of our backlog and the fact that we are booking new business at a very considerable rate, the increase of the 19% I mentioned earlier, gives me great hope for the future. As far as the significance of it we have one analyst who has a new estimate out, by a company by the name of Sidoti, and I have reviewed the new one, which I've just received. And I feel fairly comfortable with where they are for the balance of the year. That being said, the last thing I need to discuss has to do with our rearrangement of our plant, and the rearrangement of the plant is all intended to give us 2 benefits: one, an increased productivity; and two, an ability to handle considerably more volume. We are now approximately 1/2 of the way through the rearrangement of the facility. During the rest of this year, we will rearrange perhaps another 15% of the facility, and in future years, we will be doing the rearrangement of the balance of that 30-some percent of the facility. So the majority of the rearrangement is past for this year and will not be causing us the degree of problem it has. What this amounts to is we have been moving production lines around in the building to give them more productivity and longer lines which will allow us to build more product. We have also been rearranging our sheet metal department to utilize the facility better when we put the new machinery in there. And that is going to have a very, very significant impact upon our ability to produce product at a cost-effective manner. So a very lot of very positive things are happening. Very negative thing about the cost that it has incurred on us so far in the first half of this year. The good part is that most of that is behind us, and there's a lot of good backlog there that is priced higher than what we've been producing. So with that, I'm going to open it up for questions."
81,GV_021542_2012Q2,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome you to the AAON, Inc. Second Quarter Sales and Earnings Call. Mr. Asbjornson, you may begin your call. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for attending our call. Without -- going forward at this point in time, I need to go through the disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Thank you again. And I'd like to introduce you to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Sheffield, who will give us the first part of the report. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon. Welcome to our conference call. Thank you for joining us today for the review of AAON's financial performance for the second quarter and 6 months of 2012. Please note that in making comparisons today, it's important to remember that 25,000 square feet of our manufacturing facility roof did not fall in on this year. So I'd now like to begin by discussing the comparative results for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, compared to June 30, 2011. We're very pleased to announce that our revenues were up 21% to $83.3 million from $69.1 million. Revenues increased primarily as a result in gains and market share and new commercial and industrial construction, as well as the replacement markets and the favorable reception to our new and redesigned projects. Gross profit increased 79.8% to $21.1 million from $11.7 million. Gross profit was 25.3% of sales compared to 17% of sales last year. The increase in gross profit is attributable to improved productivity from our new sheet metal fabrication equipment and our revamped production lines. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20.8% to $6.9 million from $5.7 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A remained constant at 8.3% of sales for the 3 months ended both June 30, 2012, and 2011. Operating income increased approximately 135% to $14.2 million or 17% of sales from $6 million or 8.7% of sales. Net income increased 142.2% to $9.3 million or 11.2% of sales from $3.8 million or 5.6% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.38 per share versus $0.15 per share in the same period a year ago. Earnings per shares were calculated on 24,728,000 shares versus 24,923,000 shares. The results of the 6 months ended June 30, revenues were up 15% to $148.3 million from $129 million. Gross profit increased 48.1% to $34.6 million from $23.4 million. Profit was 23.3% of sales compared to 18.12% of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14.5% to $12.9 million or 8.7% of sales in both periods. Operating income increased 7.3% to $21.8 million or 14.7% of sales from $12.1 million or 9.4% of sales. Net income increased 85.1% to $13.9 million or 9.2% of sales from $7.5 million or 5.8% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 per share versus $0.30 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,750,000 shares versus 24,931,000 shares. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that we have no long-term debt. We had a working capital balance of $48.3 million. Our current asset ratio was 1.9 to 2, which was affected by an increase that we had in inventories of about $4.2 million due to purchasing additional inventory to accommodate the increase that we had in our backlog and also due to an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $17.9 million, which was due to our increase in revenue. Shareholders' equity per share was $5.38 compared to $4.87. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with our new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Okay. We, basically, in order to get a better understanding of what is occurring for AAON, I have been -- I think break it down or talk about what the market place is doing, and then after that I'll enter in and talk about what AAON is doing, and then we'll kind of combine the 2 together as best we can. In the marketplace, there's really 2 segments to our market. There's the new construction market, then there's the renovation market. The new construction market is best typified and predicted by what is called the Architectural Billing Index. And if you work with that, you know that the 50% line is a neutral point, above 50% they are billing more work than they have the preceding year. If they're below the 50%, they're billing less work. This is the beginning point for all of our new construction, because if somebody doesn't design the building, nothing else happens. So this is an important index to watch, and it's normally the way that we try and predict what's going on. As stated by those [ph] people, when they bill that billing, it actually ends up in construction contracts approximately 9 to 12 months later. So it's always a good forward-looking index to look at. If we look at the most recent one I have available to me, which is June of this year, and try and decipher how much of the line was above the 50% and how much was below in the 2 preceding things, here's kind of the analysis that I've arrived at in trying to best judge their comparative values. In 2010, which basically affected 2011, and then 2011, which basically is affecting 2012. In trying to determine the difference between those 2, to get it [ph] to tell us whether we can anticipate more or less business from new construction this year is what -- the use, the value that has. And if I try and make that comparison to the best of my ability without having a lot of numbers, just looking at the graphs, I would say that there's a very close -- identical amount of work was done by the architects in 2010 for 2011 and '11 for 2012. And so no real noticeable trend is occurring that I can determine. The timing of it is a little bit different, depending upon where it fell in there, so the timing of when we get that available [ph] business, it could be different, but that is only the beginning point of our new construction. After the drawings are done and construction documents and everything are completed, the owner has to make a determination of about when to enter into a contract and put it out for bid, et cetera, so it's still distorted even further. So at that point, we lose control over our ability to view it. That being said, my belief is that at best, we're neutral in amount of work that's available to us for this year compared to amount of work that was available to last year. So last year's results give out a good picture of what's likely to occur in this year. Now let's switch a little bit and go to the remodeling and renovation market. There are no statistics really to tell me anything that I'm aware of in that realm, and that's something more I -- that we just get by working with. However, there was an event that occurred in December of 2010, which influenced both 2011 and 2012. And that was the Budget Reconciliation Bill that was passed in December of 2010. And contained within it was 100% write-off of qualified capital investments for the year 2011 on anything that was entered into and on the contract, completed and put into operation during the year 2011 could have 100% write-off of it. It's also contained the provision that anything that was entered into contract, shipped, installed or, and whatever and used in 2012 would get a 50% write-off if you wish to choose for it. So it had an effect on both years. Now the effect that it had was because in 2010, December was very late, so everyone being put on notice that you could get 100% write-off in 2011 didn't give any one much time to figure out what they wanted to do or could do, and consequently, everyone -- in my take on it, did not get into 2011 because of the timing and the thing that they have to do. The net result was we saw an upswing in new orders -- a large upswing in the first 7 months of 2011. We booked 19% more business than we did in 2010. And then in the last 5 months, in August, it fell below the 50 -- below what we did in 2010 and continued below through the rest of 2011 in bookings -- new orders. So we went from the 19% positive comparison to 2010 to a 9% negative comparison. So that kind of established what we had in order flow for us to build and ship. And now you can look at our 2011 results and see how that all worked out. Going into 2012, because these people who didn't get to participate and get into 2011, were all set up to participate in 2012. And what occurred in 2012 was that all of the orders or a large percentage of the orders that people wanted to have billed and shipped and take the 50% depreciation allowance were given to us in the first 3 months. We got a abnormally high -- roughly a 30% increase or 25% -- less 25% somewhere in there, depending upon how you looked at it, the increase in the first 3 months. However, they slipped back, and they didn't increase quite so much in the last -- in the second quarter compared to the previous one. The net result, if you go to the net result and take a look at it, it was roughly -- we got about 15% increase in 2012 over -- well, actually, 14.9% over 2011 for the first 6 months. So you can see that 30% slipped drastically in the next 3 months, and it has continued to somewhat reflect what it did before. Now that kind of comes off a little bit negative, which [Audio Gap] what it is and that -- a lot of the replacement market was pushed into the first half of the year. So we ended up shipping a lot, and particularly, in the month of June when all of that was wanted by the customers. And we had a tremendous third quarter -- or second quarter. The third quarter now does have some carryover from that increase in it. As you'll note, our 62% -- or $62 million in backlog was a little higher than it was the preceding year in 2011. But that being said, the marketplace has absorbed -- or the order desk has absorbed, I think, the majority of the replacement market that people really wanted to push forward. So we're going to be getting a lighter booking for the balance of this year out of the replacement market. So if you look at the marketplace, it's not a real winner for us in the construction industry. At best, in the total for the year, in my opinion, it's somewhat, as I've discussed earlier about the new construction, it's somewhat going to be a balance for the renovation market too, with it skewed a little bit toward the first part of the year. So then what does that say to us about where AAON is and what AAON is going to do? So we'll switch our conversation now from talking about the marketplace and go into talking about what changes have occurred in AAON, and what we kind of expect from AAON. While those of you who've been with us for a while know that we pursued an aggressive posture in creating new products for the past 3 or 4 years. And we did not slow down during the recession at all, we went right ahead. Very -- it's been a very fruitful thing for us, because we've been able to improve our ability to take market share. Now what am I talking about? What if we drop back to the year 2003 and view 2003 up through 2008. We were gaining market share at somewhere around 5%, 6% per year, and then if you did -- subtracted the inflationary factor from it was 5% or 6% market share gained during that time frame. And then from 2008 through 2011, we went, market wise if you look at our field -- at our numbers, we went down by 5% in this business. However, if you go into the governmental statistics on the types of buildings that we are selling product into [Audio Gap] and they published information on various types of buildings as far as the dollars that have been expanded on each, on every month throughout the year. And if you tabulate those 7 different markets -- building markets that we primarily support such as retail, commercial, educational, hospital, et cetera and compare 2008 to 2011, you'll come up with about a 37% reduction. And if you look at our performance over that time, you'll see we reduced about 5%. And take the inflation or deflation out of those numbers, and somewhere around 11%. So that new production or that new product that we produced enhanced, in my opinion, and other things we were doing of improving our sales operations and everything, improved our takeaway market share. In other words, what we're removing from the marketplace more than we normally would, up to about 11% per year rather than 5% per year. So that tells us that we've been hitting the market -- the target we set for the product, doing what it's doing. Now let's talk a little bit about what we're all about. Ever since we started out 24 years ago, we've had a business plan that set us 2 things that we were going to attempt to do. Number one, we were going to attempt to be the technological leader in the industry, sell upscale, sell more to owners, sell a product, which was the best value product for the dollar and pursue that part of the marketplace. Now what does that compares to? Well, majority of the marketplace and the majority of the people supplying that marketplace are pursuing the cost market, first cost market. That is not what we're pursuing. The first cost market is what they are pursuing more than we are. They, obviously, try and pursue what we do to some degree, and we to theirs to some degree. But fundamentally, we're pursuing the value-added market, which means energy efficiency, it means maintainability, it means life cycle and also, of course, it may -- it's first cost is mixed into it. But a heavy influenced on efficiency, life cycle, maintainability, [Audio Gap] mixed into other things, which caused you to own it. So we're geared up for more of the owner and the person who's got to pay the bills long term, whereas the first cost is more geared up toward the speculative builder and the speculative buildings. So you have to understand that a little bit in my mind because what happened in the recession, I believe, is the speculative market took a bigger beating than the owner market. In other words, the owners continued on and built the buildings they needed. The speculative-type construction suffered more of that recession that 37% fall back. So that has to be weighed in also into why we went from 5% to 11% of market share gain per year. As you can see, it's a pretty complex thought process at least in my mind that I run through here, trying to figure out what's going on. But the net result is, I believe, we've enhanced our ability to take market share quite considerably over what we had before. And we have, ever since we began this process 24 years ago, we've been taking market share fairly consistently, not always but over the long term, we have. The net result in trying to put a projection in -- for you people to try and figure out where AAON's going and what it's going to do, you have to think about the 2 things. The marketplace and how AAON is addressing the challenge. And that's where I'm trying to get you to. The other part of this, of course, has been the necessity to improve our sales force and to improve our support of the customers and all the supporting functions to our sales force. And when we started out, we started out very heavily leveraged with no money, and we were not able to do as well in those functions as we are today. Today, we are not suffering for a lack of money, we're suffering for maybe that we don't address something as fast or as well as we can. But our ability to support those functions is much better than it has ever been, so that has added to it. All these things are still with us and are going to be with us going forward. We're gaining strength in all these arenas every year, everyday. And so, even with the flat marketplace, which is what I believe we're facing, we still expect to have some growth. And as you could see, from last quarter, it might even be fairly substantial. Now I would not want to give you the idea you should extrapolate that because that would be a total misnomer. But we definitely believe that we've got the ability to continue to gain market share. We are, on dollar-wise, on new products -- approximately 70% of our dollars shipment are in these new products that we created over the past 3 or 4 years. We still have about 30% of our products to go through and upgrade, and we're in the process of doing that at the present time. The timetable for doing that, I would guess, mostly, it'll get done within the next year to 1.5 years. There will be -- some of it will drag out much longer than that, but the vast majority of that 30% will be operable sometime over the next year, 1.5 years. So we're continually improving our ability to move forward. Now I've got to -- in order for you to kind of put a feel for what I just talked about, you've got to understand that our industry is not a rapidly changing industry. Although it has been recently much more rapidly changing than it ever has in the past. But needless to say, there are still some products that we're competing against that I can think of that [Audio Gap] formidable competitor that the basic product was designed back in late 1960s. So that is a long time. That product manufacturer has been upgrading the details, but it's kind of like an automobile. It was designed back then and has had numerous facelifts and other things. It's really still fundamentally a 1960 design concept and with a lot of modifications to it. And so our industry doesn't change fast, and new ideas are not received well. The owners and the consulting engineers, they imply -- many times will tell you, it sounds like a wonderful idea. I see on paper that it's going to save a lot of money. And yes, I see all of those things, but why don't you come back after you've been in the market for about a year, and then we we'll talk about it. So even though we may be doing some things that may [Audio Gap] are justifying, moving faster, there is a kind of a bolt anchor hooked to us as far as how fast we can change. And so that's what we're faced within the marketplace. I, basically, have both a negative and a positive view. I have a negative view of the economic situation we're in. I have a negative view of it coming out. I don't see that where we're going right now is going to change our marketplace in the near future. I have a very positive view of what we're doing and what it's going to do for us. But putting those 2 together, it's going to be a challenge for the balance of the year without a question. Without any more to do on my part, I'd like to open it up for questions."
82,GV_021542_2013Q2,"Presentation Operator Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the AAON Second Quarter Sales and Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Norman Asbjornson. Please go ahead, sir. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Well, thank you, and thanks to all of you listening in to our second quarter report. Prior to embarking on it, I want to read the forward-looking disclaimer. To extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside of AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on 10-Q. Thank you. I would like now to turn the mic over to the financial department. I want you to be aware, we have Rebecca Thompson, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Scott Asbjornson, our Chief Financial Officer, here. At the present time, I'll turn it over to Scott. Scott M. Asbjornson VP of Finance & CFO Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the 3 months ended June 30, 2013 to June 30, 2012. Revenues were up 9.5% to $91.2 million from $83.3 million. Revenues increased due to gains in market share in the new commercial, industrial, construction and replacement markets and the result of price increases introduced in May 2012 and April 2013. Gross profit increased 31.1% to $27.7 million from $21.1 million. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 30.3% in the quarter just ended compared to 25.3% in Q2 2012. The improvement in gross margins can be attributed to decreases in raw material costs and increased product prices. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 31.7% to $9.1 million from $6.9 million in 2012. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 10.0% of total sales in the second quarter of 2013 and 8.3% in 2012. The increase in SG&A from the quarter ended June 30, 2012 was primarily due to higher profit sharing expense, warranty, sales taxes and employee compensation. Income from operations increased 31.4% to $18.6 million or 20.4% of sales from $14.2 million or 17% of sales. Our effective tax rate increased to 36.12% from 34.2% in the second quarter of 2012. We expect the rate for the balance of the year to be approximately 34.5%. Net income increased 30.4% to $12.1 million or 13.3% of sales from $9.3 million or 11.2% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.33 per share versus $0.25 per share. Diluted earnings per share were based on 37,150,000 shares versus 37,092,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. The results of the 6 months ended June 30. Revenues were up 6.6% to $158.1 million from $148.3 million. Gross profit increased 24.2% to $43 million from $34.6 million. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 72% -- sorry, 27.2% for the 6 months of 2013 compared to 23.3% in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 24.7% to $16.1 million or 10.2% of sales during 2013 from $12.9 million or 8.7% of sales, primarily due to increases in profit sharing, warranty, stock- based compensation, employee benefits, professional fees, advertising and sales taxes. Income from operations increased 24.0% to $27 million or 17.1% of sales from $21.8 million or 14.7% of sales. Our effective tax rate was 29.5% compared with 36.2% in the second quarter of 2012 due to discrete benefits related to the research and development credit and the Indian employment credit. These federal credits were retroactively reinstated on January 2, 2013. No research and development credit or Indian employment credit benefits were recorded in the 6 months ended June 30, 2012. Net income increased 38.9% to $19.3 million or 12.2% of sales from $13.9 million or 9.3% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.52 per share versus $0.37 per share. Diluted earnings per share were based on 37,056,000 shares versus 37,125,000 shares in the same period a year ago. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that we have a working capital balance of $67.8 million. Our current asset ratio was approximately 2.3:1. Our capital expenditures were approximately $1.9 million. Shareholder equity per diluted share is $4.11 at June 30, 2013 versus $3.73 at December 31, 2012. We paid cash dividends of $3.7 million on July 2, 2013. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with the new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Sales was up 9.5% for the quarter and 6.6% for the 6 months. Sales increased due to our ability to gain market share, price increases, all due to redesigned products. The replacement market was strong, but not overwhelmingly so. The new construction market continued to be weak compared to last year. We need to recognize that the -- and long-term indicator on new construction, which is the Architect's Billing Index has turned around in the fall of last year and, according to historical data, precludes or predetermines what's going to happen 9 to 12 months later. So we're just entering the time when we should get a boost in new construction compared to last year. But for the first part of this year, it was not positive, it was negative. Along that line, to give you a feeling of it, I'm going to inject some numbers for the various parts of our market. We basically compete in 7 different parts of the market: Lodging, office, commercial, health care, educational, religious and manufacturing. Of all those markets, the only 1 in June that had an upside to it is lodging. And lodging, to give you a feel, is roughly $40 million in the month of June compared to approximately $260 million for the total of the markets we compete in. So that small amount was the only one that was positive. All the rest of them were negative. The negative was approximately 5% in total for the month of June in comparing 2013 to 2012 for the month of June. So we haven't yet seen an increase in our market share. So why are we doing well and are up with 9.5%, as mentioned, and 6.6%? As we said, it's market share gained by the company, it is not the market itself that gave us the boost. Other markets that we're in, as far as basic -- that's got a kind of a good sound to it, has been the geothermal market and that was fairly stable and we are continuing to do reasonably well on it. In new products that we are gaining market share gradually would be chillers and air-handlings. These products fall across the entire spectrum of the markets that we're covering and we're slowly gaining market share on that end of the market. Take-off of the air handler is a split system market and that also has been growing for us. In the high-rise building market, which has been kind of flat and slow, basically, this is in the 30 to -- or I should say 10 storeys to the 100-storey building. There's a market product called a 4x4 unit that we entered a few years ago, and that is growing for us even though the market is fairly flat. We've also begun a more serious endeavor in parts sales. It isn't yet relating to any great improvement in dollar sales, but you should be aware of it, because as years go on, we're going to talk more about our parts business because we're seriously entering into the parts business and we have it off and running now and we're starting to build on it. There's no particular market that worked particularly well. As discussed in general, a lot of the new market, and we'll go back to talk briefly on the replacement market, it was healthy for the first 6 months. Might have been up a slight amount from 2012, but not appreciable. It was more flat than it was up. And as we've spoken before, new construction is down slightly from a year ago. The tone of the various markets we've discussed, as far as where we've been and what's going on. And so, I'd now like now to look at the backlog. Our backlog on 6/30/13 was $66.2 million versus $62.2 million a year ago. We did have a downturn from the end of the first quarter when we had over $70 million, so we have eaten up some of our backlog. The incoming order rate has slowed. As I had mentioned in our news release, it's looking softer. Now does that say it's going to be softer than 2013 -- or 2013 is going to be softer than 2012? No, I don't believe it is. I think that it's going to start growth -- slight growth, but for it to do very much and have us actually ship it, not very much of that is going to happen. However, on new orders that worked because of taking market share, we will continue to get growth on a year-to-year basis. It's just that it won't be in the magnitude that the first half of the year was because the market isn't supporting it at this point in time on new order input. Gross profit as a percent of sales. We believe it was the most outstanding profit as percent of sales of any company in our industry. And to get there, our gross profit in the month or in the quarter was 30.3% compared to 25.3% in 2012. Our year-to-date gross profit was likewise quite high at 27.2% compared to 23.3% in 2012. As was discussed earlier, SG&A expenses have increased to 10% for the quarter versus 8.3% in the quarter of 2012. And to 10.2% for the 6 months versus 8.7% in 2012. It would appear to us that we have, for a whole lot of reasons, increased our SG&A expenses slightly and you should look for a 9% to 10% as the new norm for that. The net income, up to 30.4% and up 38.9% for the 6 months, was an outstanding achievement, I believe, and was due to virtually everything working well that we tried to make work well. That doesn't often happen and it's not too likely to be done again. However, again, not to be too cautionary, we are going to whip last year's results. The question is, how well can we do it? We have pretty high ambitions but, from your standpoint of guessing what we should do, that's up to you to try and decide as to what you believe we're capable of doing. The balance sheet, we've increased our liquidity considerably. The outlook for the remainder of 2013, we've been discussing. The capital expenditures for 2013, we had originally told you, would be in the $8 million to $10 million area. That would be on the high side of what our expectations are presently. We basically, as has been discussed previously, expended most of our capital needs and we're filling in gaps now, some of them we haven't gotten filled as quickly as we should. One of the ones which we were anticipating doing a little sooner and hasn't moved forward quite as fast is a small building program, which we have embarked upon now, but all of it will not happen in this coming 6 months. So we're going to be down below our expectations, I believe, of $8 million to $10 million. The outlook for next year. We are continuing to bring out new products. We are, this month, going to introduce some new chillers and some new condensing units that will be a great improvement to our old ones. We're introducing some new coils, which gives us a better product and a little cost reduction. So the march forward continues on and we're pretty optimistic that if the marketplace will just hold steady, we will do well. And if the marketplace will gain a little bit, we will do wonderfully well. I don't have anything else at this point, so I want to thank you for your attention. I look forward to talking to you in November for our second quarter results. And now, I'll turn it over to question and answers."
83,GV_021542_2007Q3,"Presentation Operator Good day and welcome to today's AAON Incorporated Third Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. Just to remind you, this call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Norman Asbjornson. Please go ahead, sir. Norman Asbjornson Good afternoon. Thank you. Before I go any further, I'd like to read the forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such a statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ substantially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Thank you. I would like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our Vice President and CFO, and turn it over to her. Thank you. Kathy? Kathy Sheffield Good afternoon and welcome to our conference call. We appreciate your attendance today. I'd like to begin by discussing the results of the three months that ended September 30th, 2007 compared to September 30th, 2006. Our revenues were up 11% to $70.9 million from $64.2 million. Our gross profit remained constant at $13.6 million for both periods and was 19.2% of sales for 2007 compared to 21.2% for 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the third quarter by 7.9% to $5.5 million or 7.7% of sales from $6 million or 9.3% of sales for the same time last year. Operating income increased 6.8% to $8.2 million or 11.5% of sales from $7.6 million or 11.9% of sales. Net income went down to $5.4 million or 7.6% of sales compared to 8.4% of sales last year. Diluted EPS for both quarters of 2007 and 2006 were $0.28 per share. Now, for the nine months that ended September 30th, revenues were up 13.3% to $200.4 million from $176.9 million. Gross profit increased 31.9% to $45 million or 22.5% of sales from $34.1 million or 9.3% of sales. Our SG&A expenses increased for the first nine months by 7.3% to $16.5 million or 8.2% of sales from $15.4 million or 8% of sales for 2006. Operating income increased 52% to $28.5 million or 14.2% of sales from $18.7 million or 10.6% of sales. Net income increased 47.5% to $18.6 million or 9.3% of sales from $12.6 million or 7.1% of sales. Diluted EPS for the nine months was $0.98 per share versus $0.66 per share a year ago. Our earnings per share for the three months and nine months period of both years were based on approximately 19 million shares and are reflective of the company's three-for-two stock split that occurred on August 21st. Moving to the balance sheet now, the current asset ratio increased to 2:5 from 1:7 for the same period last year due primarily to higher accrued liabilities based on our higher sales that are related to both warranty and commissions payable. Our capital expenditures for the nine months ending September 30th were $8.7 million. Expenditures were related to new equipment purchased to increase production efficiency and also to some renovations to our Tulsa facility. Shareholders equity per share as of September 30th was $5.69 compared to $4.85 for the same period a year ago. Also, the company paid cash dividends of $5 million in 2007 and also bought back stocks from certain retirement incentive plans in the amount of $7.1 million. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm who will discuss our results in further detail along with new product information and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman Asbjornson Thank you. There are a number of things which need to be discussed here relative to what's happening in the economy and also in our Canadian facility; to the economy first. In the month of July, we found that there was some sort of happening occurring. We don't know what is happening in the marketplace. And we had an unexpectedly low booking month in July, as compared to our June booking. We were talking to our representatives who said they have plenty of jobs they were sure they were getting, but for whatever reasons the contractors weren't placing the orders as fast as it was anticipated. It caused us some concern and we started not replacing workers in our facilities, thinking that we were on the edge of the downturn. And so we started letting attrition slow the workforce down. Regarding August, all of a sudden the situation reversed itself, and these anticipated orders started coming in and we were moving forward at a brisker pace. August continued into September and in October there was the same thing. So what happened? To give you some percentages that reflect what happened, over the four-month period, starting from the end of June in the 1st of July through the end of October, our total input of orders was up 12.9% even with that weak month of July. If we just take the three months and discount the July numbers altogether, in the last three months, our orders compared to 2006 were up 44.5%. So you can see there's been a remarkable switch. Whatever was occurring in July didn't continue. In fact, everything got much healthier than what we had anticipated. So as that was occurring, we had already started reducing our workforce. Of course, we had a little higher drop-off than what we were anticipating in the way of revenue. We thought and should have gotten up somewhere around 15% revenue growth, instead we got about 11% revenue growth. Some of that we couldn't turn around, because since the orders didn't come in during July, we couldn't ship them out. We wouldn't have shipped hardly in August, but we would have shipped a fair number of them in September if we had the manpower or setup to do so. So that did have a revenue effect upon our P&L statement, and it also, of course, had a bottomline effect on the same period of time. So this is a portion of the problem. Another, if I take a look at October so we can give you a sense of how much it’s changing. I've already told you that if I took the four months revenue, and it was up 12.9% compared to 2006, and I told you that if I only took the last three months, it's up 44.5%, If I just take October by itself, it's up 57.2% compared to a year ago. So it's throwing a lot of difficulties in forecasting, I guess, is what I could say. It does indicate one thing though, which we said in our release this morning, we're anticipating and we have gone back into the hiring mode and into building up our workforce again. And we expect to have a good fourth quarter for this reason as far as orders coming in. the door. However, on the other side of the situation, a problem which we mentioned in the release this morning has to do with the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar, plus the operation of the Canadian facility. The operation of the Canadian facility continued to be less than anticipated and not making money during the three months. This was magnified by the operating part of it. The majority of the problem turned out to be the exchange rate and how the exchange rate affects us. It's like this. Most of the sales that we do out of the Canadian facility are done in the United States. So if we take an order in the United States for $1 and when we took it, we thought we were going to exchange it for $1.20 or something in Canadian dollars. In reality, by the time we ship it and collect the money, we get something like $0.97 or $0.98 instead of getting $1.20. So of course, the exchange rate change is a very significant thing. Now then, we were booking business in the Canadian facility very well in the first part of the year anticipating that we were going to speed the facility up. We've had a great deal of difficult trying to speed the facility up. So it became obvious that we weren't going to meet the revenue numbers we were trying for, and so we started slowing the order input down at the end of March, and we did that by increasing prices. The net result, however, is that the orders that we took before that time period had to be shipped and are still being shipped out of that facility today. So the exchange rate that we're looking at is not just between what we collect for today, but what we anticipated in the first part of the year. So there is a problem which will continue into the fourth quarter with us. It will have about the same effect on us as it did in the third quarter, we think. The exchange rate for those of us who aren't watching it would be anticipated based upon trend lines and based upon various people's comments in the newspaper and whatever the Canadian dollar is worth, as much as $1.10 or $1.05 by the end of the year. So that's a negative [bonus]. Summing up, what I'm seeing right now, our Longview facility is doing very well. The orders for the air handler that we started building down there haven't grown as fast as we thought, as early as we thought. They are now growing the way we thought they would, but we had a delayed reaction in how fast that started happening. And it's picking up speed. In the Tulsa operation, as I mentioned with the numbers I have given you here, we have an input of orders which tells us we're picking up speed again in the Tulsa facility. So those two which equate to over 90% of our business are looking very good, and we've got something less than 10% out of the Canadian facility, which is looking bad. It's kind of like having a speck or something in your eye. It bothers you very much, but it's not a big deal to clean it out. It just sometimes takes a little bit of time, and that's what we anticipate here. We are looking at several alternative actions, but we're not going to continue to have these losses for very long. That kind of gives a very quick summary of what's going on. Now, from an operational standpoint, a couple of questions sometimes are asked. What about your bad debts or bad debt reserve? And our bad debt experience has been trending down for a number of years and is continuing to trend down. Our warranty expense is trending down and has been trending down for a number of years. We expect to hold that. Now, let's talk a little bit about the expectations for next year; what we see and what we're reading. There are various things that are out there that are making predictions about trendlines. I would say that from my experience, right now, the trend of the industry, not talking about AAON, but just talking about the industry, would tell me that commercial construction is probably going to slowdown somewhere maybe to little or no growth, and even possibly becoming a little bit negative. A lot of people would say, well, what about the residential situation? The general tenure of everything I read is it's had a substantial reduction this year, but the reduction is moderating and isn't expected to continue too much into next year. And there is talk of it being somewhere around no reductions for the year 2008. So there has been a little slowdown. Now how does all of that affect my perception of what AAON has the capabilities of doing? We aren't going to be introducing a lot of new products, but we have already introduced a number of new products that are anywhere from five years into their life history to just a couple of months into their life history. So we anticipate those to pick up momentum and grow. And they are things, which in many cases, like I said some are very recent, work in our -- they have worked before. If I go down to all of our product lines one-by-one and look at the growth from year-to-year, it's obvious that one of our big growth factors are units which we did introduce four or five years ago, mainly our larger tonnage equipment, which includes large tonnage rooftop units, water chillers and large tonnage condensing units. These have grown at a much faster rate and show every sign of continuing that growth. We are a very small part of that portion of the commercial market. And so even a flat market I don't think is going to have much effect upon our growth. I think we're going to continue our growth because we have some very marketable things that are not copies of other peoples. Its niche marketing and we're filling a niche that is, in our opinion, needs to be filled. And so, we anticipate that to grow as fast as we want, we need to tell our story and get people to listen and realize the value we got available. In the smaller tonnage grouped ups, likewise, we're experiencing substantial growth on a year-to-year basis, and much of that is, as far as we can see, going to continue. Those of you who have been listening to us for quite sometime, know that being a very limited customer-based company over the years to becoming a much broader-based, and through that cycle we went through a lot of national accounts in big time. And as we've grown and we’ve had to choose sometimes between our customers because of our limitations on production capability, we've tended to go toward the general market, a little bit away from the national accounts for a number of reasons. This meant less reliance on fewer customers et cetera, et cetera, and a little more profitable part of the business world. And we are now pretty well stabilized with a good national account business as well as a good general business other than national accounts which include schools, houses, hospitals, and a lot of other facilities, which sometimes run counter to the general market condition. This occurs because many of these are governmental-supported facilities, and they will sometimes spend money to get the marketplace growing a little faster. So it's, in our opinion it is still a good viable market for us to continue our growth pattern. But the nature of it is changing apparently. But as I said, if we were just to look at recent trends for the last three months, and even if we go back and pick up the very weak month of July, we're still up 12.9%. And if we just look at the last three months, we're up 44.5%, and if I looked at last month, up 57.2%. So the trend line is obviously not down. That being said, I think I'll turn it over to you people to ask questions. Hello? <TAG>Question-and-Answer Session</TAG>"
84,GV_021542_2010Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to AAON Inc. Third Quarter Sales and Earnings Report Conference Call. I will now turn it over to your host, Norman Asbjornson. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon, thank you for joining us in AAON's Third Quarter Investor's Conference Call. I'd like to read a forward-looking disclaimer before proceeding. To the extent that any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to occurrences of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. And with that, I'd like to introduce, Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. Kathy? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Thank you, Norm. Good afternoon. Welcome to our conference call and thank you for joining us this afternoon. I'd like to begin by discussing the results of the three months ended September 30. We're pleased to announce our revenues were up 10.9% to $64.9 million from $58.5 million. Revenues increased due to the positive response to our new products and to gaining additional market share. Gross profit decreased 29.4% to $12.5 million from $17.7 million. Gross profit was 19.3% of sales during 2010 compared to 30.3% of sales during 2009. The gross margin percentages were narrowed by higher raw material and manufacturing cost, increased labor expenses and our inability to implement price increases given the economic environment. Also, the third quarter a year ago benefited from a $1 million reduction in cost of sales resulting from our hedging of copper. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 1.9% to $5.2 million or 8% of sales, from $5.3 million or 9.1% of sales. The decrease was due to lower bad debt and warranty expense, a decrease in sales-related expenses and a decrease in profit sharing expense due to lower net income. Operating income decreased 41.1% to $7.3 million or 11.3% of sales from $12.4 million or 21.2% of sales. Our effective tax rate remains at 35%. However, we did receive a tax benefit in the third quarter due to an increase in the domestic production activity tax credit from 6% to 9%, higher R&D tax credits than expected with the filing of our 2009 income tax return and bonus depreciation which was reinstated in September of this year. Net income decreased 32.5% to $5.2 million or 8% of sales from $7.7 million or 13.2% of sales. Diluted EPS was $0.31 per share versus $0.45 per share. Earnings per share were based on 16,647,000 shares versus 17,304,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. In addition related to the quarter comparison, our 2009 net income benefited $600,000 or $0.04 per share due to the copper derivative mentioned in the gross profit discussion. The result of the nine months, our revenues were down 6.5% to $178.7 million from $191.1 million. Gross profit decreased 22.3% to $41 million from $52.8 million. Gross profit was 22.9% for the nine months of 2010 compared to 27.6% in 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 11% to $16.6 million or 9.2% of sales from $18.6 million or 9.7% of sales. Operating income decreased 28.5% to $24.4 million or 13.7% of sales from $34.1 million or 17.9% of sales. Net income decreased 25.5% to $16.1 million, or 9% of sales from $21.6 million or 11.3% of sales. Diluted EPS for the year was $0.95 per share compared to $1.25 per share a year ago. EPS was based on 16,981,000 shares versus 17,318,000 shares. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that we continue to have a strong liquidity position at $4.1 million in cash which aids our goal to stay as liquid as possible during today's uncertain economic times. Our current asset ratio was 2:1. Capital expenditures were $13.1 million related to the completion of our Tulsa building expansion and for equipment purchases to set up additional manufacturing lines in that expansion. Shareholders equity per share is $6.94 compared to $6.85 in 2009. We paid cash dividend of $3.1 million both in January and July of 2010. I'd like now to turn the call back over to Norm who will discuss our results in further detail along with a new product and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you, Kathy. Sales as was noted were up almost 11% for the quarter, but down 6% for the nine months. We had a lot of turmoil, as we're all aware, but let me tell you what we see in AAON's analysis of all this. We have been embarked upon a very significant change in our product design. We've invested considerable effort and money into new products and we watch and monitor what occurs as we introduce such products to see whether we're hitting our targets as far as improving our market position with the new products over the old products. The first major one that we were watching was what we call our C box which was 16-ton to 30-ton box introduced in the fall of 2008. We watched that to see and it showed surprisingly a good acceptance and increased relative efficiency of sales compared to our other product lines in the previous product line. The next product that we introduced was what we call our B box which goes from 8 tons through 15 tons, introduced in the late fall of 2009. And during the second quarter, we saw that also doing a similar move forward in claiming more market share than our previous product would have claimed. The last two which were introduced as our A box introduced the mid-second quarter and RQ box introduced at the very end of the second quarter. What we were seeing was fulfilling our expectations of what we were hoping from the new product and was starting to give us increased marketability of our product line. And therefore, at the end of the second quarter, we started reversing some of what we we're doing at that time which was a heavy stock buyback. And we said, we are going to have to start getting ready for when the market turns, and our penetration of the market had already turned on us, and we anticipated that the A box and the RQ box will perform similarly to what the C and B box. And at this point in time, I'm pleased to tell you that, that does appear to be occurring. Therefore, we started considering how we were going to handle this. We were faced with a couple of other interesting aspects, one of which was the fact that some of our machinery in our East facility, our East facility handles approximately 1/3 of our Production business in the Tulsa area where we originally began work, and was sort of obsolete and maybe a little unplanned in the way we organized that building because we've had a couple of additions onto it and during our growth started out very much smaller than we were now. And so it's not a very efficient building plus the equipment that we were manufacturing in was getting old and worn out. So we were going to have to do something in the not-too-distant future. And in the downturned economy, as long as we had the capital to do so, we felt it was advisable to effect a lot of this redesign of this facility and refitting of the facility as soon as possible. In order to accomplish that and not lose productivity of our product, we were going to have to overstock the West side with machinery, and so we did. We changed our plans a little bit. We bought, committed to quite a few millions of dollars worth of additional equipment which will not be delivered until the end of this year and the first part of next year, but on which we had to make a down payment of approximately $5 million which is included in our capital expenditures year-to-date. So that is really, future, that $5 million is basically new product, or new equipment we haven't yet received. That will then allow us to dismember some of the old equipment and begin replacing it on the East side facility of the Tulsa facility. In addition to which the products which we had brought out new back in 2008 and first part of 2009 out of our Longview facility, we're also doing extremely well all year and they were starting, even though we had done quite a bit of renovation and expansion of that facility in recent years, we started outrunning our sheet-metal capability down there and needed more sheet-metal capability down there. So we included in that machinery purchase some more equipment for that facility to be delivered in the first quarter of next year. So all of these things, we changed our game plan a little bit, added a lot of capital expenditure which we hadn't originally planned on, plus some of the equipment that was available now was better than the equipment which we had anticipated being available when we did choose to buy new equipment. The market, however, has continued to be soft and softening. And there's a good leading index called the Architectural Billing Index, and that billing index, any time it’s below 50%, indicates a continued downturn in the amount of hours and dollars billed by the architectural firms in the United States which would say that we're going to have fewer architects design buildings available for selling equipment. That, however, had been moderating during the year and not going down quite as quickly as it was earlier in the year and has, in fact, finally at long last, gotten up to the neutral point of 50% and just barely over it in September. So things are turning but the billing index only talks about what they are doing in the way of designing buildings, and that always has a lag effect before we get to pick up an order for it, up somewhere up toward one year from the time that they start increasing production of buildings simply due to the prime lag of issuing those proposed building improvements or new buildings out into the trade, the bidding off them, and us finally getting an order and getting ready to build the product. So it's not a quick thing, but it is a very welcome thing that we're observing. So that was turning, market share was going forward, so we had to accelerate even more the preparation we had to make internally so that we could handle it as it really gets going. Now we have always had an excess of capacity, but the other good thing about a lot of these things that we're talking about right now is they come with an improvement in productivity, and our productivity  has always been a very high thing for us. And so not only are we preparing for future business and being able to handle our present business more efficiently, but we're also doing at a time when we're not being pressed quite so much to increase our production. And therefore, we have more time available to handle it in a more efficient manner and do a better job of buying equipment and planning our forward movement. The general tone of business, however, like I say, while the future is starting to look good, none of the buildings other than medical and healthcare and education of the strongest ones, along with general governmental type buildings, those are really the three strong ones at this point in time. All the rest of buildings, commercial, retail, office, manufacturing, lodging, municipalities are fairly good, but a lot of the rest are still looking pretty poor. But with our improvement in sales and our substantial improvement in backlog, most of which has been building here in the last few months. In other words, most of that we were still going down, all the balance of last year from September on through the rest of the year, we were reducing our backlog and the backlog did not start improving until the first quarter got a little bit better but not much, in the second quarter gained speed, the third quarter it gained significant additional speed. And that's why the backlog has gone up substantially but our sales haven't gone up so much because most of it is a fairly recent time of change into our backlog. So the fourth quarter, as you can well appreciate, it does much look better on the volume standpoint. However, it needs to be remembered that, that backlog is going in there at basically 2008 price levels and might even be a little bit on the weak side of that because we have added some standard features to our product at no additional cost over these past two years. The incoming order rate continues to be much solider than it has been, and we have initiated somewhat of a price increase down into our Longview facility which has gotten most healthy part of that increase backlog. And so we have decided that we could afford to take a chance on losing a little bit of volume and going for some more margin, and we have effective as basically virtually today while we're talking, it's in the process of occurring on new orders coming in the house which of course will be somewhere two to three months before they ship. But we have been able to at least effect a little bit of improvement down there. I don't see that, the improvement, in the near future in the Tulsa product line but undoubtedly some point down the road here I believe we will see the time when we can start improving our margins with pricing. In the interim, we are improving margins by improved productivity as we wrap up the West side manufacturing facility in Tulsa, which we're still spending considerable money on doing. We are increasing our volume capabilities in that facility which, in turn, is improving productivity of those product lines built in that area. As I said earlier, about 2/3 of the Tulsa facility outlook comes out of West building and 1/3 is coming out of the East building. So longer term, you can look for us to be going into these buildings. Now one of the other things that has pushed us to accelerate things has been an increase in the depreciation schedule on capital equipment because of course getting a -- being able to take a depreciation faster means you're not putting a long-term loan out to the federal government, no interest which is what happens when you stretch your depreciation out over many years. So it's beneficial to us even though it kind of upsets our P&L status and the balance sheet and everything because of the increased capital expenditures and everything the way it’s handled. It's going to be very beneficial to us and you can see quite a significant amount more, $3 million or so that will start happening between now and the end of the year because we've tried to accelerate the delivery of all capital items that we can into this year. The SG&A sales, as Kathy mentioned, were pretty good for the quarter. They were down compared to the previous year due to the things which she mentioned, which indicates the fact that we've been able to maintain all relative issues within our SG&A at a very good rate even though we've increased our volume, we haven't had a corresponding upswing in SG&A. Most everything else on the negative side of it has come about by virtue of cost increases, pretty much led by commodity price increases, which also relates to some increases in purchased finished goods parts, like motors and things of that nature which because they are also heavily impacted by commodities, have started to come through with price increases on those items as well. So that's been hammering us on our bottom line. At this point in time, I don't know what more to tell you about for this year. We're going to stay as liquid as we can, our stock buyback has been suspended in the third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, when we decided to put the emphasis on sales on the capital expenditures. Just to summarize, we finished off an old stock buyback plan plus dipped into a new stock buyback plan. Our total purchases of stock during the year-to-date have been 780,939 shares for $18,457,694. The other thing which we have done and what we have is dipped into the new authorization which was 850,000 shares authorized, and we have still remaining open on that 371,507 shares. Our cash position will remain pretty liquid. And we're feeling good about where we are and how we're managing that and how we're getting ready for what we hope will be a much healthier economic situation and much higher growth pattern for the company. This is our outlook and hope. Our sales for 2010 fourth quarter is going to be better, obviously, than 2009 due to the healthy backlog. And as I mentioned, our capital expenditures when we finish will be in the $16 million, maybe a little bit more, for the year in total. I'd like to open it up now for questions regarding what we've been discussing."

Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Thank you, again. I would like now to turn this over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Sheffield. Kathy? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Thank you, Norm. Good afternoon. Welcome to our conference call. I'll begin today by discussing the comparative results of the 3 months ended September 30, 2011, compared to September 30, 2010. We're very pleased to report that our revenues were up 14% to $73.8 million from $64.9 million. Revenues increased due to gaining additional market share, the favorable reception to our new products and a price increase on one specific product line. Gross profit increased 14.1% to $14.3 million from $12.5 million. Gross profits stayed consistent at 19.3% of sales for both quarters. The gross margin continued to be affected by raw material and component part -- price increases, and also by costs associated with the introduction of some new products in our Longview facility. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.4% to $5.4 million or 7.4% of sales from $5.2 million or 8% of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was primarily due to lower bad debt, professional fees and selling-related expenses. Operating income increased 20.2% to $8.8 million or 11.9% of sales from $7.3 million or 11.3% of sales. Net income increased 9% to $5.6 million or 7.6% of sales from $5.2 million or 8% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 per share versus $0.21 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,844,000 shares versus 24,971,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. As we look at the 9 months result, we see that revenues were up 13% to $202.8 million from $178.7 million. Gross profit decreased 8.2% to $37.6 million from $41 million. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 18.5% for the 9 months of 2011 compared to 22.9% in 2010. In addition to the quarter detail, year-to-date margins were also affected by various manufacturing and facility problems previously reported, which we experienced in the earlier part of the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained consistent at $16.7 million or 8.2% of sales from $16.6 million or 9.2% of sales. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased due to lower profit sharing, warranty and bad debt expenses. Operating income decreased 14.2% to $20.9 million or 10.3% of sales from $24.4 million or 13.7% of sales. Our effective tax rate increased from 29% to a more normalized 35% due to federal tax credits received in 2010. Net income decreased 19% to $13.1 million or 6.5% of sales from $16.1 million or 9% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.53 per share versus $0.63 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,902,000 shares versus 25,471,000 for the same time a year ago. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that we had a working capital balance of $41.7 million. Our current asset ratio was 2:1. Our capital expenditures were $31.2 million. Shareholders equity per share was $5.08 compared to $4.72 a year ago. We paid cash dividends of $3 million in July 2011. I would now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with our new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you, Kathy. Despite a rather difficult economic situation, sales were up 14% for the quarter and 13% for the 9 months. The sales increase for the 3 months and 9 months in this rather severely contracted market compared to 3 or 4 years ago is due to greatly increased market share, which we have taken. The first part of the year, we were blessed with a substantial increase in replacement market, while the new construction market was pretty soft. And the replacement market was primarily implemented by virtue of a December last year tax change, which allowed 100% depreciation on certain qualified assets, which a lot of air conditioning equipment qualified for. Therefore, it stimulated quite a bit of the replacement market in the first half of the year. We did see a falloff in orders from that market right around the middle of the year, apparently because of the fact in order to qualify for it. It had the -- products had to be built, shipped, installed and operating by the end of the year to be fully qualified. Therefore, people felt they had to order in the first half of the year and for the most part, get it shipped in the first half of the year. Thus, we did get a softening, which we anticipated and we had discussed at our previous quarterly meeting, due to this removal of the 100% depreciation. The way it is structured right now, it drops back to a 50% depreciation and then extending out the rest of the depreciation on a normal scale. So we've already experienced the change that is due, the majority of the change. We are, however, still shipping some of that product that was ordered in the first half of the year, but it's diminishing rapidly so it's not having a pronounced effect on us, particularly at this point in time. However, at the same time, I'm saying that, there has been, in a few categories, an upswing in new construction. It's still limited and it's still not back to where it was a year ago. It's still softer than that, but it's just marginally softer than a year ago. And the areas where we're experiencing the upturn, based upon the report that we received from the federal government on product put in place in various categories, the places where it's gotten stronger are in commercial construction and then manufacturing, quite a nice experience, I think, to see it happening in manufacturing, which has been on a long-term downturn for several years. And we now are seeing a modest amount of growth occurring in the manufacturing arena as far as selling heating and air conditioning equipment into that marketplace. The balance of the marketplace, which is lodging, office buildings, healthcare, educational and religious, are still modestly down. The very biggest part of that entire spectrum of dollars that are expended is in the educational arena, which is down as compared to a year ago by about 3.2%. And it's down modestly from August, so it is not yet in the recovery mode that commercial and manufacturing are experiencing. So what I'm kind of seeing occur here at the present time is sort of a stabilizing, a shifting back from the replacement market into the new construction market that does exist. The net result of this, even though the new construction market is very modestly down, the backing off of the replacement market is decidedly for the potential sale of products or deterioration in our marketplace. Thus, what we've had to do in order to offset that is take market share, which we've been able to do fairly well. Of course, in taking market share, it's a very difficult thing on your bottom line too, because it's a highly competitive situation out there. And while we've done very well and improved our bottom line, it has been certainly difficult to get it as far as I would like to have it recovered. However, the other really good thing is we finally have started getting ourselves out of all the problems, which we started having in the first part of the year due to the snowstorm collapsing our roof in 3 different major areas of the factories here in Tulsa. Those are now behind us. They were modestly, very modestly affecting our performance in the third quarter because we never really upped the building all closed in until about a month ago now. The final hole was closed up. So that's all historic now, but it did have a slight effect on us, but not very much in the third quarter. So we're sort of back to where -- you might say we're in a normal operating mode without all these other troublesome problems causing us to be distracted in spending a lot of time and effort and money dealing with them. As we're going forward now, we're ramping up the construction of the 207,000 square feet of warehouse space that we're putting into this building. And this is going to have a very noticeable effect going forward. It's very hard to quantify and difficult for us to see, and it probably won't really make itself totally felt until the second quarter of next year. But what it's allowed us to do is to -- when we get using it, which, as I say, will not really be fully effective until second quarter next year, but beginning in the first quarter of next year, we will be using this building an increasing amount. And to give you a feel for this, the warehouse that we have been using overloaded and distributing stuff all over the entire building perimeter and outside into the parking lot and everything, was probably only capable of handling about somewhere in the 30% or 40% of the dollar volume, which we're presently doing. So we're badly overloading our present warehouse, and that's caused us a lot of inefficiency in distributing product, in distributing parts and getting them around. So you can look for an improvement in efficiencies due to this new warehouse coming onstream next year. The other very good thing coming along is the fact that this past year, and a little bit over the past year but with a heavy emphasis on this year that we're in right now, we've expended over $30 million in capital expenditures, partially on the building, but more importantly, on our production equipment. And that was due to the fact that when that law was passed last fall, I could not see how I could afford to not replace a lot of badly worn equipment that, although it was still running, it did have a huge amount of operating hours, anywhere from 60-some thousand to almost 100,000 operating hours on it. And if you take that out against 8,760 total hours in a normal year, you can see that we had more in that -- used that equipment quite extensively. So we basically replaced all that older equipment through this year. And instead of -- as I was speaking last year at this time, thinking that I was going to do about $10 million worth of expenditure and capital goods, we're expanding over $30 million. The good thing about that is all these new machines, while the old machines were still running pretty well, they were pretty sloppy and their holding of tolerances and everything and they did break down quite often. And furthermore, they were slower. And the slower is the important thing here because the new machines, while they're from the same company and the same general character, are much faster than the older machines. The older machines, being somewhere between 10 years and 13 years old, and the new machines almost double the productivity of the operator. And therefore, the operating cost of doing sheet metal is going to be substantially reduced by these units. Now in total, what this means is we replaced and upped productivity somewhere around 40% of our manufacturing, sheet metal manufacturing equipment. So it will be significant on improved productivity next year. It will also allow us with -- the new products, which we've been putting into place very rapidly the past few years, to continue to offer to our customers a superior, technologically superior and substantially improved energy-efficient piece of equipment with all the most recent known improvements in this type of equipment. So we're very quickly turning our troubles around from being one of a manufacturing challenge and designing new equipment to being a marketing challenge. And that is a change in the direction which we're having to go at this point in time. If the economy were to cooperate a little better, we would, without question, have quite a booming year ahead of us. Unfortunately, everything I see and all the indexes and everything don't tell me that we're going to see a booming economy in the construction industry. To the contrary, it says that it's going to be very difficult for the construction industry to match this year's performance. So it generally shows that it will be at this year or slightly down next year from everything that I can decipher about the industry. However, I don't intend to participate in that. I think with what we have done and everything we've got going for us, we're definitely going to get some growth into next year. The amount of growth is highly questionable at this time, but we are optimistic that we are not going to have to follow the downward or the likely downward trend that the building industry appears to have. The other part that is going to be encouraging is that some of these new products, which we have introduced and in fact are still introducing as we speak, are into some areas which we never really participated in before. And the biggest one of that -- those areas, probably is -- at this point in time, we still haven't introduced is a unit that goes from 55 tons to 130 tons. And while we were in that market in the tonnage, we were in there with a high-class, highly capable product, which will we will retain for that market. But we now brought in a lower-cost, highly competitive product for that market, and it is a significant dollar market still, although it's not the biggest one in our industry by any means. But it will have a noticeable affect upon our volume of sales. And since it is a competitively costed product, we should be able to make a decent margin on it and do well on the bottom line with the product. So basically, that's what's occurring in the arena of the sales, marketing and everything in the past and in the future at this point in time. Our earlier aspect that I should mention a little bit is we are continuing to have growth in the geothermal market. We're having growth in the other new products that we have introduced out there. And those are into markets which we are either somewhat new in or very new in. And so, there's a good chance that we can also penetrate those markets more thoroughly than we have in the past and help ourselves gain additional market share. If I look at the building market, the one thing which does come with true lies, I'm being kind of negative about it, and that's primarily because there is an index out there called the Architect's Billing Index, which has been running a negative for 5 out of the past 6 months. And what that says is the architects are not charging for as much design work as they had in the preceding corresponding period. And therefore, the likelihood of there being as many buildings out there to bid on is diminishing. However, it's not a substantial down, that 5 out of 6 is not terribly down, it's just down. Therefore, speaking to what I did before, it's probably going to give us a little bit of a negative market for next year and the way it looks, at least, for the first half of the year, but not a substantial downswing. I'm basically quite optimistic in total for the company, because in all of the things which we've done with the buildings and with the products and with the enhancing of our sales force, we have continued to upgrade our sales force, and things are pretty much on track for what our business plan is. It's just that it's a little more slow in coming to life than I had hoped it would be. As we all look at the economic situation, I'm sure I'm not saying something out of school in that regard. So with that being said, I would like to open it up now to questions."
86,GV_021542_2012Q3,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon. Welcome to AAON Inc. sales and earnings for the third quarter ending September 30. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. Norman Asbjornson here. Before proceeding, I'd like to read a forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. I'd like now to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Asbjornson. Scott M. Asbjornson VP of Finance & CFO Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the 3 months ended September 30, 2012 to September 30, 2011. Revenues were up 4% to $76.8 million from $73.8 million. Revenues increased due to gains in market share in the nonresidential and replacement markets, and also as the result of price increases introduced earlier in the year. Gross profit increased 20.3% to $17.1 million from $14.2 million. As a percentage of sales, gross margins were 22.3% in the quarter just ended, compared to 19.3% in 2011. Improvement in gross margins can be attributed to changes in commodity costs, increased product prices, improved product mix and productivity. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 23.8% to $6.7 million from $5.4 million in 2011. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 8.8% of total sales in the third quarter of 2012 and 7.4% in 2011. The increase in SG&A from the quarter ended September 30, 2011, was primarily due to higher profit- sharing expense, employee compensation, warranty and bad debt expenses. Operating income increased 18.1% to $10.4 million or 13.5% of sales from $8.8 million or 11.9% of sales. Our effective tax rate increased from 35% to 43% due to adjustments in the quarter. We expect the rate for the full year to be approximately 37%. Net income increased 6.8% to $6 million or 7.8% of sales from $5.6 million or 7.6% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.24 per share versus $0.23 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,667,000 shares versus 24,844,000 shares in the same quarter 1 year ago. The results of the 9 months ended September 30. Revenues were up 11% to $225.1 million from $202.8 million. Gross profit increased 37.6% to $51.8 million from $37.6 million. Gross profit, as a percent of sales, was 23% for the 9 months of 2012 compared to 18.6% in 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.5% to $19.6 million or 8.7% of sales during 2012 from $16.7 million or 8.2% of sales. Operating income increased 53.5% to $32.1 million or 14.3% of sales from $20.9 million or 10.4% of sales. Net income increased 51.5% to $19.9 million or 8.8% of sales from $13.1 million or 6.5% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.80 per share versus $0.53 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,722,000 shares versus 24,902,000 shares in the same period 1 year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, we see that we had a working capital balance of $54 million. Our current asset ratio was approximately 2.3 to 1. Our capital expenditures were approximately $13.4 million. Shareholders equity per share is $5.58 compared to $5.08. We paid cash dividends of $3 million, July 2012. The board declared the regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.12 per share. In addition, the board has declared a one-time special cash dividend of $0.12 per share. Both dividends will be paid to stockholders of record as of December 3, and payable December 24. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further details, along with the new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Despite a difficult environment, sales were up 4% for the quarter and 11% for the 9 months. Sales increased due to our ability to gain market share. We had a minimal price increase and we had redesigned products. Replacement market is very healthy and new construction market was relatively stable compared to the year ago. Geothermal continues to grow as a type of system. We continue to expand our chiller and air handler market, as well as our split system and floor-by-floor markets. However, the continuation of our basic product line, which is rooftops, continued to dominate our market. There was no particular physical market which expanded, and physical market, I mean, as far as building style. The replacement market continued to dominate as it did last year. And the continuation appears to be continuing into the fourth quarter, which is a little different than what I had expressed the last time we spoke. At which point in time, I thought the replacement market would start falling off in the fourth quarter. That does not appear to be occurring as much as we anticipated. In the type of business that we're in, the commercial and the retail are doing adequately well, not wonderfully. The office building is doing a little better. Medical and healthcare is doing fairly well; education is pretty much stable; manufacturing continues to show a little bit of life, however, from a very low level; lodging, municipalities and others continue to be pretty stable. However, again, the replacement market for all of these is the more healthy part of the business. Backlog, as of September 30, is $55,313,621 compared to $54,084,950, 1 year ago. Our incoming order rate has surpassed our previous expectations. Although it is not booming, it is going to give us a decent- looking fourth quarter. Gross margins, as a percent of sales, are as follows: Quarterly margin was 22% compared to 19% in 2011; the year-to-date margin is 23% compared to 19% in 2011; with SG&A, expenses of 8.8% for the quarter were 7.4% in 2011, and 8.7% for the 9 months compared to 8.2% for the similar 9 months in 2011. For the quarter and the year, warranty expense was increased because of the increase in sales, profit sharing, warranty, employee compensation and higher bad debt. Net income, which was up by 6.8% for the quarter and up 51.5% for the 9 months. In this area, I must mention that if you recall, in our first 6 months of last year, we had the roof collapse which caused us undue hardship last year, so the 51% -- 51.5% increase is not so much the growth this year as it is the lack of problems that we had last year. $6.6 million spent in the third quarter was the income in the third quarter of 2012 compared to $5.6 million in the third quarter of 2011. $19 million -- $19.9 million was our income in the first 9 months compared to 2011 of $13.1 million. Our balance sheet has gotten substantially improved, our liquidity position is much stronger and we held, in addition to the regular dividend, a special one-time dividend which was declared for the fourth quarter to be paid on sales, as mentioned by Scott, on stock, of record on December 3 and to be paid on December 24. The outlook for the remainder of 2012 appears that we have a little bit better backlog, as mentioned, than we had 1 year ago. So the backlog pretty much tells you what the volume is going to be. It's going to be a little better than last year, but it's not going to be booming. The gross margins are pretty much determined because we have most of what we're going to ship into the backlog already. There's no price increases that are going to occur and there is no great cost increases going to occur. So the gross margins will remain pretty much like the third quarter. The capital expenditures for 2012 have pretty much been finished, and although, we spent a little bit more than we had anticipated as primarily due to the amount of small items which we have bought, this is not significant items in the $13 million we spent. We only have 2 real significant items which were anticipated. One was a new sheet metal machine in our Longview facility and the other was for racks and storage devices in our text -- our Tulsa facility. The balance of the money was for a lot of miscellaneous things associated with the new buildings, and other things which we needed to complement to improve our products and our ability to build products. There will be a minimum amount due of additional capital expenditures, probably another million or so, that will be spent during the balance of the year. Now the outlook for next year is quite cloudy, as you probably recognize, because of the economic situation and the various problems confronting our economy. So as best we can tell right now, based upon the Architecture Billing Index, which indicates the amount of building to which were designed in the past few months and were expected to be built for the first 6 to 9 months of next year, most have already been designed. And based upon the Architecture Billing Index, we would anticipate a somewhat stable, neither growing nor declining market there. The other market, which is over 50% of our market, is the replacement market. And as I mentioned earlier, we got a bigger amount of replacement business in the fourth quarter for fourth quarter shipment than what we thought we would get. That could be being pull-forward from next year, but at this point in time, we don't believe that it's some significant amount of pull-forward, so we would anticipate the replacement market being fairly stable also. The net result is that we may get a little bit of growth by taking market share, and we don't anticipate any great amount of growth, and we do not foresee, at this point in time, any significant downturn. I'll now open to new questions. So Karl, would you come on and help us there?"
87,GV_021542_2013Q3,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the AAON's Third Quarter Report Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Norman Asbjornson. Please go ahead. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. Prior to moving forward, I want to read a disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. I'd like to now introduce Scott Asbjornson, our CFO, who will take over. Scott M. Asbjornson VP of Finance & CFO Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing the comparative results of the 3 months ended September 30, 2013, to September 30, 2012. Net sales were up 16.8% to $89.7 million from $76.8 million. Net sales increased due to gains in market share in the new commercial, industrial, construction and replacement markets as a result of price increases introduced in April 2013. Gross profit increased 55.2% to $26.6 million from $17.1 million. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 29.7% in the quarter just ended compared to 22.3% in 2012. The improvement in gross margins can be attributed to decreases in raw material costs and increased product prices. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 43.6% to $9.7 million from $6.7 million in 2012. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 10.8% of total sales in the third quarter of 2013 and 8.8% in 2012. The increase in SG&A from the quarter ended September 30, 2013, was primarily due to higher profit sharing expense, warranty and employee compensation. Income from operations increased 62.7% to $16.9 million, or 18.9% of sales, from $10.4 million or 13.5% of sales. Our effective tax rate decreased to 38.1% from 42.7% in the third quarter of 2012. The company had a return to provision adjustment in 2012 that caused the rate to be higher than expected in that period. We expect the rate for the balance of 2013 to be approximately 33.4%. Net income increased 75.2% to $10.5 million, or 11.7% of sales, from $6 million or 7.8% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.28 per share versus $0.16 per share. Diluted earnings per share were based on 37,018,000 shares versus 37,001,000 shares in the same quarter 1 year ago. The results of the 9 months ended September 30. Net sales were up 10.1% to $247.8 million from $225.1 million. Gross profit increased 34.4% to $69.6 million from $51.8 million. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 28.1% for the 9 months of 2013 compared to 23.0% in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 31.2% to $25.7 million, or 10.4% of sales, during 2013 from $19.6 million or 8.7% of sales primarily due to increases in profit sharing, warranty, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, professional fees, advertising and sales taxes. Income from operations increased 36.5% to $43.9 million or 17.7% of sales, from $32.2 million or 14.3% of sales. Our effective tax rate was 32.8% compared with 38.3% in the third quarter of 2012 due to discrete benefits related to the Research & Development Credit and the Indian Employment Credit. These federal credits were retroactively reinstated on January 2, 2013. No Research & Development Credit or Indian Employment Credit benefits were recorded in the 9 months ended September 30, 2012. Net income increased 49.9% to $29.8 million, or 12.0% of sales, from $19.9 million or 8.8% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.80 per share versus $0.54 per share. Diluted earnings per share were based on 37,042,000 shares versus 37,084,000 shares in the same period 1 year ago. At this time, I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Accounting Officer, Rebecca Thompson, to discuss the balance sheet. Rebecca A. Thompson Chief Accounting Officer & Treasurer Thank you, Scott. Looking at the balance sheet, you'll see that we have a working capital balance of $66 million. Our current asset ratio is approximately 2.5:1. Our capital expenditures for 2013 are approximately $6.4 million. Shareholder equity per diluted share is $4.37 at September 30, 2013, versus $3.73 at December 31, 2012. We have total cash and investments of $44.2 million at September 30, 2013, compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2012. We paid cash dividends of $3.7 million on July 2, 2013. And on November 6, 2013, the Board of Directors declared a regular semi-annual cash dividend of $0.10 per share, which will be paid to the holders of the outstanding common stock of the company as of the close of business on December 2, 2013, the record date, payable December 23, 2013. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with the new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Net sales were up 16.8% for the quarter and 10.1% for the 9 months. Sales increased due to our ability to gain market share. We had some price increase in March. We had this due to our redesigned -- our new redesigned products, and the breakdown between new construction and replacement, as near as we can tell, was pretty consistent as far as our increase in market share. The market, as it exists, however, the new construction market was, in total, the market that we serve, fairly well level. It did not -- it was not level across-the-board, however. And just to give you a feel for how it varied, the strongest part of the market was in the lodging arena in which, according to industry statistics, it went up 26.7%. However, that is one of our weaker markets, and it also is a smaller portion of the overall market. The other markets that were pretty much level were the office market and the commercial building market. One was up about -- or down about 0.1%, and the other one was up about 0.9%; the health care market, which was down about 5%; the educational market was down a little over 5%; and the religious, which again is a small market, was down about 17%. So if you take all the dollars associated with those various markets and look at them, they were virtually flat from year-to-year. Looking at AHRI statistics, which reports for the industry on the type of product sold, the amount that was sold in a given period, the most recent time available to me is the August report. And the August report shows in total, including residential, to be down 2%. If we break it down into the residential and commercial, which is fairly easily done, it appears that both of them contributed to that down. And so it looks like the replacement market was down more -- and the commercial world was down more than was the stability that was exhibited in the new construction. And therefore, all -- virtually all of our increase in sales had to be -- come from taking market share. It was not due to any market growth because there was none. Going into the types of markets we're in and what they -- how they looked, the type of product markets. We pretty much uniformly across all of our products had about -- that increase was distributed fairly reasonably between the rooftops, the chillers, air handlers, split systems and the packaged equipment. The one notable one that seemed to be weak was geothermals. The strongest thing we had, we are now getting much more serious in the parts sales. We've expanded our capability there to include parts other than those which are used on AAON products, and this has gained us some significant growth in our parts business and helped give us the 16%, 16.8% for the quarter and the 10.1% for the 9 months. The tone of the markets. We follow the markets basically by looking at the Architectural Billing Index, which has been up for 11 of the past 12 months. So it says that the buildings are being designed or there's money being spent on designing. The Architectural Building (sic) [Billings] Index says in its announcement that this predates the date of actual expenditure of the funds on these buildings by somewhere between 9 and 12 months. So since I'm calling out a 12-month time frame, one would have expected there to have been an upswing in the last 2 or 3 months. It might be happening. It's a very faint thing. It does appear to be starting to happen, but it is not a very significant happening. And since the amount of up that the Architect Billing Index was during that time frame was also rather small over the 50% or the uniform market, this kind of is consistent. So presumably, we will gain a little bit more strength as we go forward in the next few months, and that's the best index that I have that I know about to determine what's likely to happen. So I would have to say that the market -- the new construction market is starting to heal a little bit more and is likely to be up somewhat. The replacement market, however, is affected by a variety of other things. Probably the biggest effect on it was that for the previous 2 years, there was a federal tax ruling which allowed you to do 100% depreciation a couple years ago and then 50% depreciation on any capital goods which were bought. And that, I believe -- at the time we believed it, and I believe it's still true, brought quite a lot of replacement business into the marketplace over the past couple years. And it probably took some of that market away from the futures. They probably replaced some stuff that they wouldn't have replaced until this year. And that's probably why there's a little bit of weakness in the replacement market, as best I can see it now. That should get its way out of the market, and we should get more into the normal replacement market this coming year. So going forward, I don't think it's going to be a strong upswing, but I think there is a modest upswing in place. And connect that to our new products which are gaining strength and gaining market share to us and the new ones which we're going to be announcing over the next few months, I'm optimistic about the growth potential for AAON even in a very slightly improving marketplace. The backlog. Backlog needs to be understood a little bit. You know that this quarter that we just finished we had a very pronounced upswing of 16.8% for the quarter. What you're seeing here is attributable to the fact that we spent quite a lot of capital money the past few years improving our ability to build product. And habitually, we're in a marketplace where the second and third quarters are the strong quarters because that's when we normally ship a lot of equipment to the construction market due to the timing of the construction building cycle. We also have weak quarters in the first quarter and the fourth quarter. And in the past, we have had a little difficulty keeping up with the customers' needs when they really wanted the product, which was in the second and third quarters. However, now, with our increased capabilities, we had no problem keeping up. Therefore, what has actually occurred to us is a little bit of the market that we put into that 16.8% for the third quarter was actually removed out of the fourth quarter from us. A year ago or 2 or 3 years ago, it would have slipped into the fourth quarter simply because we could not have built all that we needed to have built. But this year, that was not the case. We built whatever they wanted built when they wanted it built. And so we have distorted, on a comparative basis, what happened in the third quarter this year and what will happen in the fourth quarter this year compared to last year. The new orders coming in have consistently been running ahead of 1 year ago. On a month-by-month basis, we've had great consistency on getting the new orders at a higher rate than we did in the corresponding month in the preceding year. Not a huge amount additional, but a significant amount. And significant, I mean, up in the -- around the 10% area. And we are still in that mode of getting that. However, with that being said, the amount of sales that we pulled out of the fourth quarter and put in the third quarter has made it such that we are not going to have as much revenue showing up probably in the fourth quarter this year as we had in the fourth quarter 1 year ago. It'll be somewhere up in there, but it probably won't be the same. However, due to the other factors which gave us the very strong profitability, those factors are still going to exist in the fourth quarter, and we will probably be at or above last year's profitability. So we're doing well. Everything is looking right. But there's a little distortion in the way the numbers are coming out. The gross margins. I've got several things running with them. Right now, we haven't, as we said, been experiencing basic cost increases in the way of material. We have had, of course, a slight amount of wage increases, but productivity has been reasonably well offsetting that. So the only big change that we expect to be occurring, which is going to happen over the next 6 months, is we are in the process of going into a new coil concept that is being introduced into our industry that will lower our cost of some of our coils, and that will give us a little less material cost probably being offset on the opposite side by a small amount of cost increase. So basically, there's nothing in the offing that I see to greatly change the gross profit we make on sales. Now, of course, if our volume is down, like it normally is in the fourth quarter and the first quarter compared to the second and third quarter, we won't be absorbing our fixed overheads as well, and that will have an effect upon the bottom line marginally. Capital expenditures for 2013, as we explained, were a little over $6 million thus far. We told you 1 year ago that we were going to -- and earlier this year that we were going to be between $8 million to $10 million for the year. That's still a reasonable number for expectation, that $6 million will probably move up in somewhere between the $8 million and the $10 million. Capital expenditures basically were for some equipment and finishing off some of the things we were underway on, on the building project from the preceding year, as well as we have started another new building project here in Tulsa that's underway at the present time and which won't finish until first quarter next year. The outlook, as I said earlier, for next year at this point in time looks to us to be slightly up in the market capabilities, what's out there in the marketplace looks to have healed itself and should have a little bit of positive to it. And our new products give us a definite edge to continue our taking of market share, as we have for the past 25 years. Operator, I'm open for questions."
88,GV_021542_2007Q4,"Presentation Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's AAON Incorporated fourth quarter and full year conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Norman Asbjornson. Please go ahead, sir. Norman Asbjornson Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us in our fourth quarter report and full year 2007. Before going forward, I'll have to read a forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented here in deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q. With that being completed, I'd like to introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. Kathy? Kathy Sheffield Good afternoon. Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing the results of the three months ended December 31. Our revenues were up 13.9% to $62.1 million from $54.6 million a year ago. Gross profit was up to 26.7% to $12.4 million from $9.8 million. Gross profit was 20% of sales during the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 18% of sales during the fourth quarter of 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the fourth quarter by 94% to $5.2 million or 8.4% of sales from $2.7 million or 4.9% of sales in 2006. Operating income increased 1.4% to $7.2 million or 11.6% of sales from $7.1 million or 13% of sales. Net income increased by 0.9% to $4.6 million or 7.4% of sales from $4.5 million or 8.3% of sales. The diluted EPS for both 2007 and 2006 was $0.24 per diluted share. These shares were calculated on 18.8 million shares in 2007 versus 18.9 million shares in 2006. Looking at the full year, revenues were up 13.4% to $262.5 million from $231.5 million. Gross profit increased to 30.7% to $57.4 million or 21.9% of sales from $43.9 million or 19% of sales in 2006. SG&A expenses increased for the year by 20.2% to $21.7 million or 8.3% of sales from $18.1 million or 7.8% of sales. The operating income increased 38.1% to $35.7 million or 13.6% of sales from $25.8 million or 11.2% of sales. Net income for the year increased 35.2% to $23.2 million or 8.8% of sales from $17.1 million or 7.4% of sales. The diluted EPS was $1.22 per share versus $0.90 per share a year ago. Earnings per share for the year were calculated on 18.9 million shares versus 19 million shares a year ago. Looking at the balance sheet now our current asset ratio decreased slightly. It was approximately 2.0 due to dividends payable and higher accrued liability which came from increased warranty and increased commission. Capital expenditures for the year were $10.9 million and related to increased equipment related to increase in production and sales efficiency, some innovations to our Tulsa facility. Our shareholders equity per share as of December 31, 2007 was $5.29 compared to $4.95 for the same period a year ago. We also paid cash dividends of $5 million and also bought back stock for a total of $20.8 million. I would now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, also along with our new products and our outlook for 2008. Norm? Norman Asbjornson Okay. The year of 2007 was a pretty strong year from an economy standpoint. The commercial building was strong; it grew well and we benefited from that. In addition to which, we did introduce additional new products, which were well received and grew very well for us, as did some of the renovated or new products to replace old products. Coupled with the fact that we did have price increases attributed to our inflation cost last year, it ended up giving us our total growth. Profitability, came about more by the fact that even though there was some volatility in component costs, it went both ways. In the early part of the year, it was on a downward trend and then in the latter part of the year it started an upward trend. And some [subsistence] from the whole year from the beginning to the end, inflation was up probably somewhere in 4% to 5% on our cost of material. So, it did give us a difference on a quarterly basis, because of the changing nature of the inflation. It does on a go forward basis, appear that we are getting a little bit more inflation coming our way than we had a year ago this time. Not appreciably, but certainly it is worth mentioning. As far as going through the types of products and what our results whereby of these various locations, the biggest product we build, the largest tonnage, the largest physical size, the most costly product, was one of our stronger growth products and it was one of our newer redesigned products and employs the latest technology we know to put into products. This latest technology to which I'm referring is the two inch double-wall foam construction cabinet and the direct driver for blower, both of them very energy related issues. Moving down into the next size of cabinet, which was also re-designed with the same attributes and was another large growth factor and then when we got into the smaller three sizes of cabinets, they grew but not as well as that of the two larger sizes of units. Moving out of that into the chiller arena, we have very nice growth in our chiller products in Tulsa and we began our Air Handling Units but they wanted a significant part of our volume, dollar volume. Moving on down to Longview Texas, we had very nice growth on our Air Handling Units down there, nice growth on our condensing units and everything is coming along pretty well down there. It's getting to be much more of an outside sales relationship compared to selling coils to Tulsa and therefore the value added is coming along well down there; the value added part of our sales and we're doing better on the bottom line down there. Moving to our Canadian facility, we are still troubled by problems we're having up there. We did during the year manage to get the functionality of all the things as far as running the company and our software systems are doing very well. That's a positive side of it. But on the weaker side of that, what's going on up there? We had still some catching up to do with our pricing of our product to get up to where we could make a profit on it, and we did manage to get that accomplished over the entire year, however we have lag effect. And the lag effect was primarily attributable to the very rapid change in the exchange rate between the Canadian dollar and the US dollar. When we would raise the price thinking we had ourselves in good shape, the dollar value would change faster than our price increase and we were just constantly playing catch-up with price increases. Now, that was not obviously the case on the market that we did in Canada because of course that was not an issue in the Canadian market but there was an issue here as what we sold into the United States and built in Canada and when we sold a product in the United States with US dollars thinking the exchange rate was going to be considerably bigger than Canadian dollars going from US$1 to say C$1.18. And then when we actually got around to shipping that, it had gone the other way, US$1 was only bringing us C $0.90 some cents or a dollar in Canadian. So the entire differential came right off the bottom-line of that company. So we had a very vicious cycle going on. It was further pyramided by the fact that we got a lot of orders in the early part of the year, which was good if today's dollar hadn't changed. It turned up to be very bad because we had always got low dollar- related orders; then we had to build after the exchange rate has changed on. It's there by destroying our bottomline. Net result, we still had a bad year in the Canadian facility. Near the end of the year and into this year,  we have gotten the price up on the US business to where now the price of the product we're selling is okay. We're making money on that. The question is and it's not a determined fact yet, is what effect thus raising our price by around 30% to the US customers have on our sales volume. Obviously, we had a very negative effect. Did it kill too much of our business force? We don't know yet. So, jury is still out on what effect the exchange rate has had on the viability of the Canadian facility. But it has been a challenging year, particularly, due to as I said the exchange rate. I spent a little extra time on this because of the fact that we've been talking about the fact that we thought we were going to have it solved last year and we did not get it solved. That's kind of where we've grow up, where we've been, where we're going. Now, then, what's happening to us for the future? I mentioned early on in the discussion that the large tonnage equipment in the US is done very well. We believe that the things we've done in our new product offerings are going to continue to gain market share at above the average rates. We are presently implementing a lot of changes in the smaller tonnage units, which haven't been updated for a number of years. We believe that's going to make them very much more attractive to the end users. We have gotten enough going that we're going to expand the Tulsa facility a little bit more because we feel we can improve our facility enough that the efficiency of manufacturing will offset the cost of building the additional facility. We have done a long range plan taking our Tulsa facility to what we consider the maximum that's available to us on the 53 acres, we own here. And we've set out a multiyear plan for working that as we grow. So, we know where we're going. Over a one-year investigation has been completed on that and the planning has been pretty well completed. Moving down to Longview. Longview is perhaps the biggest unknown thing we've got because most of the product down there is, either brand new or relatively new, and some of it has tremendous upsides. The question is how much of the upside can we actually make happen. The air handlers that we put into place there in past years or so are into a marketplace that is very large and we're just getting started with it. The smaller air handlers we've had there for a number of years are doing very well and growing very nicely as are the smaller condensing units. When we get over to the smaller condensing units, as you know, we've been trying to get ourselves straightened up where we could market our smaller condensing units into the residential market. As you probably all are well aware that the residential market is anything but a desirable place to be right now. So how fast or how much will happen in our efforts and that remains to be seen, but we are embarking upon it and we are seriously going after the replacement part of the air conditioning part of the residential market, which is an immense market. So, as I said early on here, the big unknown on the upside is Longview. It has a very little downside unknown, but it has a huge upside unknown. Moving up to the Canadian facility, I told you where we are. Basically it's still a question mark about the viability of that operation. We know we can get enough money for the product, we know how to build something that will make profit there, the question is can we get enough business to make the company profitable at that price level? And it's not to say all problems are cured up there, they are not. But they are within manageable means to go forward and the real question in that operation comes down to availability of orders at the price we have to have in the US. And over 80% of our business for that factory comes out of the US. That pretty well wraps up my part of the discussion. I would like to open the talk up now to questions from the listeners. Hello?"
89,GV_021542_2010Q4,"Presentation Operator Welcome to AAON's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Sales and Earnings Conference Call. I will now turn it over to your host, Mr. Asbjornson. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our 2010 year and our fourth quarter report. Before beginning, I'd like to read our forward-looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained on our most recent Securities Exchange Commission filings including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. I'd like now to introduce our Vice President and CFO, Kathy Sheffield, who will give you the numbers. Thank you. Kathy? Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome you to our call also. I'll begin today by discussing the quarterly results for the three months ended 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Our revenues were up 21.4% to $65.8 million from $54.2 million. Our revenues increased due to a gain in additional market share primarily as a result of the favorable reception of our new products and also to increased market share. Gross profit decreased 4% to $14.2 million from $14.8 million. Gross profit was 21.6% of sales during Q4 compared to 27.3% of sales during Q4 of 2009. Our gross profit percentage has decreased due to the absence of a derivative that we benefited from in 2009, cost increases led by commodity prices and our inability to implement price increases given the economic environment that we are in. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14.2% to $5.9 million, or 8.9% of sales, during the fourth quarter from $5.2 million, or 9.5% of sales. The increase was primarily due to increased bad debt expense and selling-related expenses. Operating income decreased to 13.7% to $8.3 million, or 12.6% of sales, from $9.6 million, or 17.8% of sales. Net income decreased 6.1% to $5.8 million, or 8.8% of sales, from $6.2 million, or 11.4% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.35 per share versus $0.36 per share a year ago. Earnings per share were based upon 16,633,000 shares versus 17,281,000 shares at the same quarter a year ago. The results of the 12 months where annual revenues were substantially level with the prior year with only a slight 3.3% decrease to $244.6 million from $245.3 million in 2009. Gross profit decreased 18.3% to $55.2 million from $67.5 million. Our gross profit was 22.6% of sales for the 12 months of 2010 compared to 27.5% in 2009. In addition to the reason we mentioned in the quarterly discussion, gross profit was affected by onetime costs associated with relocation of production lines and also the addition of production facilities. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.5% to $22.5 million, or 9.2% of sales, from $23.8 million, or 9.7% of sales. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in profit-sharing related to a lower net income. Operating income decreased 25.2% to $32.7 million, or 13.4% of sales, from $43.8 million, or 17.8% of sales. Net income decreased 21% to $21.9 million, or 9% of sales, from $27.7 million, or 11.3% of sales. Diluted EPS was $1.30 per share versus $1.60 per share. Earnings per shares were based on 16,893,000 shares versus 17,309,000 shares for the same period a year ago. Our effective tax rate decreased from 37% to 33% due to an increase in the domestic production activity tax credit from 6% to 9%, higher R&D credits than we anticipated and other domestic credits. We expect that our effective rate to be in the range of 33% to 35% for 2011. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that we continue to have a strong liquidity position of $2.4 million in cash and no long-term debt. Our current ratio was 2.5:1. Capital expenditures were $17.5 million for manufacturing and equipment purchases and costs to expand our manufacturing facility at the Tulsa location. Shareholders' equity per share is $7.07 compared to $6.85 for 2009. We paid cash dividends of $9.2 million in 2010. I'd now like to turn the call over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail along with new products and then the outlook for 2011. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you, Kathy. The increase of 21% in the light fourth quarter in 2010 plus 2009 should also be noted that the marketplace as we near as we can tell was down approximately 14% last year compared to 2009. So what it really meant is we took about 35% of our sales from our competitors in that quarter. So we had quite a remarkable increase in market share last quarter. The new products are now pretty well all introduced as far as the rooftops are concerned. And now we've turned our attention over to chilled water systems and chillers, and we're introducing our new products in that area. Broadening our reach into the applied products as opposed to the unitary, where we have historically been. Looking at what the business situation looks like this year, it looks to us like there's going to be a modest increase, but it looks like it's going to be primarily in the latter half of the year, with one possible major exception. The laws passed at the very end of 2010, the Tax Relief Act, which allows 100% depreciation of certain qualified assets and capital goods. And that we believe it may have a big impact upon people's replacement business of air conditioners. If that comes into being, it should happen relatively soon and perhaps is already beginning to happen as is reflected by our increase in new orders compared to a year ago. Looking at the general nature of the various building classifications, I'll just give you a quick rundown of my perception of it. Commercial and retail just isn't good at all. Office buildings, a little better but not much. Medical and healthcare is pretty good. Education is pretty good. Manufacturing is not. Lodging is not real good. Municipalities, in other words, more governmental buildings, is fairly good. In general, all other buildings is just a tough market. We think that from our peak in 2008, our general building, new building market is down over 50%. The one salvation in that, of course, is the fact that approximately half of our business or a little bit more now comes from replacement market and the replacement has moderated that downturn in new construction. And as I said, if this Tax Relief Act of 100% depreciation on qualified capital goods really talks to other people as it does to me, we may have a much better year coming up right now than anybody really realizes and than anything that I have seen predicted. Our new products have been very, very warmly received, as you can see by our results in the fourth quarter. I believe that is going to continue on and so we fully anticipate continued increasing of market share. Looking at what else is going on, we've done extremely well last year in our Longview facility on split systems, which is air handlers and condensing units. Those had a remarkable growth throughout the entirety of last year and that continues. Unfortunately, it's not as big enough number to have as big an impact to total and absolute numbers as it does as a percentage of growth. The percentage growth is quite remarkable. So the split systems, the new split systems we introduced a couple of years ago have really found a willing customer base. The backlog is also indicative of upturn. In the end of 2010, our backlog was $38,370,000 compared to a year, I mean, excuse me, that was compared to a year ago where it was, just a minute, compared to a year ago of $32,150,302. The incoming order rates, while it's been quite good so far, we anticipate it could definitely be impacted by a product show, which we held on January 31 in Las Vegas in conjunction with our industry-wide HRAI [ph] show. We took about $1,500,000 worth of equipment out to the show. Everybody that I spoke with and all the reports we've gotten back has been, what we showed at the show was extremely well received and we definitely expect to get a increased amount of business due to this show. We don't, however, expect that to happen very suddenly because most of the people we were showing it to are the consulting engineers, who if they felt good about it and went back, they specify this on buildings yet to be built. And between the specifying and the time that we actually ship equipment is somewhere around six months usually. So we expect the summer to be impacted by the show that we had in Las Vegas. The margins have been diminishing, we haven't had a general price increase since early in 2008. We did have a price increase in November on our split systems out of Longview. 5% price increase, it went through very well. Did not disrupt our order flow very much. We have a variable price increase, which is going to go into effect at the end of this month, on the 31st of March. And that is variable by various components in the units, so I can't tell you it's a flat number because it is not. I think as a general rule, it is around 5% that we will get as an increase. But that again will not find its way to our bottom line until the very end of the second quarter or possibly the third quarter, since we have to work through all the backlog before we get to that price increase. We do anticipate the continuation of commodity costs increases. The United States no longer is a big factor in a lot of the commodities. They are really world product. And as such, the world's doing better in the recovery than the United States, and so the commodity prices have already been going up and I expect them to continue going up. We did not, unfortunately, have the ability to have a derivative this year in 2010, nor do we have any in the offing at the present time. We're strictly in the market at the costs of whatever it happens to be today. Although I think it's going up, I don't have enough confidence in that statement that I want to go out and go into the future on it. All of our materials have increased over the past year by a fairly large percentages. For instance, copper has gone up by $2.03 as an average from down in the $2 a pound to the $3 or $4 and something a pound. Steel didn't go up so much dollar-wise, but percentage-wise, it went up quite a bit from about $0.40 a pound to about $0.45 a pound. In other words, about a 10% or 11% increase. Aluminum also didn't go up so much dollar-wise but as a percent, it was pretty large. We basically went up from down around $1 a pound up to about $1.70 something or $1.80 a pound at the end of 2010. So about a 60%, 70% increase on aluminum. That's really the driving force because a lot of our components that we buy from vendors are made of those materials and so the vendor prices for components has also increased. We have been fortunate in the past three years to have been able to improve productivity consistently. And, therefore, moderate the effect of the cost increases on our profitability. I believe that is going to continue to go, and we'll be that same way for the rest of this year and for the foreseeable future. The big difference at the present time is perhaps what I mentioned a little bit ago about the Tax Relief Act, which was passed on December of 2010. When that got passed, it appeared to me to be an absolute windfall for anybody needing to buy capital goods. And, therefore, we accelerated a lot of our capital goods buying in 2011, which we normally wouldn't have done until 2012, and we've increased it by about over 50% to where our capital expenditures this year will be in the vicinity of $28 million, $29 million, $30 million. And what we're basically doing is we had six of our sheet metal fabricating machines that had run a long ways, they had anywhere from 70,000 hours running up into the high 90,000 hours. And if you recognize in the 360 day year, we have 8,760 hours, you kind of get a feeling of how many hours those machines had on them. We run our machines quite heavily, and so we get a lot of use out of them every year. But we basically decided we would replace those machines this year, and that is going to occur. They will be replacing the older machines with all those work hours on them throughout the entire year clear up and then to December of this year. So it won't hit us at any one given time in particular, it will be across the entire spectrum of the year. The outlook for 2011. We anticipate that we're going to have growth this year. We will anticipate we'll have improved profitability this year. A lot of it is going to depend upon how effectively we do all of the implementation of the various capital issues that we have going on. We have at the present time a little over 200,000 square feet of additional building under construction. That building is primarily for warehouse facility, which we've been in bad need of for several years. We've had stuff stored outside, which should not have been outside and we'll be bringing that in. It will also allow us to become more effective in the sale of parts. And our parts business runs roughly $1 million a month. And we anticipate when we get the new facility in place, it won't happen this year, it will have no effect on us this year. But next year being 2012, we expect to have a fairly sizable increase in our parts business due to putting this warehouse in place. In addition to which the efficiency in the whole operation will improve, and I'm sure we've got a loss factor that will be lessened once we get everything in the warehouse. So things are looking brighter for us this year. But they're certainly going to struggle with a very weak marketplace we believe for the balance of the year. That pretty much concludes my formal presentation, So I'll open it to questions at this point in time."
90,GV_021542_2011Q4,"Presentation Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. I'm Norman Asbjornson reporting on AAON's investor conference call for the fourth quarter and the year 2011. Prior to going forward, I'd like to read a disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filing on Form 10-K. Thank you. I would like introduce Kathy Sheffield, our CFO. Kathy I. Sheffield Former Senior VP of Administration & Treasurer Good afternoon, and welcome to our conference call. Thank you for joining us for this review of AAON's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2011. I'll begin by discussing the comparative results of the 3 months ended December 31, 2011, to December 31, 2010. Our revenues were down 4% to $63.4 million from $65.8 million. The decrease in revenues can be contributed to 10 less production days due to plant shutdowns associated with the holidays and to a decline in orders from customers who were not able to receive their orders before the year end to take advantage of that Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act for equipment that was put into service in 2011. Our gross profit decreased 39.1% to $8.6 million from $14.2 million. As a percentage of sales, gross profit for the quarter was 13.6% compared to 21.5% a year ago. In addition to the lower productivity that we just discussed, the gross margin for the quarter was also affected by several other factors: Inefficient sheet metal production due to changing out of approximately 50% of our capacity in a short period of time in order to have our new equipment that we installed in the fourth quarter operable by the end of the year, numerous costs expensed during the change out of the equipment, inefficiencies in production due to lack of sheet metal parts in a timely fashion, costs associated with relocating 3 assembly lines and rearranging 2 other assembly lines, a continuation of component part price increases that we were any unable to fully pass on to our customers, and manufacturing inefficiencies due to the introduction of new products. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly 4.1% to $5.6 million or 8% of sales from $5.8 million or 8.9% of sales. Operating income decreased by approximately 85% to $1.2 million or 1.9% of sales from $8.3 million or 12.6% of sales. In addition to the previous discussion, operating income was impacted by a $1.8 million loss on the trade-in of equipment. Net income decreased to 85% to $0.9 million or 1.4% of sales from $5.8 million or 8.8% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.04 per share versus $0.23 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,821,000 shares versus 24,950,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. As we discussed the results for the full year ended December 31, we're pleased to report that our revenues were up 9% to $266.2 million from $244.5 million. This was accomplished by gaining market share as a result of that favorable reception to our new products and also by the signing into law the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act for qualified capital investments. Gross profit decreased 16.1% to $46.3 million from $55.2 million. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 17.4% for the year ended 2011 compared to 22.6% in 2010. In addition to the quarter details, year- to-date margins were also impacted by the loss of production for 8.5 days in February and production inefficiencies throughout October due to the building damage caused by the snowstorm and also by increases in raw material and component parts throughout the year. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $22.3 million or 8.4% of sales from $22.5 million or 9.2% of sales. The decrease as a percent of sales was primarily due to lower profit sharing, which was the result of a decrease in earnings, which was offset by an increase in salaries, employee benefits, selling related expenses and professional fees. Operating income decreased 32.2% to $22.2 million or 8.3% of sales from $32.7 million or 13.4% of sales. Other income and expense was adversely affected by a $500,000 insurance deductible related to the building damage from the snowstorm. Our effective tax rate increased from 33% to a normalized 35% due to the fewer federal tax credits that we received in 2011. Net income decreased 36.1% to $13.9 million or 5.3% of sales from $21.9 million or 9% of sales. Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 per share versus $0.87 per share. Earnings per share was based on 24,881,000 shares versus 25,339,000 shares for the same period a year ago. Moving to the balance sheet, we see that we had a working capital balance of $45.7 million. Our current asset ratio was 2:1. We created a tax refund of $10 million, which will have a positive impact on our liquidity as refunds are converted to cash in 2012. Our capital expenditures were $35.9 million. We had no long-term debt. Shareholders' equity per share was $4.92 compared to $4.61, and we paid cash dividend of $5.9 million in 2011. I would now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail along with the new products and our outlook for 2012. Norm? Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. I can only say that this was a very interesting year we just finished. We started the year out thinking we were going to invest approximately $10 million in capital expenses and then in December, when the government allowed us to start 100% depreciation on things, it turned our whole world upside down and it never stopped for the balance of the year for a variety of reasons. The beginning thing that hit us right away of course was the fact that the market did not improve appreciably during the year. It had a little more decline in it, and the market of which I speak is the building markets that we're serving. Now that market is the lodging building type buildings, office buildings, commercial buildings, health care buildings, educational buildings, religious buildings and manufacturing projects and then another all- inclusive group called other types of buildings. Net was in a continuing downswing start which started in 2008 and included in being almost flat between 2010 and 2011, but it still was in declining during that time period. Now I would like to talk just a little bit about the various things which we did during the year. Let us talk about the equipment, first of all. That's where everything in our world starts is our equipment. As we have been talking for several years, we've been on a very determined goal of accelerating as much as possible during this downturn, the development of a new product, several new products. We've gone through the number of products right now, approximately 70% of our volume is in those new products, which we've developed over the last 3 or 4 years. And we're in the process now of working on the final 30%, most of which will be concluded this year. That brought us to the point where we determined that we were being very successful with this product line. It was being well received by the product customers and in spite of the down trend in our business opportunities, we were gaining market share. And so when the government allowed us to take 100% depreciation, we did some calculations and concluded it was very optimal for us to take advantage of that even though the machines that we were going to obsolete weren't totally worn out although they were very, very badly worn because they had between 60-some thousand working hours and almost 100,000 working hours give you a point of that reference, one year has 8,760 hours in it. So we indeed had put a lot of hours on those machines. But they were still functional and they were as you would expect, a little slower because they were older machines and they did break down reasonably often. But we were going to obsolete them over the next 2 to 3 years beyond that but with that offer by the government, we decided to obsolete all of them right away. However, when we did that, we did not know that at that point whether we were going to keep those old machines or whether we were going to trade them in. We got a trade-in price from the vendor of the new equipment and then we ordered that new equipment with the option to trade in the old equipment with no commitment made at the time we ordered the new machinery. So they were still trying to get our hands around how we were going to do all this because even though it was highly beneficial to us, we had a few options that we could use on those old machines. The options were we could leave them where they were and put the new machines in our West building where we have enough room to put those machines in or we could extract the old machines from the building and sell them on our own or we could trade them in. As it turned out, we didn't finally and made a final determination to trade them in until the fourth quarter of this past year at which point in time, we finally decided that the only reasonable thing for us to do is to trade them in even though they haven't been fully depreciated and have a little bit over $1.8 million worth of undepreciated assets more than what we got on the trade-in value. That being said, we had also committed to a fairly sizable, roughly a little over 200,000 square foot addition to the facility in the Longview and also in the Tulsa facility and we were embarked upon that. All of this was compounded by a snowfall we had in the first week of February that took down about 24,100 square feet of our roof in 4 different sections. And when we lost the roof, we lost some of it on the East plant and most of it on West plant. This made the facilities open to the outside air and we hit some 20 below weather concurrent with the snowstorm, which obviously gave us a freezing condition inside the buildings on the east -- or the west side. The east side, we were able to contain it enough that we didn't lose the temperature down to below freezing. But we went well below freezing on the west building, which caused equipment damage, plumbing damage, you name it, we had it damaged, and we had no ability to heat the building. And so for 8.5 days, we were shut down totally. And when we got back up, we had no temperature control in the west building. We had managed to contain the damage on the east building, but the people which -- our west building is our larger structure. We're basically working in outdoor where air conditions is very close to it. And it was still quite cold in February. And then it went in to the summertime and it got hot and the heat not only made it bad for our employees, but the machinery, the sheet metal machinery has high temperature limits and it started shutting down on us. And so on a real hot day, we'd have machines go down and we couldn't get them running with both hands on them and things like that to get them back up but it was rather a challenging environment we lived through. All that being said, we did still manage to pull off the second best sales year that we've ever had. But the one part that really took a real beating was the bottom line because we had all these extraneous costs that we haven't anticipated and really money at which we had no control over which beat up on us on the financial side. So I'm very proud of the employees of AAON because I think they did a superb job of getting us through last year. Where we are today is all that is behind us. The building is behind us. All of the big transitions we've been making are almost all behind us. The only one which is still in progress at this point in time is the building, the major building we built was some office, additional office space, which was no problem because we aren't needing that anyway. But the other thing which we do badly need is the warehouse. The warehouse is finished as far as the building is concerned, but as far as the interior is concerned, we have probably 6 months left of finishing the floor, finishing the ceiling, wiring it, putting in racks and stocking all the racks. And so that portion will be ongoing until sometime in the latter summer before we really start getting beneficial use of that. That will add to our productivity of our operation when we finally get there. However, we will have a cash drain on us between now and then. However, the really stupendously good thing that did occur to us is our business stayed up fairly well. In the first 7 months of last year, we booked orders at a rate 19% better than what we had the previous year. So we were feeling quite good, and then they started diminishing. And the bookings we were having, we concluded were primarily due to government's 100% depreciation on certain capital goods and the people who were ordering it like we did our machinery early in the year and as the year went on, they ordered less and less and it diminished until end of fourth quarter they weren't ordering any of it and we were pretty well running out of it, the orders that we had. And that resulted -- we were up 19% in orders compared to 2010 through August and then we started going behind. And by the time we finished, the last 5 months of the year, we booked 9% less business than we did in 2010. So that gave us a problem of products that we could ship, build and ship in fourth quarter of last year, as well as all of our other problems which compounded, including the fact that the equipment, the majority of the equipment we ordered from our sheet metal machinery dealer, all of it aligned in the fourth quarter. They were not able to give us some in the first third quarters as was originally promised. And so we had basically 50% of our sheet metal equipment to be changed out in the fourth quarter and trying not losing any production time. That was a real challenging thing for our employees and they came through very well. But it did definitely impact us in innumerable ways. We are, as I said, totally through that. We had to have them all up and operating by the end of the year, which we did. And so consequently, the 100% depreciation allowance is allowed to us and we have not collected that money yet. The money will be collected this year, it's $7.8 million and we have another $2.2 million worth of other items, which also gave us tax credits. So we have a total of $10 million coming, going into this year of tax credits. We will be using some of them, but we are and have filed a request for the money back. We don't know how fast that will be acted upon so we don't know that. Due to the various things we have to do to file our income tax, we won't get the income tax filed until April. So if they don't refund it on the paperwork we've already submitted, I would presume we'll get it in May or June. The nice thing of it is of course, that throughout this -- excuse me for having this kind of a raspy throat here -- throughout this time frame, we've been able to keep our inventory under control for the year in total. As we told you in the past, we pre-bought a lot of things to try and offset cost increases on them and we pretty well used them all up during the year so that our inventory was pretty well back. We had very good receivables. We got our receivables in excellent condition. And so the problems were the ones which we've been enumerating to you so far. The net result is that going into this year, we were not booking business well because the replacement market was just kind of dead for the last 5 months. It was diminishing in December, it got very dead. And the first 10 days of January wasn't real great either. And then the new orders really started kicking in and they really came in. We have had this phenomenal order input and so the question arises, why did you have a phenomenal order input? We've had a lot of discussions around here and there, basically 3 things that we believe to be possibilities. Looking first of all at the architect's billing index and knowing that somewhere between, according to them, 9 months and 12 months go by from the time that they bill something, work that the architects, do before it gets out and gets bid on and started to being built. So you can look at an architect's billing index as we do all the time and see there was no upswing in the billings. So 9 to 12 months down the road, there's not going to be any big upswing in buildings being built because they weren't designed. So we know that isn't where it came from. So then where does it come from? Well, some of those buildings that were built are designed maybe several months ago or years ago possibly and never put under contract, were brought off the shelf this year and put under contract. That is a very real and probable thing because there is more optimism in the society right now and so that's highly likely that there was some of that. The next thing is that the winter has been a very open winter. So some of the business that we wouldn't normally expect to see until springtime, we probably have already started seeing it coming in, and that, we believe is a real potential. And the third thing is that our new product is being very, very well received by the customers, by the salespeople and everyone involved and they are just getting a bigger share of the market. Due to the magnitude of the input of the orders that we have received in the first 2 months of this year and are continuing to receive, I would give credit to all 3 scenarios, but I would give the dominance of credit to the new products' reception in the marketplace. So if that is the dominant thing, it's reasonable to expect a continuation of that order input. If we were counting on the other 2 items, those things are a one time sort of event and they have already come and gone probably. So we will see as we go forward whether the third option is the one that really is the real word for why we are doing so well on the bookings. I wouldn't tell you the total percentage bookings because it's unreal and I'd lose credibility with you. So all I'll say is we gave you the sum of where we were on March 1 and it is quite satisfying in our part in here. As I said and as continuing, there was one thing that you have to recognize, that has to be realized, is we had another couple of price increases during that time frame and with those price increases, you'll always get an influx of orders so that they beat the price increase. So of that $55.3 million that was in here on March 1, probably about 90% of it was pre-price increase because the price increase occurred in the February time frame and the orders that came in after the price increase is probably about 10% of that backlog. So we have to work out somewhere of around 40-some million dollars worth of it at the old price level. However, I'll also tell you that at the old price level, we are able to manage to get over the 20% margin on our standard gross margin. So it will have a material effect in that sense. Last year, we were only 17.4% on our gross margin for the yearend total. So we've already realized one month of other business at the higher margin that was in price increases that were done last year not this year. And we would, like I would say have another price increase in February which brought in some of that business. So we've got a lot of things going that could explain that input of business. And that result is we're very optimistic around here that it may not be as wonderful a situation going forward, but we're still quite optimistic that it's going to be a very good situation considering the marketplace. I spoke a little bit earlier about the architect's billing index and I'm sitting looking at one of their indexes right now and as I look at it that and I go back say to 2010 and look forward through the entire year of 2011, and try and project that into the next 12 months of orders or the balance of 2012 and what I'm seeing there is that it's sort of a stable situation as far as how many hours were billed for by the architects in designing buildings, which is probably the best index I know of in the building industry to say what's going to happen in the commercial building market. Since we're talking commercial, recognize we're not really seriously in the residential market and so I'm not talking all about the residential market. The market being stable then, the question comes about well, what can you really expect if that's the true case what can you expect based upon your historicals and project it forward? Well, let me walk you through a little bit of history. From 2003 to 2008, in those buildings that I mentioned, those various building types, the growth in dollars spent according to the U.S. government was construction spending over those period between 2003 and 2008 in those building types went up 64%. AAON sales during 2003 to 2008 went up 88%. So there was a 14% differential in the growth, which was -- had nothing else really be material there other than we took up much market share. Now, starting in 2008 and going through 2011, the market, by those same statistics, declined by 37%. AAON sales declined by 5%. In other words, we somewhere around doubled our market share taking during the downturn. So our salespeople did a fantastic job of promoting our new products and doing the things necessary to make that happen. Now if you look at it, you'll see that we went down in 2008 to 2009. We went flat from 2009 to 2010 and we went modestly up between 2010 and 2011. And I've already told you what's happening to our order input. So even with a flat sequence in the building of those buildings, which is what we anticipate, we still will expect that, that growth of market share taking that we're experiencing for the past 3 years is going to continue, which is about the difference between a 37% decline on the construction side and AAON's 5% decline or a 32% difference over a 3-year time frame there. Well, the other factor which someone is probably going to raise, what about -- isn't replacement market a major part of your business? And yes, it is. It's somewhere we think last year a little more than 50%. Well, how does that work into this? I know of no statistics that tell us anything on replacement market. So I can only assume that it somewhat tracks new construction. That may not be correct. But at any rate, we did take significant additional market share between 2008 and 2011. We anticipate that is going to continue in 2012. So with the flat market in the building industry, we expect to grow at a reasonable percent maybe getting up into the double digits that is hard to say. Does anybody have any questions at this point in time?"
91,GV_021542_2012Q4,"Presentation Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Good afternoon. Norman Asbjornson here for AAON. Before I go on forward, I'd like to read the forward- looking disclaimer. To the extent any statement presented herein deals with information that is not historical, including the outlook for the remainder of the year, such statement is necessarily forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. As such, it is subject to the occurrence of many events outside AAON's control, that could cause AAON's results to differ materially from those anticipated. Please see the risk factors contained in our most recent SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K and the quarterly report on Form 10-Q. I'd like to introduce Scott Asbjornson now, our CFO, who will take over. Scott M. Asbjornson VP of Finance & CFO Welcome to our conference call. I'd like to begin by discussing our comparative results of the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, to December 31, 2011. Revenues were up 23% to $78 million from $63.4 million. Revenues increased due to gains in market share in the non-residential and replacement markets, and also as a result of price increases introduced earlier in the year. Gross profit increased 116.6% to $18.7 million from $8.6 million. As a percentage of sales, gross profit was 24% in the quarter just ended, compared to 13.6% in 2011. The improvement in gross profit can be attributed to changes in commodity costs, increased product prices, improved product mix and productivity. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 18.2% to $6.6 million from $5.6 million in 2011. As a percentage of sales, SG&A was 8.5% of total sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 8.8% in 2011. The dollar basis increase in SG&A from the quarter ended December 31, 2011, was primarily due to higher profit sharing expense, employee compensation and stock-based compensation. Operating income increased 889.7% to $12.1 million or 15.5% of sales from $1.2 million or 1.9% of sales. In 2011, the company had a loss of $1.8 million on the trade in of old equipment. Also, the fourth quarter of 2011 included nonrecurring charges such as inefficient sheet metal production due to the changing out of approximately 50% of our capacity in a short period of time, in order to have our new equipment operable by the end of the year. Numerous costs expensed during the change out of the equipment, inefficiencies in production due to lack of sheet metal parts in a timely fashion and costs associated with relocating 3 assembly lines and rearranging 2 other assembly lines. Our effective tax rate increased from 35% to 37% due to adjustments in the quarter. Net income increased 770% to $7.6 million or 9.7% of sales from $0.8 million or 1.4% of sales. The increase is due to the reasons already discussed in operating income. Diluted earnings per share was $0.31 per share versus $0.04 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,630,000 shares versus 24,821,000 shares in the same quarter a year ago. The results of the year ended December 31. Revenues were up 13.9% to $303.1 million from $266.2 million. Gross profit increased 52.3% to $70.5 million from $46.3 million. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 23.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to 17.4% in 2011. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.7% to $26.3 million or 8.7% of sales during 2012 from $22.3 million or 8.4% of sales. Operating income increased 99.5% to $44.2 million or 14.6% of sales from $22.2 million or 8.3% of sales. Net income increased 96.3% to $27.4 million or 9.1% of sales from $14 million or 5.3% of sales. Diluted earnings per share is $1.11 per share versus $0.56 per share. Earnings per share were based on 24,699,000 shares versus 24,881,000 shares in the same period a year ago. Moving to the balance sheet. We see that we had a working capital balance of $51.9 million. Our current asset ratio was approximately 2.3:1. Our capital expenditures were approximately $14.1 million. At December 31, 2011, the company had $3.8 million of capital expenditures and accounts payable that are included in the cash outflows of $14.1 million for 2012. Shareholders' equity per diluted share is $5.59, compared to $4.92. We paid cash dividends of $8.8 million in 2012. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Norm, who will discuss our results in further detail, along with the new products and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Norman H. Asbjornson Founder, Chairman & CEO Thank you. Despite a very difficult environment in which sales or opportunities within our industry were approximately flat to slightly down, our sales were up to 23% in the quarter and 14% for the year. All of this was primarily due to the following [indiscernible] things which occurred with us. We increased our market share considerably. We did have some price increases. These were done -- the increase in sales were primarily the result of redesigned products and new, improved sales offices. Our replacement market, versus new construction, continued to be this dominant force. In other words, replacement market was approximately 55% or 56% of our total sales. Geothermal, which has been doing very well recently, continued to do well. However, it has been impacted by the dramatic decrease in the cost of natural gas. So it lends a little bit more questionability to geothermal going forward. Chillers and air-handlers continue to slightly gain market, as did split systems. In addition to which, our new 4x4, which is designed primarily for the very high-rise buildings with 30, 40, 50, 60 or more stores -- stories, continued to gain market share. However, that type of office building has not been very prevalent for the past year. Looking at various market segments to determine where we're getting our business. Commercial and retail has been relatively flat to slightly positive. Office buildings did experience a fairly substantial upswing to somewhere in the 8% or 9%. Medical and health buildings, however, were flat to slightly negative. Education was definitely negative, with perhaps a decrease of as much as 5%. Education, it should be noted here, is the largest single source of our business. It virtually doubles the size of any other larger market building type that we have. Manufacturing continued to gain and gained perhaps 5% during the year. Margin was up significantly, up to perhaps 11%. But if you put all the total dollars together and said, ""What does that give you in the net?"" It says it was flat to possibly down a little bit, or up a little bit. It's very questionable as to whether it was up or down. Going forward and looking and seeing what some of our other our indexes were, our backlog at 12/31 of '12 was $43,570,000 versus $43,993,000. In other words, basically a push at the ends of the years. Incoming order rate, that has occurred so far in 2013 compared to 2012, is down approximately $3.5 million from a year ago. Gross profit on sales went up last year, 24%, compared to 14%, and year-to-date, was up 23%, compared to 17% in 2011. SG&A as a percent, as was noted before, went down to 8.5% from 8.8% in 2011. For the year 2012, the incoming order rate or incoming business for the first 2 months of the year of last year compared to the first 2 months of this year, as I noted, had an incoming order rate 3.5% less. However, on the better side of that, we did have a marginal price increase and a profit increase in our sales. This offset this somewhat little decline in the volume. For the year, as a whole, going forward into 2013, we are still anticipating a flat-to-slightly-rising market share. So although we have experienced a little bit of slackness in the incoming orders in the first 2 months of the year, it's anticipated this is picking up and will, for the year as a whole, give us an up -- a slight upswing. Most of that upswing we expect to start seeing in the latter part of the year. However, the first quarter will continue, as we see it right now, to be very profitable. Net income last year for the quarter -- the fourth quarter, compared to a year ago, was up 770%, compared to 96.3%, up for the year. The 76% -- $76 million up in the fourth quarter compared to $0.9 million in 2011 and for the year as a total, it was $27.4 million compared to $14 million. If you remember, back in 2011, we did a huge amount of change within the company and we paid a price for it. However, we benefited from it in 2012 and we will continue to benefit going forward in 2013 and future years because we basically moved things that would normally be done over about a 3-year timeframe all into the year 2011. We've increased our liquidity. We've given a special onetime dividend last year. And the outlook for 2013, at present, we said our backlog was -- roughly comparable at the end of 2012 to the end of 2011. But on March 1, our backlog this year was $51.1 million compared to $55.3 million, March 1, 2012. So we have that $3.5 million, that I spoke of, that we've lost in orders so far in the first 2 months, is showing up directly in the backlog. Gross profit, as I've indicated, is however slightly better so far this year than it was last year. Capital expenditures, as mentioned before, I told you last year we would have about $8 million to $10 million in capital expenditures. And due to a carryover of unrecorded capital expenditures from 2011, we ended up with $14 million. But the actual commitments and outlays of new capital expenditures last year were slightly over $10 million. We expect to be in the $8 million to $10 million area again this year. I'd like to open it up now to questions. Claire [ph]?"
92,,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Aaron's Conference Call. At this time, I would like to pass the conference over to your host, Gil Danielson. Thank you, and have a great conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I'm going to have Garet Hayes, who does media relations for the company, to read our standard Safe Harbor statement that we do in front of every conference call. So Garet? Garet Hayes The company's news release issued Friday regarding the departure of Robin Loudermilk as Aaron's President and Chief Executive Officer and the related Form 8-K are available on our website, aaronsinc.com, in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived and replayed there as well. With us today is Ron Allen, the company's newly appointed Interim President and CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. As is our standard practice, before we begin, I would like read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the Risk Factors in the company's 2010 Annual Report on the Form 10-K including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings and store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. I will now turn the call over to Gil for a few comments. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you. As our press release Friday stated, Robin has resigned from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the company. Since that press release, I have had many calls regarding his resignation, and the first question asked almost every time is of genuine concern over Robin's health condition. The company and Robin certainly appreciate this concern and support. I assure you that none of his medical issues are in any way life threatening. Robin has struggled with anxiety and other similar issues for years. With the increasing demands and stress of being CEO of a large and growing public company, he feels he would now rather invest his future time and attention on his health and his personal and family's real estate business. Real estate has always been a passion for Robin, and we wish him the best of luck in the future. From a personal standpoint, I enjoyed working side-by-side with Robin for all these years and our interactions with the investment community. For those of you who know Robin, his family is very close to him, and he is especially proud of the accomplishments and well-being of his 3 children. His resignation will allow him to spend his time on what is most important to him. As many of you know, Aaron's has an experienced and long-tenured management team in place throughout the organization, and we have worked together successfully for years. We certainly see Ron as a viable leader who will work with our team as the company moves forward. As for the next steps in this process, as noted in the press release, a committee of the board will begin to conduct a search for Aaron's next permanent CEO. I would now like to introduce Ron Allen as Aaron's new Interim CEO. Ron was with Delta Air Lines for 34 years and served as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from 1987 to 1997. Ron has been a very active and engaged member of Aaron's Board of Directors for 14 years and has served on the company's Audit Committee over this time. He brings a wealth of business experience to the CEO position. Ron, I'd like to turn the call over to you for a few comments. Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Gil, thank you very much. I have enjoyed being a part of this team as a board member since 1997 and a long-term friend of Charlie Loudermilk's. And I'd like to say I'm really honored to be in this role as an Interim Chief Executive Officer and President. I know the top leadership quite well, and I'm just excited about the future of this company. And to be a part of that now as its CEO is even more gratifying. So I look forward to the weeks and days ahead. This is a very unique company. To have the founder of this company still operating as Chairman of the Board and active is very unique. And going forward, we want to build upon that legacy. We want to strengthen those basic foundations that have made this company so unique in this industry and build on those going forward. So I look forward to being a part of that effort. And now, let me turn it over to a fellow Southwest DeKalb High School. You didn't realize I'd say that, did you? William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes, I appreciate it. Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Ken Butler and I graduated from the same fine high school here in South DeKalb county in -- near Atlanta, Georgia. And Ken, I'll turn it over to you. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes. At least you said we graduated, so that's [indiscernible]. Well we're certainly sorry to see Robin go, and we only wish him well. But we're now extremely excited about Ron coming onboard and the experience and all the things that we feel like he can bring to the table. We have a very, very strong management team, over 20 Vice Presidents with over 20 years experience in the industry a piece. So we're particularly excited about filling out the United States of America with the Aaron's model. We're excited about our expansion into Canada, the development of our HomeSmart model and RIMCO model as well as the new European investment we made just a month ago. So the future is bright in Aaron's. I think it's going to be -- even be better with someone of Ron's caliber coming in and just looking at what we're doing and kind of do a litmus test and hopefully, bringing something to the party that can only make us better in the future. So thank you, Ron. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, that's our comments. We'll certainly answer any questions that anybody -- anyone may have."
93,GV_001076_2008Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Aaron Rent first quarter earning call. At this time all participants on a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gil Danielson. Mr. Danielson, you may begin. Gil Danielson Thank you for joining us this morning. I am going to turn the call over briefly to Lee Wilder, who does investor relation work for the Company and she will read our standard Safe Harbor Statement and she will turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie will have a few comments and then Ken and then me. Lee Wilder Good morning, the Company's earnings release issued yesterday and the related from 8K are available on the Aaron Bruce website in the Investor Relations Section. This webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, CEO, Robert Loudermilk, President, Ken Butler, President of Aaron Sales & Lease Ownership and Gil Danielson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the Company's Safe Harbor Statement. Except for the historical information and that is discussed today our forward looking statement of the Company, as such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demands and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under risk factors in the Company's 2007 annual report on form 10K. Including without limitation the Company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings for future periods. I will now turn the call over to Charlie Loudermilk. Charlie Loudermilk Thank you again for the interest in the Company. I am quite pleased that the first quarter 2008 exceeded our earnings expectation. It seems like the Company is back on track. Our write offs, we have been working very hard on that and it is now down to 2 to 2.5%. The big number that I see in this is that we have a nine cent new store drag last quarter and of course when you reopen 250 stores in about 18 months, we expected a large new store drag. That drag should be less and less each month thereafter because these stores are getting older. As we all know, the first month when a store opens our largest loss. It decreases as time goes on. The Company is doing very well; I am very pleased that our people have responded to our call for this being the year of the profit; last year was the year of the store openings and this year is the year of the profit. They are responding well and from the Chairman, I can tell you I am pleased. Ken. Ken Butler Yes, thank you Charlie. Once again, I want to thank all of our fellow associates, franchisee and vendor partners for their effort not only this last quarter but for the last 18 months. Our people have risen to every challenge that we presented for them and I am very grateful for their efforts. These past 18 months, we have been going full throttle opening new stores. This past quarter, we saw the beginning of the slow down as we opened 27 new stores. We also worked with franchisees by acquiring 13 new franchise stores and we sold 11 back to franchisee. We are looking at areas of the country; we have strong management in looking at areas that we may be weaker and seeing might be better suited to franchise. We are also looking at every store’s performance and we have closed 25 under performing stores during the quarter. We fully absorbed the losses in the quarter associated with these store closings. The conclusion of this is that we are pulling any leads we may have in the system and will continue to focus on improving profitability. We will continue to do this the next two quarters and allow our management team to strengthen our bench and look to eliminate much of the new store drag we are currently experiencing. We look to begin a normalized expansion plan at 10 to 12% new store growth in 2009. We are already seeing our bench replenished in our new internet based training we call e-university is showing positive results. This quarter, we gained a record first quarter 36,000 new customers, which is slightly ahead of our then record customer growth in the first quarter of ’07. In the first week of April, we attained a new milestone by adding our one millionth active customer on lease. Our business in April is ahead of last year and we are optimistic for our growth this quarter with the tax rebates beginning in May. On the write off side of things, I am real pleased with the quick turn around our team has accomplished by going back to a paper system versus a paperless system and we have immediately posted better operating results in our collection and write off areas. Our franchise systems continue to move forward as we awarded 15 new stores fronts to the quarter bringing our pipeline at the 300 new franchise stores to open in the future. Overall, we remain upbeat and we look forward to the future of our customer will be receiving a tax rebate this quarter and a mandated digital signal, which in February 2009 will continue to increase our high definition sales of televisions. Now, for Gil. Gil Danielson. Why don’t we have Robin report on (inaudible) to rent. Robin Loudermilk Not a lot happening there just busy. As Ken reported, a lot of sales in our furniture actually seem to be strong. The furniture sales in our stores counter to a lot of folks we hear out there on the streets, we are very pleased with that. We are doing a lot of advertising and moving a lot of products through our furniture manufacturing. We are happy; we are ahead of last year as far as production and profitability in those plants. We run a break even but the process is kind of relative, but we are ahead or we were. We shouldn’t see a drag there. Rent to rent is flat; it has been flat. It has been that way for years. We have a lot of good associates in there that are working on it. We are opening a couple of new stores where the markets and the customers want our services. All in all, it is kind of flattish, but again manufacture is positive and rent to rent still continues to be profitable. It has always been a very profitable piece of our business and we assure that will continue, Gill. Gil Danielson Thanks Robin, I will go through some of the highlights for the quarter. The Company revenues increased 13% to 437.3 million. The sales and lease ownership revenues increased 16% during the quarter, compared to a year ago to 406.3 million. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues to 167.4 million, a 13% increase over last year’s quarter. The revenues of the franchisees are not, however revenues of Aaron Rent, Inc. The same store revenue growth for the quarter for the Company stores was 2.6% and for the franchise stores, it was 13%. Net earnings for the quarter were 24.8 million or $0.46 per share compared to $0.48 last year when we absoluted the parking debt fill we had in the first quarter of 2007. As the press release said, we did do a lot of movement in the stores during the quarter. We added a net three new Aaron Stores with a lot of merging and realignment during the quarter. We opened 14 new Company operated stores, 8 new franchise stores, 2 Company operated Renco Stores and 2 franchise Renco Stores. Also merged and closed, 20 Company operated and pre-franchise stores during the quarter. In addition, we did acquire 13 franchise stores and sold 11 Company stores to franchisees. We opened two new corporate furnishing stores and then closed two stores. A lot of that realignment that was certainly done so far this year and there will be some more continuing throughout the year. All being made to just look at the business and the ultimate goal is to increase the profitability of the Company. We did record a $2.3 million gain in the quarter from the sale of the Company operated stores to the franchisees; however we did have some lease obligations. Primarily lease obligations which we had to record and a few other cost of real estate of 1.6 million associated with those closings and merging. As Ken mentioned, we awarded area development agreement to open another 50 franchise stores during the quarter and our pipeline of stores to open at the end of March with 300 stores. At March 30, we had 983 Company operated sales and lease ownership stores open, 483 franchise stores, 29 Company operated Renco stores, 6 franchise Renco stores and 62 corporate furniture stores open for a total 1,563 stores. As we mentioned in the press release, we did re-purchase some more shares of Aaron Rent common stock during the first quarter and we currently have approximately 3.9 million shares authorized for additional repurchase at this time. We talked a little about the same store revenue growth. If we take out the Florida market, the Florida market continues to be soft for the Company; the same store revenue growth for the quarter would have been 3.4%. The write offs, we will mention that a little bit have certainly started to improve that is percentage of revenues. If you look at sales and lease ownership store level gross revenues, the write offs were 2.5% in the first quarter compared to 3.1% in the fourth quarter and they were higher than that in the third quarter. Certainly the trends are getting much better from the Company side and the write offs and we expected to see some incremental improvement as we go out throughout this year, 2008. That’s our comments for the quarter, we will certainly take any questions and answers that people may have."
94,GV_001076_2009Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Aaron's First Quarter Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gil Danielson. Mr. Danielson, you may begin. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you for joining us today. As usual, I’m going to turn the call over to Lee Wilder, who does Investor Relations for us and she'll read our Safe Harbor statement. And then we'll have a few comments, but I won't take too long on the comments and then we'll open it up for questions and answers, so Lee? Lee Wilder Good morning, my name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in the Investor Relations for Aaron. The company's earnings release issued yesterday and the related Form 8-K are available on our website, in the Investor Relations section. This webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the result, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for this historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under risk factors in the company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K, including without limitations, the company's projected revenues, earnings, store openings and store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Ken and Charlie will have a few opening comments and then Gil will add further information. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Thank you, Lee. Obviously, we are very pleased with the first quarter results. The record revenues and earnings exceeded our expectations. As known in our earnings release, our business have been strong in this credit tightening environment. However, we have done well through the years in all types of economic climate for the past 50 years. We do believe that the current conditions and the trading down of our good customers has voluntarily or involuntarily have been beneficial to our business as we continue to see more customers come to our stores to obtain the basic home furnishings. In addition, we are seeing a strong interest in our program both from new potential franchisees and existing weekly return operators looking to convert to our monthly lease program. Providing home basic furnishings with no credit checks and the ability to return the merchandising at any time is the major strength of our program. In addition to the market share gains, we believe the market is expanding on the upper end, and hopefully this is a permanent expansion as the Aaron's model becomes more acceptable and attractive to a broader, financially stable consumer. In this light, you've noted we had changed our corporate name to Aaron's Inc. and our symbol to AAN to align it with our trade name on the street and to reflect our unique business model. Our plans for the next two years is to grow on average our store base in the range of 5% to 9% with conversions and acquisitions, et cetera. This growth rate will let us grow over time in a consistent, predictable and efficient manner and this should improve future profit margins and overall financial performance. We have become more proactive on a rate of over 45 [ph] and hope for a positive outcome in Washington regarding our leased transaction. I want to thank you all up for the support of our company. And I'll now turn it over to Ken for comments from his division. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Thank you, Robin. A well-known CEO from a major retail chain once said, ""It's all about the stores, dummy!"" To sum up our performance for the last decade, our people will say, ""It's all about the customer, dummy!"" Our customer account continues to grow rapidly as we gained 51,887 customers during the quarter, and that is the primary matrix we look forward to determine the overall health of our business. Obviously, our collections, write-offs and expenses are carefully monitored as well. But our ability to track and maintain customers is a defining category to measure our current success but also our future quarters as we build up an ongoing annuity with each customer that will last for 12, 18 or 24 months. The larger customer base you build will result in higher revenues per store, better store comps and lower fixed costs on a per store basis. Our same-store comps for the quarter were a staggering 12.3%, and all of our markets now are showing positive same-store comps including Florop [ph] and some other areas of the country that are previously seem to be slumping somewhat due to the housing market. We feel due to the current economic environment even though there's been a strain on our core customer base, that it has expanded our current customer base as many of our new customers simply do not have the credit availability to purchase household goods in the retail sector. Our program would guarantee lowest prices and the largest selection in our industry certainly has been attracting a new customer. Our focus on the acquisition and maintenance of our existing customer base and new customers has continued to take huge dividend. Another initiative that we started a couple of years ago that is paying off today is the conversion program for good competitive operators from our industry who want to switch their stores to the Aaron's business model. I've heard a couple of them state, ""If you can't beat them, you might as well join them!"" Thus far, we have converted nine hand-fixed strong competitors, and that's resulted in 55 additional store fronts in our franchise community. These deals are a win-win scenario if our new franchisee gets to reap the benefit of our strong branding and marketing arm, our purchasing power and nationwide distribution system. Aaron's get the new store fronts with proven operators. Our first two conversions that we did in the fourth quarter of 2006 actually tied for our 2008 franchisees of the year. Having this quality operators will not only strengthen our program but it will also give you some light on just how strong our program is. We continue to see new construction and real estate costs coming down for new stores and remodels. That's from an expense standpoint which we keep a firm grip on our expenses in this period and years to come. On another note, we are on the edge of launching on Aaron's is going green campaign, which had helped to reduce our overall operating expenses and help the environment we all live within. Our special thanks goes out to all our associates, to franchisees and partners who are working hard everyday to continue to produce great results for our shareholders. Now I'd like to pass the call over to Charlie for a few comments. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, just a few comments. I couldn't be more pleased with our management team and over 10,000 associates. It's not easy to grow a company outside of over 12% in three months. And I also want to compliment our franchisees, they are doing a great job. We're very happy with them. And I get comments constantly from franchisees in how well they're doing and how they love the company. So with that, thank you, all the franchisees as well as the 10,000 employees. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President I'll just go through a few of the comments on the financial highlights. As you know, the company's revenues increased 15% for the quarter to 474 million. Our franchisees increased their revenues, although not our revenues, they increased their revenues 16% to 193.6 million. As mentioned, our same-store revenue growth in the first quarter for the Aaron's stores was 12.3%, and for the stores that were over two years old, it was 7.9%. The same-store revenue growth for the franchised stores was up 15%. We had 750,000 corporate customers and 395,000 franchise customers at the end of the first quarter, a 20% increase in total customers over the first quarter of '08. And the customer count on a same-store basis for the company stores was up 17%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were 35.4 million or 55 per diluted share compared $0.42 per diluted share last year, an increase of 55%. In the other revenues in the first quarter of '09, we did have $5.7 million of gain from when we sold some asset step of from stores of asset. A lot of that came about we did from conversions during the quarter, the Kelly Rentals transaction was a conversion. And we only increased our total net store count by 20 stores in the quarter, but a lot of movement in between. And these conversions, we will continue those. Don't really speculate what kind of prices will be in the future, but we will continue doing some of those. The new store drag for the quarter was approximately $0.04 per diluted share compared to $0.09 in the first quarter of last year. Area development agreement awarded in the quarter to open another 71 franchised stores and the franchised stores is expected to open in the future at the end of March was 300 stores. At March 31, we have 1011 company-operated Aaron stores, 532 franchised stores, we had 11 company RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and 15 office furniture stores, for a total of 1577 stores. As we noted in the earnings release, our guidance for the second quarter, debt, revenues, an excess of 430 million, and earnings per share in the range of 45 to $0.50 per share. And we are raising our revenue guidance to 1.8 billion company revenues for the guidance for '09. And we also raised our guidance for earnings per share for the year based on our resells in this first quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year to $1.90 to $2.05 per share. We noted we continue to anticipate new store growth of approximately 5% to 9%, and kind of been looking at an equal mix between company operated and franchised stores. We also plan to continue to acquire franchised stores, conversion dependent operators or sale from time to time company stores is warranted to franchisees and perhaps others. Our manufacturing shipments from our plants were strong also during the first quarter, they are up 9% for the quarter. The write-off as a percentage at store level of growth revenues for the quarter were 2.2% for the first quarter of this year. A year ago, it was 2.5%, so they're certainly have been trending in the right direction in that regard. Tax rate for the quarter are 38.2%. I would expect the tax rate for the '09 to be in that area, between 38 and 38.5%. Let me about the -- company stores, about 26% of our company stores were less than two years old at the end of March. And at the end of March, 45% of our company-operated stores and 34% of our franchised stores were over five years old. That means majority were less than five years old. Our bank debt decreased 35 million during the first quarter from quarter at the end of December, which is roughly how much cash we generated from operations during the quarter. One thing I did look, and this is a comment, we talked about Michigan last time in previous quarters. We looked at the same-store revenues in our company stores in Michigan, Michigan were up 8%. And the unemployment rate last time we checked was 12%. So that's certainly a vindication that we're doing well in difficult economic environments. And those Michigan stores on average are 7.5 years old, so it's not like there's a group of new stores there. I did mention the -- I might have made a mistake on this, I did mention the corporate customers, 760,000 corporate customers. And we almost had have a million to customers in fold. We'll certainly take any questions that inside will have at this time."
95,GV_001076_2010Q1,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Aaron's, Inc. First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gilbert Danielson. Thank you, and have a good conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay, well, thank you all for joining us today. As is our normal routine, Lee Wilder will read our standard Safe Harbor statement. And then Robin and Charlie and Ken will then have a few opening comments, and then I'll follow up with some comments on the financial information. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,in the Investor Relations section. And this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today is Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic condition, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings, store openings and acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Charlie and Ken will have a few opening comments, and then Gil will add further information on the financial results. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director All right. Thank you, Lee. I do appreciate that. Thank you, everybody, for joining the conference call. As you've probably seen, this current release, our first quarter results were very good, and we were pleased that they're at the high end of our earnings guidance that we have stated. We're pleased that our company-operated stores, having same-store revenue growth of 4.4% and customer growth of 7.4%. In addition, although not the revenues of Aaron's, Inc., our franchised stores experienced a 5.2% growth in same-store revenues during this quarter. The total of our corporate franchise customers were up 12% over the same period last year. And we see customer gains, as we've said before, the key metric in our business, and as long as these gains continue, our business should prosper. As noted in our earnings release, Aaron's has a very predictable and has annuity-type business that has performed well over a number of years through different economic cycles. Our business model is unique. Our customer base remains large and growing. The demand for our Proxy TV is strong, and we feel a potential for continued growth in both existing and new stores. It is still there, we believe, for many, many more years to come. As credit tightened, as you've all seen, we've done well, and I think that current economic condition will continue to be good for our business. We continue to do well, even better in some of our highest unemployment markets that we continue to survey. The Aaron's Office Furniture division, basically 10 stores left in that division continues to struggle, and we have a plan in place and are working very hard making changes, closing a few stores, consolidate, selling some inventory, for both revenue growth and overall financial performance will improve. The Office Furniture market, as I'm sure many of you are aware, is very difficult at this time in this economic climate. And so that alone will make it hard to show improvement until those business conditions improve. However, we are definitely not satisfied with the performance of these stores and expect improvement in financial performance as we continue through this year. We have a lot of folks and associates that are working daily for consolidating stores, moving inventory around and selling inventories to achieve this goal over the next six to 12 months. Our plans for 2010 are unchanged as we're looking to increase our store count by the approximate 5% to 9% of stated goal we've had, the number of stores opened in 2009. We anticipate that 2010, which happens to be our 55th year in existence, will be another excellent year. Thank you for your support of the company, and I will now turn to Charlie for a few comments, and then Ken will talk about some operating results. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, thank you for your interest in our company. I just want to say that, well, I'm very pleased with our team, how they're working, how everything is working together. And I want to thank all the 10,000 employees that we have for the job they are doing. Running our stores is not easy, but our people are up to the challenge, so they're doing a great job. And I'm very happy with -- as a Chairman, very happy with how we're doing it. Ken? William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes, well, good evening, and thank you for joining us this evening. We are once again very pleased with our operating results as our program continues to dominate the markets in which we operate. Our numbers with our same-store sales, up 4.4% and same-store customer count, up 7.4%, or even more impressive when you consider the phenomenal first quarter of 2009 added with the serious weather- related challenges we had in the first quarter just to compound the obstacles we had to overcome. As always, our people met that challenge. Overall, our customer count is up 12% over last year's customer base. We expect to continue our new store expansion with approximately 90 new company-operated stores and 75 new franchised stores for 2010. We'll continue to weed out, close or merge approximately 25 to 30 underperfoming stores in 2010. Our RIMCO model was profitable for the quarter and in fact, operated in the black all three consecutive months. We'll continue to tweak this model to maximize revenue and profit so you could see a proper way to expand itself in the future. One thing that I am most proud about is an initiative we began about a year ago to take Aaron's green. Not only will we do what's right for the environment, but it will help reduce operating costs as well. Our factories were the first to jump on board and, literally, have eliminated millions of tons of waste from going to landfills. It all started by maximizing material waste and yield and expanded with recycling paper, cardboard, soda plastics and aluminum. Our stores, DCs and home office support will be following this project as well. Our real estate and construction department, going green by changing our lighting systems we've placed in the stores to conserve energy, as well as changing the paint, tile and carpet to biodegradable products. They're also being much more efficient material products to stop all the waste. Our DC has greatly reduced fuel economy and efficiency by contracting outside companies for the back hauls to the DC after they've made their deliveries to our stores. Our stores are looking in at what they can do to eliminate more paperwork in their operations, and they have already initiated some programs that conservatively will save 125 trees a month. We realized, the bigger we get, the more responsible we have to become. And I continue to be amazed by the effort of all our associates, vendors, franchisees, of meeting whatever challenge we present to them. I want to personally thank them on behalf of the company for their continued dedication and loyalty to our company and our culture. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Ken. I'll go through some of the highlights of the first quarter. Company revenues increased 4% for the quarter to $495.3 million. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues to $220.2 million for the first quarter, a 14% increase over the period of last year. Revenues of franchisees are not, however, revenues of Aaron's, Inc. Included in last year's first quarter other revenues were the $5.7 million gain on the sales of company- operated stores. This quarter, there were no similar-store sales. If you excluded that gain from last year's number compared to these, it would be a non-GAAP number. But if you did that, our revenues would've been up 6% and net earnings from continuing operations, up 15% in the first quarter of '10 compared to the first quarter of 2009. As you all know, we had announced the 3-for-2 stock split on April 1, and went effective actually at the end of the day on April 15. And the first quarter earnings per share and the weighted average shares have been restated to reflect the stock split. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter for the Aaron's company-operated stores was 4.4%, and it was 2.9% for stores over two years old. For the stores over five years old for the quarter, it was 1.2%. Same-store revenue growth for our franchised stores was, as previously mentioned, 5.2%. At the end of the first quarter, we had 840,000 company-operated store customers and 453,000 franchised customers. Now that's a 12% in total customers over the same comparable number at the end of the first quarter of 2009. And as Ken said, the customer count on a same-store basis for the quarter was up 7.4%. The first quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and actually total diluted earnings per share were $0.45 compared to $0.43 last year. As the press release, we noted the Aaron's Office Furniture stores revenues decreased 27% for the quarter. And we did lose money in 2010. That's been the case for a number of quarter. But as Robin addressed it, we do have some plans in place to improve the financial performance of the stores in the upcoming quarters. During the first quarter of 2010, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 12 new company stores and nine new franchise stores. We also acquired three franchised stores and one store from a non- affiliated operator and acquired the accounts of four third-party stores. Seven company stores and one franchised store were closed during the quarter. And also, three Aaron's Office Furniture stores were closed. The new store drag for the quarter, and this is after the stock split, was approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter. And it was a similar number against split adjusted of $0.03 in the first quarter of last year. During the three months ended March 31, the company awarded area development agreements to open 14 additional franchised stores. And at the end of March of 2010, there were 268 franchised stores awarded that are expected to be open over the next several years. The store count at March 31, we had 1,080 company stores, 595 franchised stores, 11 company-operated RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and 12 Office Furniture stores, for a total of 1,705 stores. Our guidance for the second quarter of 2010 is to expect revenues of approximately $445 million, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.37 to $0.41 per share. Our revenue guidance remains the same as it was last quarter out of full year of approximately $1.85 billion. We have increased our diluted earnings per share expectations for 2010. And on it again, after the split adjusted, we expect to earn this year in 2010 EPS in the range of $1.48 to $1.60. Again, our new store growth plans remain the same. Robin talked about that. And we anticipate a mix growth in new stores this year than that incurred in '09. At the end of the quarter, we had $112 million of cash on hand. Number is very big, but you're seeing not much cash on hand. We did use approximately $26 million in cash flow from operations in the first quarter. We had a lot of purchases that we made as business picked up pretty dramatically at the end of the fourth quarter. And we sold $27 million of asset sales and leasebacks of stores that we haven't been doing over the last several years. The manufacturing shipments from our [indiscernible], the manufacturing furniture, manufacturing plants were up 6% in the first quarter. And we continue to have positive same-store revenues in some of the highest unemployment periods in the country, quite pleased that the earnings model is working in these economic times. We'll certainly have to take any questions anybody may have at this time."
96,GV_001076_2011Q1,"Presentation Operator [Operator Instructions] Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director And then Robin, Ken, Charlie and myself will have a few more comments. Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments, and then Gil will add some further information. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Thank you, Lee. I appreciate that. Needless to say, we're quite excited about our first quarter 2011 results, which were a record for the company in both revenues and earnings, and substantially better than our expectations. As we discussed last quarter, and have been saying for some time now, we believe that the current economic environment will continue to be favorable for our business model. However, as many of you may recall, we did very well in previous years when credit was very loose and employment tough -- excuse me, employment quite good. Aaron's business model is not recession proof, but it's proven to be recession resilient. Aaron's has done well for several years now in some of the highest unemployment areas in the country. Our near-term hope is that the economy improves, and as a result, unemployment rates decline giving Aaron's customer's much-needed cash to satisfy the many daily demands. Earnings were up this quarter due to our revenue growth, and effect -- excuse me, I'm sorry. Earnings records for -- due to our revenue growth and effect on giving management of our operating expenses. I'm sorry there. We're consistently looking for ways to increase revenues and earnings. And as noted, on our last earnings call, we have continued to have several new initiatives in different stages at corporate level to structure functions, reduce cost, increase productivity and improve overall efficiencies. There is no 1 initiative that will spike earnings overnight, but it's a continuing process that should continue to improve margins over the upcoming periods. Our wood furniture manufacturing plants saw a 14% increase in production in dollars for the quarter, a record quarter, I might add, a reflection of the increased demand by Aaron's systemwide corporate and franchised stores for our furniture products. Woodhaven, our Furniture Manufacturing division, has focused its efforts on continuing to offer an ever- expanding line of products, prices that are competitive with the open market place. Economic conditions have continued to put downward pressure on prices. Woodhaven has maintained a level of quality and consistently focus extra effort in providing good customer service, while aggressively pricing the product offerings. We are monitoring closely the steady increase in raw materials and freight costs due to the recent increase in oil prices. Woodhaven bedding shipments were up substantially in the first quarter over the same period last year, the addition of bedding facilities in Kansas City and Phoenix plus higher volumes at existing service areas, increased the number of units moved in 2011 by 94%. For the second straight year, Woodhaven was able to reduce price on some of our existing product offerings. The reduction of price per unit was offset by continuation of our cost reduction efforts at the plant's increased volume in existing facilities of approximately 45% and strong performance at our new facility. I will now turn it over to Ken Butler for some comments, including national media campaign and our experimental HomeSmart weekly pay store concepts. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Thank you, Robin. I echo your remarks on Woodhaven because they just won the award here in Atlanta for their going green initiative and they've done an unbelievable job in recycling materials in their plant. Really, it's cut waste and dollars, has helped hold our prices down. Once again, our numbers for the quarter were outstanding, but we did have a much challenged start with the ice and snow storms that affected a large percentage of our stores in the month of January. I want to thank all of our associates from literally digging their way out of the snow and ice to continue to serve our customers each and every day. Our traffic in our stores is at an all-time high, as our national TV campaign kicked off at the beginning of February. Our stores continue to gain market share each and every day we operate. Additionally, we continue to see opportunities with the growing number of credit challenged customers. Our new tagline is credit is hard and Aaron's is easy, speaks to this customer and you'll see more of that statement in the future. We've been focusing on our average agreements per customer in hopes of increasing our average income per customer as the trend line has been down due to price degradation over the last few years. I'm happy to report that our average agreement per customer has steadily risen from 1.38 per customer in September of '09 to 1.45 agreements in March of this year. This has resulted in an upward tick in our average income per customer from $133.65 in December 2010, now to $134.14 per customer in March of 2011. This is the first quarter where we've seen an uptick since we started reporting this metric in late 2008. Our HomeSmart concept is catching wind, as we add 5 stores open, we opened 1 during the quarter. All are performing very well by our standards, we should open up 12 new stores in the second quarter and another 5 in the third quarter. Customer acceptance to the program has been strong. And we see little or no cannibalization from the closest Aaron's locations. Our associates and franchisees combined our rallying, as we focus on obtaining $2 billion in our company stores and $1 billion in our franchise stores for 2011. Combining these revenues will make our brand the largest operator in the U.S.A. and the world. So Charlie, I'm going to turn it over to you after making that statement. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus It was a really good statement. I couldn't be more pleased with the company's results. I'm quite proud of our management team and all our associates and franchisees that helped achieve these outstanding quarterly results. I look forward to what we believe will be continuing good results for the remainder of the year. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Charlie. I'll go through some of the details for everybody, kind of highlight for the first quarter. Our company revenues increased 8% for the quarter to $532.7 million. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues 10% to $241.3 million. Of course, revenues of our franchisees are not revenues of Aaron's Inc. Same store revenue in the first quarter was very strong, kind of at the high end of our expectation at 6%. And it was 3.9% increase for stores over 2 years old. For stores over 5 years old, which is a strong reflection of the health of our business, the same-store revenue growth was 2% positive. Same-store revenue growth for the franchise stores was 3.9%. The company had 914,000 company- operated store customers and 499,000 franchise customers at the end of the quarter. That was a 9% increase in total customers over the number at the end of first quarter of 2010. On a same-store basis, the customer count per company stores was up 6.3% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. Same-store revenues and customer accounts for franchise stores were up 3.9% and 5.4%, respectively. That was the first quarter compared to last year, again the revenues in customers of franchisees are not Aaron's Inc.'s revenues. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were up 20% to $44.4 million and the diluted earnings per share was up to $0.55 compared to $0.45 last year. That was an increase of 22%. Looking at the income statement, the dollar amount of our lower margin non-retail sales was up 5%. We're pleased with that for the quarter. For the first quarter of 2011, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 10 new company- operated stores, 9 new franchise stores, 1 RIMCO store and 2 HomeSmart stores. We also acquired 1 franchise store and another store from an unaffiliated operator and acquired the accounts of 2 third- party stores. We did sell 3 of our company-operated stores to Aaron's franchisees and closed 5 company stores and opened 3 franchise stores. There's a lot of movement in there as been the case for a number of quarters. We constantly, always with the thought that will be the most profitable for us and for our franchisees, of trading stores around if it makes economic sense. For the 3 months ended March 31 of this year, the company has awarded area of development agreements to open 6 additional franchise stores. Our backlog of stores, of franchise stores to open over the next few years, was at 271 at the end of March. At the end of March, we had 1,140 company Sales & Lease stores, 666 franchise stores, 11 company-operated RIMCO stores 6 franchised RIMCO stores. We have the 5 HomeSmart stores we mentioned. And we did have the 1 remaining Aaron's Office Furniture store that's open now, just liquidating the merchandise of the Office Furniture division. At the end of March 31, we had 1,829 stores. As we mentioned at the end of March, had cash on hand of $196 million. We really had no debt to speak of it also. We did during the quarter acquire 357,019 shares of our common stock during the quarter and we have just a little bit more than 4 million shares authorized for repurchase. Our guidance for the second quarter of 2011 is to expect revenues of approximately $480 million, and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.38 to $0.42 per share, not really changing our revenue guidance for 2011. And we still will reach approximately, probably in fees [ph] a little bit of $2 billion in company revenues. Our franchisee revenues will -- I'm not sure what they'll come in at, but the combined company stores and the franchise revenues for 2011, our goal is to reach the $3 billion mark. So that's the target, we'll see how that works out. As far as earnings are concerned, in 2011, we did increase our earnings guidance it's a range of $1.69 to $1.81. We're not changing our new store growth plan as we started out the year expecting new store growth of 5% to 9%. That is still in our plan. Got some questions, that 5% to 9%, will also -- inside that, will include our 21 HomeSmart stores we talked about. We also plan to continue to acquire franchise stores, convert independent operators as opportunities present themselves and also sell company stores to franchisees and perhaps others. We did generate during the quarter, a little over $140 million in cash flow from operations, about $100 million of that came from getting a refund from the IRS of the tax refund. We talked about that last quarter and also the less tax payments we're making in 2011. Again in 2011, we expect to add approximately 90 new company- operated stores and 75 franchise stores at this time. Those are the prepared comments, we'll certainly open it up to any questions that anybody may have."
97,GV_001076_2012Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Aaron's Inc. Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gil Danielson with Aaron's Inc. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As usual, I'm going to turn it over to Lee Wilder, who'll read our standard Safe Harbor statement and then we'll start the call. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good morning. My name is Lee Wilder and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued last night and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Ron Allen, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors, such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, litigation, customer pricing, information security, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings and store acquisitions, as well as disposition activity for future periods. Ron, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments, and then Gil will add further information. Ron? Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you, Lee, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and we thank you for joining us today. I'm honored to participate in my second earnings call since becoming CEO. It's a pleasure to discuss the first quarter results of our operations. As detailed in our earnings release last evening, we had another outstanding quarter, with records in both revenues and earnings, and overall results were better than expectations. We've raised our revenue and earnings guidance for the year and feel we have very good momentum as we move forward through the rest of 2012. Business has continued to be strong due to high customer traffic and demand and our ability to execute and meet that demand, even though our customers have been affected for years now by high unemployment and generally difficult economic conditions. As we've noted in the past, we feel the tight consumer credit market has actually helped Aaron's business as customers, who in the past would have qualified for credit at retail establishments are being constantly turned down for financing. People need good basic home furnishings and they can obtain these goods at Aaron's with our very good product offerings, our service, our flexible payment plans and the fact there are no credit checks. We anticipate that the current market conditions will continue to exist in the foreseeable future, and if the past is any indication, we should have a continuing good environment for our business. Now during my first 6 months as CEO, I have observed and worked with an outstanding team of associates. Aaron's has a long-tenured management team throughout the organization who know our customers and the marketplace, and our business model is superior to others. Our management team has been spending more time recently on business planning and the rethinking of some of our support functions and exploring ways to do various tasks a little better which, over the long term, will result in improved efficiencies and increase profitability for the company. One thing we are concentrating on in 2012 is improving our management recruiting, our training and retention. Our goal is to make Aaron's one of the premier workplaces in America and to continue to attract outstanding managers and associates. Now most of you are probably aware that we did settle the sexual harassment lawsuit in the first quarter and brought back in income some of the amount that had been accrued for in the second quarter of 2011 for this litigation expense. And believe me, it's good to have this distraction behind us. Today, the future looks bright for the company. There is plenty of expansion, left both in existing stores and in new ones and we are encouraged by the early returns of our HomeSmart stores. There's always room for improvement, but the company's strategy and growth plans are not changing. There's certainly no reason to do so. Charlie Loudermilk founded this company a remarkable 57 years ago, which has proven year in and year out to be exceptional in every way. And I plan to continue to learn from Charlie and build on the legacy he has established and given our customers, our associates, our business partners and our shareholders. We, again, thank you for your support and interest in the company. Now I'll turn the call over to Ken Butler who will talk more about the results for the quarter. And at the conclusion of Gil's comments, we will answer any questions that you may have. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Thank you, Ron. And first of all, I want to thank all of our associates and franchisees for your continued hard work and dedication in helping us to consistently perform at a very high level of service to our customers and shareholders. This service resulted in a gain of 40,000 new customers into the Aaron's and HomeSmart family, which represents a 14% increase in customer count over the same quarter a year ago. We will continue to focus more just on the basic execution of running our business model as our traffic in our stores is brisk, and I know everyone on our team feels we have an opportunity to even do better in the future. We had 74 HomeSmart stores open at the end of the quarter and pleased with this progress so far. We improved the bottom line of each stores from a loss of $0.03 in the fourth quarter to a loss of $0.01 in the first quarter. We will pause the aggressive expansion of the model temporarily as we evaluate and tweak the model. We feel the long-term potential for HomeSmart is huge and can help propel future growth for the entire company. Again, no big initiatives to announce other than the commitment from all of us to focus on our core business and to continue to deliver great results in the future. And this time, I'd like to turn the call over to our founder, Charlie Loudermilk. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Thank you, Ken. And I want to second everything you all have said. We are doing well, we have an outstanding team in place to run the company. I don't know that we've ever had more future than we have right now. As it has been, I want to again thank everyone whose given a lot for the last few months. And given a good quarter that we just announced. I see that we can have a great quarter right now, the one we have now, the second quarter. I want to say that Ron Allen is learning the business very quickly and I think that looks very positive for the company. But here again, thank you to the franchises and also to everyone. Thank you. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay. Well, thank you, Charlie. I'll briefly go through some of the highlights of the first quarter. The company revenues increased 10% for the quarter to $586.9 million. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues 10% for the quarter up to $254.4 million. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter for our company-operated stores was 4.8%, and it was 2.6% for stores over 2 years old. The stores -- company stores in the system over 5 years old, the same-store revenue increase was 1.3% over the previous year. The company had just a little bit more than 1 million company-operated store customers and 554,000 franchised customers at the end of the quarter. As Ken mentioned, there's a 14% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the first quarter last year. The customer count on a same- store basis per company-operated stores was up 8.6% in the first quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Same-store revenues for franchised stores were up 6.3% through the quarter, and same-  store customer counts for the franchised stores were up 8.3%. Revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues from customers of Aaron's Inc. Net earnings for the quarter, up 50% to $71.2 million, and our EPS, our diluted earnings per share for the quarter, was $0.92 compared to $0.55 for the same period last year. As noted in the earnings release, during the first quarter, we did take into income $35.5 million or $0.28 per diluted share in accrual reversal of the lawsuit charges that we set up in the second quarter of 2011. Excluding this lawsuit-related reversal of accrual in the first quarter, our net earnings would have been $49.2 million, up 11% over the same period of last year. And as the earnings release said, diluted earnings per share would have been $0.64, a 15% (sic) [16%] increase over last year. HomeSmart continues to ramp up as expected. Revenues of HomeSmart division for the quarter were $12.5 million versus $330 million in revenues last year. And then as Ken mentioned, our new store operating drag for the HomeSmart stores this quarter was approximately $0.01 per share, and that compared to the $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter last year and 7% for the whole year last year. So as we've stated, we are going to open a few HomeSmart stores this year. We've opened a couple in the quarter. There's a few more that we'll open in the rest of the year, but we will not have the rapid ramp up of HomeSmart that we had last year. And even though we've lost a little bit in the first quarter, we're hopeful that, for the whole year, that we will be very, very close to profitability. We'll be quite a bit of a swing from the previous year. During the first quarter of 2012, the company opened 9 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 6 franchised stores and 2 HomeSmart stores. We also acquired 3 franchised stores and the accounts of 9 third-party stores. In addition, we acquired one store from a third-party operator and converted to a HomeSmart store. And during the quarter, 3 company-operated stores were closed. At the end of the quarter, March 31, we had 1,153 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 710 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 74 HomeSmart stores, 16 company-operated RIMCO stores and 6 franchise RIMCO stores. The total number -- we also had 1 Office store still open. The total number of stores open at the end of March was 1,960. During the quarter, we continued our efforts in selling new franchised stores in the awarded area of development agreements to open 11 additional franchised stores. And at the end of March, we had 223 franchised stores that are under the area of development agreements that are planned to open over the next several years. Our guidance for the second quarter of this year is that revenues of approximately $525 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.44 to $0.48 per share. Our non-GAAP fiscal year 2012 diluted earnings per share which excludes the reversal of lawsuit accrual. Our guidance is $1.96 to $2.08 for the year, which is an increase over the previous guidance of $1.88 to $2.04. Our guidance for the second -- our EPS guidance for the second quarter and for the fiscal year '12 doesn't assume any significant repurchases of company stock. We did not do any repurchase in the first quarter. We still have over 5 million shares authorized. We certainly may repurchase shares from time to time moving forward. We expect to continue this overall new store growth in 2012 in the range 5% to 7% over the same -- over the comp store count at the end of 2011. And for the most part, it will be a little be -- probably a little bit more company-operated than franchised stores, but for the most part, equal amount of stores, and again, as I mentioned, including a handful of the HomeSmart stores. All in all, it's a good quarter for us with a better than the expectations, certainly feel like we have a good momentum going into the rest of the year. So we'll certainly turn it over to any questions anybody may have."
98,GV_001076_2013Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Aaron's first quarter earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Gil Danielson, CFO of Aaron's. Thank you, and enjoy your call. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay, well, thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As is our normal procedure, I'll turn the call over to Lee Wilder, who will read our Safe Harbor statement. Then, we'll have some prepared comments and we'll answer any questions you may have. Lee Wilder Good morning. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued last night and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,in the Investor Relations section. This webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today: Ron Allen, CEO; Dave Buck, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activities for future periods. Ron will start with a few comments, and then Gil will follow with additional information. Ron? Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Lee, thank you very much and, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. As Lee stated, with Gil and myself is Dave Buck, who is our new Chief Operating Officer. Dave is a 24-year veteran of Aaron's and has been 35-plus years in the rent-to-own industry. He moved to Atlanta from Houston in January when he was promoted to Senior Vice President of Operations. Dave's region and stores in Texas over the years have consistently delivered outstanding results, with numerous performance awards and recognitions. I've certainly enjoyed getting to know Dave during my tenure as CEO and greatly respect his abilities. With his operating experience and knowledge of Aaron's and the industry, I'm quite confident that we are in very good hands. Dave will be supported and aided by our long-tenured and very experienced management team throughout all the ranks of the company, especially on the operating side. Dave, it's a pleasure to welcome you as our new Chief Operating Officer. I would also like to extend our best wishes to Ken Butler as he moves on to the next phase of his life. As all of you know, Charlie Loudermilk and Ken Butler led the Aaron's team in developing the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership model that has been so successful for over 2 decades. Aaron's has had dramatic growth over the years, providing our customers with high-quality, basic home furnishings, on payment terms, that they can't afford and many times could not obtain at other retailers. The company has delivered superior financial returns to our shareholders, has had great relationships with our franchisees and our business partners, as well as providing employment to our thousands of associates. All of us thank Ken for his 39 years that he's given to the company, and we all certainly wish him well in his well-deserved retirement. Now during the first quarter, we again received -- we've achieved record revenues. However, these revenues did not meet our growth expectations. However, we must keep in mind that same-store revenue growth of 3.4% is very good in the current economic environment. And although customer traffic was lower than our expectations in both our operating and franchised stores, it still remains robust, considering all the headwinds and the strains on our customer base. Some very positive news in the quarter was achieved in our HomeSmart division. During the first quarter, we were very encouraged by the fact that our performance was above plans and expectations. We currently have 78 company-operated stores and 1 franchised store open. As we said before, we do not anticipate opening any new stores until the latter half of the current year. But as we noted in the earnings release, if current trends and expectations remain positive, we can anticipate adding a significant number of new stores in 2014 and beyond. And by the end of April, we will have our new store operating system installed in all of our HomeSmart stores, and we anticipate this will greatly improve operating performance. And we're still on schedule to have the new store operating system installed in all stores by the end of this year. Again, I thank you for your interest in Aaron's and it's a pleasure now to turn the call over to Dave Buck. Dave? David Buck Thank you, Ron. I just want to say that I'm very happy to be named Chief Operating Officer. I've been with Aaron's Sales & Leasing at the beginning, when we had 24 stores. I operated #16 for a couple of years before moving up into multi-store management. I was also fortunate in helping develop the system with Ken over the last 23 years. I've worked very closely with most of the Divisional Vice Presidents over the last 15 years. Five of the existing Vice Presidents, Operational Vice Presidents, rather, have worked for me prior to them getting promoted. Last night, we had a dinner and flew in all the Operational VPs, had a meeting, and had a very good time. And thank you very much. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Dave. I will just touch on a few of the highlights, financial highlights of the first quarter. Our company revenues increased 2% to the quarter, and it was a record quarter for us in revenues of $595.1 million. In additionally -- additional, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues to $269.5 million for the first quarter, that was also a 2% increase over the same period last year. Our basic lease revenues, which is the core of our business, were up 8% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, a little bit less than anticipated, but very good. Our revenue guidance for the quarter, though, included much more of non-retail sales. If you all recall, non-retail sales are sales of new products to our franchisees. Those non-retail sales, which are very hard to predict for us, were down 21% for the quarter compared with the quarter a year ago. If the non-retail sales had been up at the same rate as the lease revenues, not only would we have had to help our earnings, but we've come pretty close to the $630 million of revenues that we had guided to. Same-store revenue growth in the first quarter for company-operated stores was 3.4%, and it was 1.8% up for stores that are over 2 years old. For stores over 5 years old, which is a metric that the stores certainly, have been around a long period of time, we've had positive same-store revenue growth in those stores of 1.1%. The same-store revenue growth for our franchised stores were up 2.6%, and the customer count was up 6.6% for the quarter. As you all know, revenues and customers of franchisees, however, are not our revenues and customers. As far as the total customer growth was concerned, at the end March, we had just over 1 million, 1.1 million company-operated store customers and 592,000 franchised customers, a 6% increase over the total customers over the same period last year. The customer count, on a same-store basis for company- operated stores, was up 4.1% in the first quarter compared to the quarter last year. Net earnings for the quarter were $51 million versus $71.2 million in last year's first quarter, and EPS for the first quarter -- diluted EPS for the first quarter was $0.67 compared to $0.92 last year. Last year, in the first quarter, we did record into -- income of $35.5 million amount or about $0.28 per diluted share, related to the settlement of a lawsuit. Excluding that income and that reversal of that lawsuit related to accrual, on a non-GAAP basis, our EPS would have increased this year from $0.64 to $0.67, a 5% increase in EPS over the same period last year. And net earnings for the quarter, again, on a non-GAAP basis, would have been up 4% for the quarter as compared to last year. As Ron mentioned, the HomeSmart segment has been encouraged -- very encouraging. Our revenues for the quarter were almost $17 million, and we had a small loss for the quarter, below $200,000. We had actually anticipated in our planning that HomeSmart would have lost around $1 million in the quarter, but it did certainly much better. As we look forward, trends are very encouraging in HomeSmart. We felt -- by the end of this year that if we could just collectively break even for the year in HomeSmart, that would be our plan. I think we're certainly on track to get there and maybe exceed that a little bit, so that's very encouraging in that regard. Our franchise revenues, our royalty revenues from our franchisees were up 4% in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Just from a store activity, during the quarter, we opened 4 company-operated Aaron's stores. We opened 7 franchised stores and 1 RIMCO stores. We also acquired a franchised store and closed a couple Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. At March 31, the end of this quarter, we had 1,230 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 748 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 78 HomeSmart stores, 1 franchised HomeSmart store and the 20 company RIMCO stores and 6 franchised RIMCO stores. The total number of stores at the end of March, as we outlined in the earnings release, was almost 2,100 stores, it's 2,083 stores. Through these 3 months ended March, we did award area development agreements to open 4 additional franchised stores. At the end of March, area development agreements were outstanding for the opening of 176 franchised stores. Those are stores that have been sold to franchisees that are scheduled to open over the next several years. We did revise our guidance for the year. And our guidance for the second quarter, which we didn't have guidance for the second quarter, it would be new guidance. We do expect revenues of approximately $555 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.45 to $0.49 per share. That range includes, approximately, an expected $0.04 per share in onetime charges that will be recorded in the second quarter related to retirement of our COO and a change in the company's vacation policies. For the fiscal year, again, changing that guidance due to the $0.04 per share charge that we anticipate in the second quarter, we now expect diluted earnings per share for the year to be in a range of $2.11 to $2.23. The EPS guidance for the second quarter in the year does not assume any significant repurchases of the company's common stock. Our new store growth plan for 2013 remains unchanged, and we still expect to add stores, new stores in the range of 4% to 6% increase over the store count we had at the end of 2012, for the most part, an equal mix between the company-operated and franchised stores. And we still don't have a firm decision on maybe a handful of HomeSmart stores. We're looking at that and by the next quarter, hopefully, that will clarify what our HomeSmart store opening plans will be if -- this year, if any, and how we kind of see the future on that. We did generate almost $104 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, and we continue, as we kind of say every quarter, that we continue to have positive same-store revenue growth in some of the highest employment areas in the country and just about every state. We've had positive same-store revenue growth since -- including some of the states that have the toughest economic challenges. So that remains very, very positive moving forward. One thing that we did record in the second quarter that, certainly, depressed our earnings a little bit, we've had some assets that had been held for sale for a number years, these are vacant properties and land that we have decided, for a variety of reasons, not to continue to build stores on the properties. And we wrote down those assets during the quarter, we've been writing those assets down periodically for the last 3 or 4 years. We did write down the assets held for sale for about $2 million during the quarter. That went through operating expenses. Obviously, that affected margin during the quarter. And also, affecting the earnings were the decline in non-retail sales. Those are low margin non-retail sales, but we do make money on those sales and that certainly not only had a revenue effect, but it had an earnings effect in the quarter. Those are pretty much the highlights. We'll certainly take any questions anybody may have."
99,GV_001076_2008Q2,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Aaron Rents second-quarter earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gil Danielson. Gil Danielson I am going to turn the call over briefly to Lee Wilder who does Investor Relations work for Aaron Rents. She will read our Safe Harbor Statement and then she will turn the call over to Robert and Charlie and Ken and myself and will have some further comments. </TAG> Lee Wilder My name is Lee Wilder and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron Rents. The company’s earnings release issued yesterday and a related form 8K are available on our website, in the Investor Relations Section. This webcast will be archived for replay there as well. Joining us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman, Robert Loudermilk, CEO, Ken Butler, President of Aaron Sales & Lease Ownership and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor Statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company, as such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demands and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under risk factors in the company's 2007 annual report on form 10K. Including without limitation the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings for future periods. Robert Loudermilk will have a few opening remarks. Charlie Loudermilk will follow and Ken will talk specifically about the Aaron’s sales and lease ownership results and then Gil will add some further information. Robert? Robert Loudermilk Thank you, Lee. I would like to again say that we are quite pleased with our second quarter results that have exceeded both our revenue and earnings expectations. Our associates across the board in all divisions both in the field and the corporate offices have worked extremely hard especially in the past two quarters to achieve this record results. Even in these challenging times, I believe our customers are seeing our products and unique payment programs to reposition our household with traditional credit continuing to comeback in line with historical facts that I believe will continue to see more and more individuals realizing the value of the Aaron’s offerings. Our same store revenue growth in both company operating and franchise store were once again strong in the quarter and we continue to see improvement in our collections as we call renewal efforts nearing our low historical levels. This is again a testament to the hard work of our associates. The flaws of financial results continue to be negatively impacted by the new store startup expenses we call ‘new store drag’ related to all the new stores we have opened in our last 18 to 24 months. As these stores continue to ramp up in revenue and we slow down the pace of the new store openings, this new store drag will continue to subside and should return to a more normal levels of Q4 of this year. Aaron Direct corporate furnishing divisions continue to reposition itself in this tough corporate climate and MacTavish upholstery manufacturing shows an approximately 12% increase for the second quarter and for the same period last year, six month, a 4% increase and we see that continuing as we go into our traditionally busy season in the fall. Going forward, as we have stated our plans for the next several years to grow our store base on average in the 10% to 12% range. This year 2008, our net corporate store growth will be somewhat less than the 10% to 12% as we consolidate and sell stores that have not been achieving our revenue and/or profit goals. This slowdown in yearend growth will allow management to build bench strength and should improve future profitability and overall financial performance. Before I close, I would like to say I am probably one of the luckiest guys alive. We have a great company, built and operated by dedicated associates. My recent promotion to CEO is another chapter and a dream life. Notice that it was impossible without the 53 years of hardworking and personal dedication to this company and associates by our chairman, my father, Charles Loudermilk. I could not ask for a better situation being CEO while have backing foundation and continuing mentoring he provides on a daily basis. I want to thank him publicly for his dedication to this company, myself and our family. Thank you for your support to our company and we will now will continue to turn the call over to Charlie for his comments. Charles Loudermilk Well, thank you Robert. I would say that was an unexpected comment. So, thank you very much for those. It is great to have a son that has the ability that Robert has and let me say to him becoming the CEO, he has been accepted by everyone that I know of and the team is intact. He has done extremely well. I want to thank all of our associates who have made these last two quarters what they are today and I can see where we are going to continue to drive the decision that we made to slow down on store openings has been the right decision and I think that we have a bright future in front of us and Ken, you..? Ken Butler Yes, I am ready. Should we go? Charles Loudermilk I am sorry. I have to thank our people. Okay, get going. Ken Butler Yes I want to reiterate that to you Charlie. There is more price in our management team and all of our associates and franchisees were stepping up in the second and the first quarter of this year to achieve another excellent operating results. We have been working really hard evaluating each and everyone of our underperforming stores and making tough decisions as to whether or not to keep the stores open or these particular stores open or sales or franchisees move a location, change the manager, change the marketing. So, you can see by the recent press release we have been making many of these decisions everyday. We will continue to remain focused on the retention and acquisition of customer base in every market in which we operate. As a results of our customer focus, we gained 45,582 new customers in the second quarter alone. Last year during the same quarter, we gained 22,189 new customers so we have more than doubled last year’s customer growth. Overall business trends are good and our deliveries, collections are all in line with historical numbers and have improved over the last year. July is also a good start as well. LCD televisions continue to lead the way as pricing continues to come down making larger size units more affordable for our customers. Our furniture category continues to improve as a result of more advertising and focus and better payment terms that we initiated back in January. We do think the stimulus check certainly of our business but we never saw a really significant increase in early payouts as we normally see in this traditional tax refund month in January and February. Our franchisees continue to shine with 16% same store sales during the quarter and we awarded an additional 29 store territories during the quarter bringing our pipeline to 285 stores to open in the near future. We will continue to stay on course and focusing our profitability in each in every store in growing our customer base in every community that we operate within. Gil? Gil Danielson Okay, I will just go over a few highlights for the second quarter in the first six months. As you know, company’s revenues increased 15% for the quarter to $411.2 million and 14% for the six months to $848.5 million. Yearend sales on lease ownership revenues increased 16% both in the second quarter and for the six months, the second quarter to $381.4 million and the six months $787.7 million. In addition, our franchisees which are independent operators collectively increased their revenues to a $160.3 million during the second quarter and $327.7 million for the first six months, an 18% and 15% increase respectively over the two periods last year. Revenues of franchisees are not however revenues of Aaron Rents Inc. As Ken mentioned, same store revenue growth in the quarter was strong for the company operated stores that was 4.1% for the stores that were opened over two years, company operated stores the revenue growth, same store revenue growth with 1.5% and again as Ken mentioned the same store revenue growth for the franchise stores with 16.1%. Net earnings for the quarter were $23.3 million or $0.43 per diluted share compared to $0.36 last year, an increase of 19% and for the first six months, net earnings were $40 million and diluted earnings per share for the first half of the year is for $0.89 compared to $0.89 last year. As mentioned in the press release in the second quarter, we had a $3.4 million gain from the sale of some stores to company’s operated to franchisees to a third party operator. If we take that gain, our net earnings on a non-GAAP basis, the earnings for the quarter were $0.39 per diluted share. New store drive for the quarter was $0.06 per share in the quarter, it was last year in the second quarter of ’07 it was $0.04. We had a couple of cents more with this store drive in the second quarter. We did a lot of realignment of stores during the second quarter as outlined in the earnings release and that will continue to evaluate that as we go further as we go through the rest of year. At June 30, we had 993 company operated sales and lease ownerships stores, 480 franchise stores, 30 company operated RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and 60 corporate furnishings stores open for a total of 1,570 stores. As our press release said, we are now back for this year, for 2008 to open approximately 55 to 65 new company-operated stores and also for the same amount, 55 to 65 new franchised stores. We are selling some stores and doing some realignment so the net store growth for this year will be less than 10% probably overall 68%. We do anticipate in ’09 that our square footage growth for ’09, overall combination of company-operated and franchise stores will be in the range of 10% to 13%. We came out with some third quarter guidance, as noted, our guidance for the third quarter is expect revenues in excess of $405 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.37 per share and raised the guidance for ’08, the earnings per share guidance for ’08 to range of $1.54 to a $1.64 per share. That guidance includes the GAAP numbers for the first and second quarter and then our guidance for the third quarter and fourth quarter. We are not assuming in the guidance anymore asset sales and these numbers, there will be some more asset sales that is not assumed in the guidance moving forward and it is now hard predict that. Just a few other data points, the write off as a percentage of revenues continues to improve in the second quarter as the percentage of our sales and lease ownership store level growth revenues. The write off as a percentage of revenues were 2.4% in the second quarter compared to 2.5% in the first quarter and a year ago in the second quarter, it was 2.7% below that the write off are increasing at a slower rate than our revenues so they are definitely improving in that regard. Same store revenue growth plan for the rest of the year, we are assuming that the same store revenue for the third quarter of ’08 and our plan is we are assuming around 4.5% for the same store revenue growth and anticipated increasing as in the fourth quarter to around 6%. That concludes my comment and we will certainly open up the call to any… Charles Loudermilk Let me just say that we passed one goal or had attained the goal. We have over 1 million happy customers today and that is a big goal over the 53 years I have had this company. Gil Danielson We are ready for questions."
100,GV_001076_2009Q2,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Aaron's, Inc. Second Quarter Conference Call. At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Gilbert Danielson with Aaron's, Inc. Thank you, and have a good conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thank you, all for joining us today. With us today is Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, our Chief Operating Officer; and myself. I'm going to turn the call over to Lee Wilder who assists us in Investor Relations. She will read our standard introductory paragraph and our Safe Harbor statement, and then we'll start our prepared comments. Lee? Lee Wilder Good morning. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued yesterday and the related Form 8-K are available on our website  in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today, Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-K, including without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings, and store openings, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Ken and Charlie will have a few opening comments and then Gill will add some further information, and we will have time for questions and answers at the end. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Thank you, Lee. Once again, we are pleased with our second quarter results. Our same-store revenue and customer growth continues to progress nicely and earnings again exceeded expectations. These results are especially strong considering the fact that the government stimulus checks of '08 had more positive effect on the business than previously thought. Providing necessities of home furnishings with no credit checks and the ability to return the merchandise at any time has always been the cornerstone of Aaron's monthly lease ownership program. Our business model, obviously, performed well in this current economic environment as well as through the year's other economic cycles, as our team has proven year in and year out. The dramatic increase in our customer count over the past year or so, coupled with customer accounts increasing at a faster rate than same-store revenues, we believed to be a very positive sign for our business and a reflection of more customers signing the Aaron's flexible programs and attractive alternative through traditional purchase options available. Our MacTavish Furniture of Manufacturing division continue to post positive month-over-month results with upholstery and bedding production up approximately 20% in June '09 over June of '08. We feel our target market is expanding on the upper end and are working hard to make this a permanent part of our marketing strategy as Aaron's becomes more acceptable and attractive to a broader range of consumers while not forgetting our core customers who have brought us to this point. As we have stated throughout this year, our plans for the next several years are to grow an average, our system-wide same- store base in a range of 5% to 9%. This is slower than the past years but a very healthy growth rate. We are on track with these growth plans currently. I want to thank you for your support of the company and I'll now turn the call over to Ken. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Well, thank you, Robin and good morning, and thank you for joining us all today. Our operating results clearly are a sign that our business model remains strong, if our core lease revenues are significantly up over last year. And our same-store sales were up 8.4% for the quarter. Our customer count on a same- store basis is up 15.7% and our same-store growth in the franchised stores is up 9.9%. We are very balanced, geographically, in our growth as we ran a model of our company stores. We met the comp criteria and our same-store customer comp growth is up in every single state that we operate within, and is above 10% in 87% of the states. A little over a year ago, we actually lowered our prices and lengthened the terms in order to make our proposition more attractive. Additionally, prices continue to come down on electronics, and we also have brought in lower-priced goods in the furniture category to attract more customers in these economic times. The result has been tremendous as evidenced by our customer account increases, but has also lowered our average dollar amount that each customer pays each month. That, coupled with price degradation, has impacted our top line number that we sell to our franchisees as our number of units shipped out of the DC centers, or distribution centers, is up over 20%, but actually our total dollar amount of lower margin non-retail sales to franchisees was up only 3%. Our conversion program of converting proven little dealers over to our business model continues to gather this steam as we converted another 16 stores of Aaron's model for the quarter, bringing our total stores converted to 67, including 11 more already on the books in July. Our pipeline for future franchised stores remains strong with 280 stores opening in the next few years and as Robin mentioned, we plan growing on average our company store base of 5% to 9% in the future. With the stimulus checks out last year, we gained 45,000 new customers and we still gained 38,000 new customers in 2009 without the aid of our customers having additional $1,200 in their back pocket. By contrast, we gained 22,000 new customers in 2007 so you get a feel from the anomaly we had in 2008. Our customer growth this quarter, on a graph with previous second quarters, continued to show a strong growth trend. If you do the math and I think you'll agree that business is good in Aaron's, and we appreciate your continued support and the great job of all our employees and suppliers. And I'd like to turn the call over to Charlie now for a few comments. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Thank you, Ken. I want to first thank all of our employees, everyone that's done this great job and continue to do the great job that we've been doing, and we have a great team. My only comment, I guess, is that as I look over the results of our competitors, people in the retail business, I'm very pleased with where we are. We're really in the right business at the right time and we are enjoying a lot of success. Gil, you want to take over? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Charlie. I'll review some of the highlights of the second quarter from financial perspective. The company revenues for the quarter were up 8% to 417.3 million and 11% for the six months to 891.3 million. In addition, as we noted in the earnings release, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues for the quarter and for the sixth month, both 15% over the periods of last year. Revenues of franchisees are not, however, revenues of Aaron's, Inc. The same-store revenue growth in the second quarter, where the Aaron's company-operated stores, as Ken mentioned, was 8.4% and 5.2% for all stores that are over two years old. I think you should also note that for stores over five years old at the end of June, the same-store revenue growth was up 3.6%. Same-store revenue growth for our franchised stores was up 9.9% for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 787,000 corporate customers and 406,000 franchise customers, an increase of 18% over the same period in '08. And the customer count on a same-store basis was up 15.7% for the company-operated stores. The overall revenue was less than originally projected, primarily due to lower non-retail sales. As you recall that non-retail sales are shipments, wholesale shipments and merchandise to our franchisees and also, lesser early payouts on lease agreements on lower revenues of our office furniture stores. The net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were 27.8 million versus 22.4 million in '08, a 24% increase. And net earnings from continuing operations for the six months were 63.2 million versus 44.9 million last year, up 41%. Second quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.51 compared to $0.43 a year ago in the quarter, 19% increase for the six months. Diluted EPS, $1.15 in '09 versus $0.89 in '08, 29% increase. In the second quarter of 2009, the Aaron' Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 19 new company- operated stores and 19 new franchised stores and 1 RIMCO store. We also acquired seven franchised stores and one third-party store during the quarter. In addition, the company sold one company operated to one of our franchisees and closed two stores, and they're also two franchised stores that were closed during the quarter. The new store drag from our new company-operated stores in the quarter was approximately $0.04 per diluted share, compared to $0.06 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Through the three months and six months ended June, we have awarded area development agreements to open 13 and 84 additional franchised stores, respectively. And as we mentioned, there's 280 franchised stores in the pipeline at the end of June that are expected to open over the next several years. At June 30, we had 1,035 company-operated sales on lease ownership stores, 543 franchised stores, 12 company RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and 16 Aaron's Office Furniture stores for a total store count of stores opened at the end of June of 1,613 stores. At the end of the quarter, we had cash on hand of 83.3 million versus a very nominal amount in last year -- or not last year, and 5.9 million in the first quarter of '09. This increase is due to cash flow from generated from operations. Through the six months, we have generated approximately $100 million of cash flow through operations. And also during the quarter, we sold approximately $30 million of real estate stores during the quarter that raised some additional cash for us. Our guidance for the third quarter of '09 is expect revenues of approximately -- these are overall company revenues of approximately 420 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.39 to $0.44 per share. And we revised our revenue guidance for '09 to be approximately, either company revenues will probably be 1.75 billion. Our diluted earnings per share expectations for '09 have been revised. Previously, it was between $1.90 and $2.05 per share, our new guidance to $1.95 to $2.05. Finally, I want to talk about -- we talked a little bit about same store revenues. We had positive same- store revenues in all but one of the 13 states that we do business in that had an unemployment rate of over 10% in June. The government just came out with the unemployment rates in June of all the states in the union. And in the 13 states that we operate, that were over 10%, again, we have positive same- store revenues in all but one. The only one that we didn't have was Nevada. We only have three stores in Nevada. So it's pretty insignificant number of stores, and they were up just slightly. But our same-store revenue growth in the state of Alabama was 15%, 7.9% in Michigan, 14.9% in Ohio, 10.3% in South Carolina, just as a few examples. So as earlier said, that even in high unemployment markets which we're seeing, that we're certainly performing well. We're going to reapply to the same store revenues in all of those markets. So I think that certainly tells you a lot about the strength of our business. And that's our prepared comments. We'll certainly take any questions you may have."
101,GV_001076_2010Q2,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Aaron's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gilbert Danielson. Thank you and enjoy the conference. You may proceed Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you for joining us today. As usual, I'm going to turn the call over to Lee Wilder, who helps us out in Investor Relations and she'll read our Safe Harbor statement and then she'll turn it over to the rest of us for a few opening comments and then we'll turn the call over to questions and answers. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section. This webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic condition, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K, including without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings, store openings and store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Charlie and Ken will have a few opening remarks, then Gil will add further information. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director All right. Thank you, Lee. As I think most of you all saw our second quarter results were as anticipated as we have previously revised our release, previous release. Our core Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership has continues to grow in revenue and customers, even as growth has slowed slightly compared to previous quarters, and therefore, has had a slight negative impact on profitability. We believe the revenue slowdown is a result of our customers being very cautious and tentative in this current economic environment, a very prolonged unemployment and general uncertainty. However, in the quarter, our company-operated stores did have same-store revenue growth of 2.4% and customer growth of 5.6%. In addition, all the net revenue as a variance of peak, our franchised stores experienced a 3.8% growth in same-store revenues and 8.4% increase in same-store customer growth. Now the total of our corporate franchise customers were 11% over the same period last year. Although this growth metrics are at the low end of our historical results, we still feel they're good considering the current circumstances. As credit has tightened, we have attracted customers as expected and I think that the current economic environment continues to be good for our Sales and Lease Ownership business. We continue to see customer gains in some of the highest unemployment markets throughout the country. With some hesitancy, we decided in the quarter, at the end of the quarter, to exit our Office Furniture business. We sold our Legacy Residential Rent-to-Rent business in 2008. At that time, we decided to keep 13 Aaron's Office Furnitures stores. For those of you who have followed the company over the last several years, you know we have recently struggled with the office furniture concept as we once knew it. The Office Furniture business is a highly cyclical and with the economic conditions in the last several years, our stores have constantly experienced declining revenues and not been profitable. We try our best to improve these store performance with no acceptable financial projections in the near term, we felt the right alternative is to put the business behind us. Production in our manufacturing plant has slowed somewhat the first half of the year. Manufacturing shipments were down 11% for the second quarter, compared to the same quarter a year ago and were flat though over at the six-month period. We have changed the name as of the press release, previously stated from MacTavish Furniture Industries to Woodhaven Furniture Industries, a brand that we have used in marketing throughout the years. Our plans for 2010 are unchanged, as we're looking to increase store count of approximately 5% to 9% over a number of stores opened at the end of 2009. We anticipate 2010, our 55th year, to be a challenging one, but yet another excellent year. Thank you for the support for the company. And now I'll turn the call over to Charlie for a few comments and then Ken will talk about the operating results. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, thank you, Robin. We are not immune to what's happening in the economy. We have been hit last, I think, probably in the other chain operation, retail. But we do not rent to people who don't have a job and then when job goes up, our customers goes down somewhat. But we have a tremendous program. The program is strong as it's ever been. We have a good staff to carry this program out, and I think we'll have a good year, not a barnburner but a good year, and we're looking forward to things turning around. But we're here, and we're going to weather any of the storm, no problem. Thank you for your interest. Ken? William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Well, thank you for joining us again this afternoon. Our core business model remains strong, as evidenced of our lease revenues continuing to grow in our core customer base. Our customer count grew over 31,000 new customers over the first quarter and has grown over 130,000 new customers over this time last year, which is an 11% increase combined with company and franchise stores. Over the last two years, we have seen price degradation with our Electronics and it'll push our term on furniture to stabilize sales of our best margin business, which is Furniture, both have made our overall proposition more affordable to our consumers. I believe it's been a very positive change for our transaction as more and more customers are using Aaron's as their choice with our unique lease ownership transaction. Due to the current state of the economy, our customers are being cautious about their budgets, and we think we've made the right moves at the right time. I believe it's healthier for business to fuel this growth by adding more customers than by price increases and having fewer customers. The great news is that more and more customers are coming to Aaron's each and every day. Business in July already look stronger than the past year, and we anticipate continuing to deliver positive results. We remain focused on adding many new company-operated stores in 2010. For the first six months, we've opened 29 and with over 2/3 of the stores slated to open in the last six months of the year. Our franchise pipeline is still strong, with 266 stores to open in the future, and we expected to continue with our conversion of stores as well. In the second quarter alone, we converted 10 former competitor stores over to the Aaron's brand. Our franchisee purchased four of their stores that were conflicts, and we merged one of their stores into our corporate store. The overall transaction will bring in additional $1 million in revenue in the Aaron's system per month. We will continue to pursue these types of transactions in the future. We continue to focus on how we can operate more efficiently when manpower expenses and resources, and expect to continue to deliver positive operating results in the future. I think, Gil, you're going to summarize. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President I will. I'll go over through some of the highlights for the quarter. Company revenues increased 7% for the quarter to $445 million and 5% for the six months to $940.3 million. In addition, our franchisees, although the revenues of the franchisees are not our revenues, they did increase their revenues in the second quarter to 9% to $201.2 million. And for the six months, they had a 12% increase to $421.4 million. Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter for company-operated stores was 2.4%. And it was 1.1% for the stores that are over two years old. For stores that were over five years old, it was slightly down 0.2%. The customer count on a same-store basis for company-operated stores was up 5.6% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Same-store revenues and customer count for franchise stores were up 3.8% and 8.4%, respectively, in the second quarter compared to last year. Again, revenues and customers or franchisees are not revenues and customers of Aaron's, Inc. The company had 859,000 company-operated store customers and 465,000 franchised customers at the end of the second quarter, 11% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the second quarter of '09. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $24.4 million versus $27.8 million in '09. Net earnings from continuing operations for the six months were $61.4 million versus $63.2 million last year. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.30 compared to $0.34 in the quarter last year. And for the six months, diluted earnings per share were $0.75 for '10 and $0.77 for 2009. As we talked about and as we announced on June 29, we are closing our Aaron's Office Furniture division. And the second quarter result included charges of $7.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share related to the closure of this division. We estimate another approximately $2.5 million of charges for, again, approximately $0.02 per share will be expensed over the remainder of the fiscal year to wind down the division. These charges include the write down and cost to dispose of office merchandise estimated future lease liabilities of close stores, write off the lease holds, severance and other associated costs. The revenues of the Aaron's Office Furniture stores were $3.5 million both in the second quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009. The Aaron's Office Store incurred a pretax loss of $8.7 million in the second quarter versus $1.9 million in the second quarter of last year. For the six months, revenues at Aaron's Office Furniture were $7.5 million, compared to $8.8 million for the same period last year, and pretax losses were $10.1 million in the first six months of the year versus $2.8 million in 2009. Again, included in these results are the above-mentioned $7.1 million of second quarter charges. The company's other revenues in the second quarter include a $406,000 asset sales in 2010 and $417,000 in 2009. For the six months, it was $406,000 of asset sales and $6.1 million in 2009. During the second quarter of 2010, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 17 new company-operated stores and 20 new franchise stores. We also acquired five franchised stores and one store from an unaffiliated operator and acquired the accounts of one third-party store. We also sold one company-operated store to a Aaron's franchisee. And three company-operated stores were closed in addition to the Aaron's Office Furniture stores we talked about, eight of those stores were closed in the second quarter. Including three months and six months ended June 30, we have awarded area development agreements to open 28 and 42 additional franchise stores. And at the end of June 2010, there are 266 stores that has been sold that will open in two, three years. At June 30, we had 1,099 company-operated sales and lease ownership stores, 611 franchise stores, 11 company-operated RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and four Aaron's Office Furniture stores opened for a total of 1,732 stores. Again, we anticipate the four Aaron's Office Furniture stores will close by the end of September. At the end of June, we had cash on hand of $85.3 million. Our guidance for the third quarter of 2010 is that revenues would approximately $435 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.29 to $0.33 per share. Our revenue guidance remains the same, we just have to reach approximately $1.85 billion in company revenues. Fiscal year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.44, which again, includes the estimated $0.07 per diluted share cost associated with closing the Office Furniture division. As we mentioned, we anticipate new store growth of 5% to 9% in 2010, again for the most part, an equal, probably a few more company-operated stores and franchise stores. Recently, the company has reacquired 479,000 shares of common stock. And we have current board authorization to purchase a note of 5.4 million shares, and we certainly expect to probably be active with this current stock levels and will be purchasing shares for the company. Those are our comments, we'll certainly turn it over to any questions that anybody may have."
102,GV_001076_2011Q2,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Aaron's Second Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to pass the conference over to your host, Gil Danielson, CFO of Aaron's, Inc. Thank you, and you may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thank you for joining us this evening. I'm going to turn the call over to Lee Wilder who does Investor Relations for the company and she'll read our standards of the Safe Harbor statement, and then we'll get started on the conference call. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today, Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic condition, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments, and then Gil will add some further information. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Thank you, Lee, I appreciate it very much. Obviously, we're pleased with our second quarter results and excluding lawsuit-related charges, met our expectations. As we have said over the years, we feel Aaron's is a recession-resilient business that has performed well in both good and bad economic times. We continue to expand our company and open new stores, and the Aaron's business model has more than proven to be successful throughout the years. We have plenty of growth remaining in our existing Aaron's model and we are very optimistic about the potential of our new HomeSmart weekly pay concept, which we are beginning to roll out. Ken will talk more about this later in the call. Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership business continues to grow in to revenues and customers. In the quarter, revenues were up 9% in the division and our company-operated store had same-store revenue growth of 5% and customer growth of 6.2%. In addition, although not revenue of Aaron's, Inc., our franchise stores experienced a 2% growth in same-store revenues and a 3.9% increase in same-store customer growth. The total of our corporate franchise customers were up 9% over the same period of last year. These growth results are once again excellent, especially in these economic conditions. We expect these trends to continue throughout the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we unfortunately recorded a charge to earnings of $36.5 million related to a sexual harassment judgment as outlined in our earnings release. We strongly believe that the award in this case does not accurately reflect the evidence presented, and we are preparing to file post-trial motions with the court to reduce the size of the award or otherwise appeal the verdict. The charge to earnings this quarter reflects our estimated worst-case scenario if we are not totally successful in reducing the dollar amount of the judgment. On a positive note, our Woodhaven Furniture manufacturing plant increased production in dollars 46% in the quarter and 25% for the year, a reflection of the increased demand, increasing demand by both Aaron's and HomeSmart stores for our furniture and bedding products. Woodhaven is on track for a record year of shipments, approaching $100 million at costs, which is an exciting achievement for all of our associates. Thanks for your support of the company, and I'll now turn the call over to Ken for a few comments and then to Charlie. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Okay. Well, thank you, Robin. Once again, like the first quarter, we got out of the gate with the tremendous weather issues in the month of April and May, with a record number of tornadoes across the Midwest, South and even the Northeast, plus the threat of flooding in the Mississippi River that resulted in not only interruptions to our day-to-day operations, but also store closings and write-offs in merchandise as a result of the disruption caused by these events. There were many acts of heroism from our associates, particularly in Tuscaloosa as one [indiscernible] tornado destroyed the store and the shopping center during normal business hours. Not only did our associates manage to find a safe place in the store, but immediately went to the rescue of others in the center after the tornado passed. Shortly after, I had the opportunity to visit with our associates in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, Missouri, and can only tell you that no words or pictures can describe the devastation they went through these towns and community. Despite these challenges, our great team of associates still managed to gain 34,000 new customers for the quarter and obtain our revenue and profit goals. Our traffic in our stores remains strong and I can attribute that to our national media campaign. Without weather stopping us, we have gotten off to a fast start with our Christmas in July promotion, so our overall business climate is very, very good. Our new HomeSmart concept is gaining quick momentum as we opened 10 new stores during the quarter plus made an acquisition this past week to put us on pace to have 60 HomeSmart stores by the end of the year. Although still early to have a complete financial model, I will say our first store opened became profitable in May and each subsequent store opened since has exceeded Aaron's model in new customer deliveries and average new store drag. The huge advantage we have in this model opposed to someone else opening is we already have an experienced management team in place, a proven operating model, all the back office support in place and a roadmap of the most successful markets to enter. Thus, we can avoid having underperforming stores located in underperforming markets that our Aaron's model has gone through. Aaron's school of hard knocks has opened a superhighway for future HomeSmart expansion. Our main concern was would it cannibalize any of our core Aaron's stores and thus far, we do not see this at all as we monitor this on a day-to-day basis with each store that is open. If we prove out the financial model, we will select from a top tier of our franchisees and give them rights of first refusal for their market, and we feel we can put a big number of stores in our franchisee's hands as well as a big number that we can open in the company as well. We have already got the attention of several independent leaders as evidenced with our recent acquisition of Crusader, as well as some others in the works. Many will have an opportunity to convert to the Aaron's or HomeSmart model or look at this as an opportunity to build their stores. All in all, we are happy with our core Aaron's business as well as our HomeSmart and RIMCO brand. Thank you for your continued interest in us, and I'll turn the call over to Charlie. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, thank you, Ken. I am pleased with the great results of this quarter. With the time as it is and so forth, [indiscernible] people that we have running Aaron's, we have a great team and we [indiscernible] years of work. They have worked very hard. It hasn't been easy, but with all the disaster that's happened, but they stood up and they have done well. I guess the only other thing that I will say, I'm very disappointed with the trial, with the court decision and the write-off that we are having to take. Everything I hear, I would not say everything I hear [ph] from my point of view, he's gotten outlawyered and I think that we will come back and hopefully we'll have a different decision by the court down the road. But the net really is, I'm happy with the quarter and I think we're going to continue to have very good quarters. Everything I see is positive. Thank you. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay, thank you, Charlie. I'll go through some of the highlights of the second quarter and the 6 months. Company revenues increased 8% for the quarter to $482.7 million and also 8% for the 6 months to $1.015 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues to $218 million for the second quarter, an 8% increase over the same period last year and 9% for the 6 months to $459 million. Revenues of franchisees are not, however, revenues of Aaron's Inc. Same-store revenue in the second quarter for Aaron's company-operated stores was 5% and 3.2% for stores that are over 2 years old. For stores that were over 5 years old at the end of June, the same-store revenues were up 1.2%. Same-store revenue growth for the franchise stores were up 2%. The same-store revenues in the second quarter were positive in all parts of the country. The company had 935,000 company-operated store customers and 511,000 franchise customers at the end of the second quarter, a 9.2% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the second quarter of last year. The customer count on a same-store basis for the company-operated stores was up 6.2% in the quarter. As I mentioned, same-store revenues for franchised stores were up 2% and their customer counts, franchised stores, were up 3.9% for the quarter compared to the second quarter a year ago. Again revenues from the customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aaron's Inc. Net earnings for the quarter were $10.8 million versus $24.4 million in 2010. Net earnings for the 6 months were $55.2 million versus $51.4 million last year. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.13 compared to $0.30 last year, and for the 6 months, diluted earnings per share was $0.58 versus $0.75 a year ago. As mentioned, in the second quarter, a charge to lawsuit expense for $36.5 million was recorded, which result from the judgment on the lawsuit and expenses less our insurance coverage that we would have. Excluding the charge, and this would be a non-GAAP number, net earnings for the quarter would have been $33.3 million and diluted earnings per share $0.41. During the second quarter of 2011, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division opened 17 new company-operated stores, 12 new franchised stores, 10 HomeSmart stores and one RIMCO store. We acquired the accounts for 1/3 party store, also full 5 company-operated stores, 2 in Aaron's franchisee and one store to an independent operator. Eight company-operated stores and 2 franchised stores were closed in the second quarter. We still have one store remaining in the Aaron's Office Furniture division and it's outlined in the press release. The revenues were quite small and it was a positive gain both in the second quarter and for the 6 months. For the 3 and 6 months ended June 30 of this year, the company awarded area development agreements to open 38 and 44 additional franchised stores at the end of June of this year. There were 270 such franchised stores awarded that are expected to be opened over the next several years. At June 30, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,143 company-operated stores, 681 franchised stores, 12 company-operated RIMCO stores, 15 HomeSmart stores and 6 franchised RIMCO stores. Again, we also had the one Aaron's Office Furniture store. The total number of stores opened at the end of June 2011 was 1,858. At the end of June, we had cash on hand of $176 million. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we received $125 million as a result of private placement of senior notes with payment of interest only for 2 years and then a notes mature out in 5 equal installments of $25 million each over the next 5 years. The borrowing rate on these notes is 3.75%. These funds will be used for general corporate purposes and for the repurchases of stock from time to time. We did repurchase stock during the quarter. As you recall or as you've seen in May, Board of Directors approved and authorized repurchase of additional 5.9 million common shares, bringing a total of common shares authorized to 10 million. During the quarter or during the 6 months, we have acquired 1.454 million shares of common stock and we have current board authorization to purchase an additional 8.9 million shares. The average price we paid in the first 6 months of this year is worth $25.75 or about -- just a little bit more than $37 million. We generated over $57 million in cash flow from operations in the second quarter and over $200 million for the first 6 months of 2011. Our guidance for the third quarter of this year 2011 is, is that revenues of approximately $480 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.35 to $0.39 per share. Our revenue guidance for 2011 remains unchanged, to reach approximately $2 billion in revenues. And fiscal year 2011 diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.73 to $1.81, which is updated from previous guidance. This fiscal 2011 guidance is a non-GAAP number and excludes the second quarter's $0.28 per diluted share -- EPS share charge for the lawsuit. That's our prepared comments, and we'll certainly turn the call over for any questions that you anybody may have."
103,GV_001076_2012Q2,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon and welcome to the Aaron's Inc. Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Mr. Gil Danielson. Thank you and have a good conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. As usual, I'm going to turn it over to Lee Wilder who does the Investor Relations for Aaron's and she will read our standard Safe Harbor statement and then we'll begin the conference call. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Ron Allen, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors, such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2011 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Ron, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments, and then Gil will add further information. Ron? Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you, Lee, and thank all of you for joining us today. We're quite pleased to report another outstanding quarter. The Aaron's management team is executing as planned. Our business continues to grow as expected and demand remains strong for the basic home furnishings we offer. Our customers, although they're struggling for a long period of time now with these difficult economic times, desire and need our products to continue their daily lives. The customer experience with Aaron's is built on a very close relationship with Aaron's store associates and customers benefit from the superior service, the flexible payment plans, no credit checks and the overall attention we give them in helping fulfill their needs. It has been the key to our success for so many years. As we said before, we believe high consumer credit is actually a positive for our business. However, high unemployment levels are more of a negative. These market conditions probably will not change anytime soon, but we see no reason at this time that Aaron's should not continue to perform well in the upcoming quarters. Now, our HomeSmart stores are getting revenues and customers, and results of the stores continue to be encouraging. There is still effort needed to perfect the model and our plans are unchanged for store openings with just a few more stores expected to be open before the end of this year. We anticipate having enough experience for the HomeSmart probably by the fourth quarter of this year to make more specific plans towards future development. Recently, we have been employing additional resources to improve our recruiting, our training, our associate resource functions to enhance our planning process and we started several new store selection and development initiatives and we're continuing to improve our information technology to enable our associates to better serve our customers. We are investing in these resources to strengthen and ensure the foundation is in place to meet our future growth objectives. And finally, I've been spending a significant amount of time recently visiting our operating management and associates in the many regions and stores across the country. Just last week, Gil and I spent 2 days with Michael Ryan, our VP of northern operations and his team. I still have a lot of stores to visit and associates to meet, but I can tell you, I've been extremely impressed with our management team and our associates throughout the organization. Aaron's is truly a very special company with great people, a superior business model, a long history of outstanding financial performance and returns to our shareholders. And I look forward to continuing to report the company's future progress. Thank you again for your support and interest in Aaron's and now, Ken will talk about some of the results of the quarter. And as a conclusion of Gil's comments, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Ken? William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes. Well, good evening, everyone. And as Ron mentioned business remains strong, evidenced by another quarter of strong customer growth. For the 3-month period, we added another 44,655 customers to our portfolio, representing a 14.2% increase over last year's customer count. All of this resulted in a robust 6.1% increase in same-store sales and company stores and a 7% increase in same-store sales in the franchise community. Believe me, we don't take this success for granted because I'm proud of our fellow associates and franchisees who serve our customers each and every day. They continue to meet and beat every challenge and new initiative that we place before them. In addition to our strong customer growth, we had a very active quarter in adding new stores with 18 new company-operated stores, and 11 new franchise stores opened. We also acquired 12 franchised stores. This countdown is now getting very close to us celebrating our 2,000th store. Five of those stores opened for the quarter are our HomeSmart brand, 1 being our first franchised store. We have 3 or 4 more company stores set to open this year and we're slowing the growth down so management can catch up with our aggressive growth, thus far, as well as refining the model. We remain very optimistic about the future for HomeSmart as customer growth and traffic is risk and most importantly, with 78 stores open, we see no cannibalization to the nearest Aaron's location. Our business fundamentals are sound and our program widely accepted by our target customer base. We're very excited about the new store operating system currently being developed by our IT team, which will be a vast improvement from our current system. Our IT development team has been working literally around the clock to launch our new store operating system. They will be designed for more stores and to handle more customers. We should have a couple of hundred stores on the new system by year's end and the balance of the stores in the first half of 2013. Recently, our regional managers were given a sampling of the system and literally gave the IT team raving reviews. In conclusion, we remain focused on delivering excellent results in the future. And I'm going to turn the call over to Charlie for a few comments. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, thank you, Ken. Number one, I want to thank all of the people on the team. 11,000 people have built this company and is running the company extremely well. I think from the numbers, you're going to see that in fact. First thing I'm looking forward to growing out HomeSmart. It's a tremendous opportunity there, but we need to be very cautious on how we're going to do it, but I'm very, very enthused over doing this. The numbers look now like we can do -- make a real impact on the company about having this real good program. Here again, I want to thank everyone. I know a lot of you listening to this call, I personally want to thank you for all the work you've done. Not only now, in the last quarter or 2 but with all the years that we've been building this company. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay. Well, thank you, Charlie. I'm going to review the financial highlights for the quarter. It was another great quarter for us, as you have read in our press release tonight. Had a lot of strong revenue growth. The company revenues for the quarter increased 12% and revenues for the 6 months were up 11%. Company revenues for the quarter were $539.5 million and $1.126 billion dollars for the 6-month period. Our franchisees continue to build their revenues and had another, also another good quarter. Their revenues were up 9% for the quarter and also 9% for the year's and for the 6 months -- and for the 6 months they did $502 million in revenue. Those are revenues of the franchisees, their storefront revenues. They are not revenues of Aaron's Inc. Same-store revenue growth in the second quarter for the company stores was 6.1%. and 4.3% for stores that were over 2 years old. For stores over 5 years old, the same-store revenue growth was 3.3%. Franchised stores again, have positive same-store revenue growth. Their same-store revenue growths were quite strong in the first quarter and also in the second quarter. Same-store revenue growth for the franchised stores was up 7% for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. A good company-operated customer growth and franchised growth as we noted in the press release at a 14.2% increase in total customers at the end of June compared to the same period a year ago. The customer count on a same-store basis for our company-operated stores was up 8.8% in the quarter compared to the second quarter last year. The -- as I mentioned, the same-store revenues for the franchised stores were up 7% for the quarter. Net earnings for the quarter were $36.2 million versus $10.8 million in the same quarter last year. And net earnings for the 6 months were $107.5 million this year versus $55.2 million last year. Our diluted earnings per share were $0.47 this quarter compared to $0.13 for the quarter last year. And for the 6 months, the diluted earnings per share were $1.40 versus $0.58 for 2011. As we've talked about numerous times over the last year or so, we did have the accrued lawsuit expense that we recorded in the second quarter of 2011 a year ago and a charge of $36.5 million. We subsequently settled that lawsuit and reversed over $1 million of that accrual in the first quarter of this year. And that effect was $35.5 million of income in the first quarter or $0.29 per diluted share. If you exclude all the lawsuit-related charges and reversals, net earnings for the second quarter would have been $36.2 million in this year compared to $33.3 million last year, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.47 in this second quarter compared to $0.41 last year, which will be a 15% increase in the diluted earnings per share this quarter compared to last quarter. For the 6-month period, earnings again, net earnings without all the litigation expense, charge and the subsequent reversal, net earnings for the quarter with $85.5 million compared to $77.7 million last year and diluted earnings per share would have been $1.11 versus $0.96 last year, a 16% increase. As noted in our earnings release, we have a reconciliation of those numbers in the back of the earnings release. The revenues at HomeSmart division continue to grow. Revenues in the quarter over $13.7 million compared to -- it was just starting out last year, the $157,000 last year and the same quarter last year. For the 6 months, the revenues at HomeSmart division were $26.2 million compared to just a little bit less than $1 million last year. Again, we started the HomeSmart stores, all the HomeSmart stores system is about 1-1/2 year old but it just started ramping up back in 2011 and has ramped up as expected in revenues and also in earnings and so, has had a lot of revenues for us this year. Franchised revenues were up 6% for the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. And for the 6 months, franchised revenues were up 7% compared to the prior year. At the end of June, the company had 1,176 company-operated Aaron's sales and leased ownership stores; 706 Aaron's sales and lease ownership franchised stores; 78 HomeSmart stores; 1 franchised HomeSmart stores; 17 company- operated RIMCO stores; and fixed franchise stores goes at 1 Office Furniture store remaining for our total store count at the end of June with 1,985 stores. We continue to award area development agreement to companies, individuals who want to become franchisees. And during the quarter, we awarded area development agreement to open up additional 18 additional franchised stores. Our backlog, our pipeline of stores, franchised stores that have been reserved and deposits made to open in the future was 222 stores at the end of June. Our guidance for the third quarter of 2012 is that revenues with approximately $530 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.40 to $0.44. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the lawsuit charges and credits, our guidance for our non-GAAP guidance for 2012 of diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.98 to $2.06. And the EPS guidance in the third quarter and the fiscal year does not assume any significant repurchases of company stock. And again, our new store guidance is the same and the earnings guidance and revenue guidance has not really changed since last quarter. We continue with that new store growth in the range of 5% to 7% this year. And well, for the most part, an equal-ness between company-operated and franchised stores. And including of a handful of HomeSmart stores right now, at the end of June, we had 78 HomeSmart stores. It looked like there's 3 or 4 more stores that will probably open undoubtably before the end of the year, which will bring us to a little bit more than 80 stores by the end of 2012. Our manufacturing plants continue to do well. They did increase production, it says for $10, 6% for the quarter. And basically, that's a reflection of the increased demand by our Aaron's stores for our furniture and bedding products. Those are the highlights of the quarter. We'll certainly take any questions people may have."
104,GV_001076_2013Q2,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Aaron's, Inc. second quarter earning conference call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gil Danielson with Aaron's, Inc. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you. Thank you, all, for joining us today. With us today is Ron Allen, our CEO; Dave Buck, Chief Operating Officer; and myself, the CFO. I'm going to turn it back real quickly to the operator who's going to read our standard Safe Harbor statement. And after that's done, we'll start. We'll have a few prepared comments, probably won't take too long, 5 or 10 minutes, and then we'll open it up to any Q&A that may come up. So operator? Operator Certainly. The company's earning release issued last night and the related Form 8-K are available on the company's website in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for a replay there as well. Before the results are discussed, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and regulatory investigations and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risk and uncertainties discussed on the risk factors in the company's 2012 annual report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about the company's future revenues, earnings, store openings, store acquisitions, disposition and accruals for legal and regulatory loss contingencies. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Allen. Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you very much, Rochelle, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining us today. Aaron's continued to grow in the second quarter, although certainly less than what we were expecting. During the quarter, total revenues, same-store revenues and customer accounts were all up, and we did see a small uptick in the average -- the amount of average monthly payments. But revenues were again negatively affected by a decrease in non-retail sales to our franchisees. Now this certainly is a reflection of the slower business and corresponding less demand for products from our franchisees. But earnings, excluding charges, were within guidance. Our new store opening plans were on track for the year, and at this time, we anticipate continued new store growth into 2014. We do expect record revenues for the year 2013 and an increase in non-GAAP net earnings. As we face the last 6 months of this year, we are working very hard on adding new business during the remainder of the year and have several new promotions planned over the next several months to stimulate demand and to grow both revenues and customers. Our HomeSmart division results did not meet our expectations during the quarter. HomeSmart customers had experienced the same economic stresses of our Aaron's customers. But several management changes during the quarter, including the departure of the gentleman running the division, negatively affected its performance. Now to put a proper emphasis on the development of HomeSmart and add a higher level of management attention and capability, Tristan Montanero, our Senior Vice President of Operations, is now devoting 100% of his time in the leadership of HomeSmart. We have also added 2 industry veterans as directors to assist Tristan with strengthening and growing the division. We remain strongly committed to HomeSmart, and we plan to open an additional 5 stores before the end of this calendar year. And we do anticipate opening a significant number of stores in 2014 and beyond, and we will be announcing those plans later on in the year. As discussed in the earnings release, the earnings for the quarter were affected by several special charges. We've had a pending regulatory investigation by the California Attorney General for a number of months now relating to Aaron's leasing, marketing and privacy practices. We're continuing to cooperate in the investigation, and while its outcome is uncertain, we anticipate achieving a comprehensive resolution without litigation. Now most of you know that during the first 6 months of the year, we have experienced quite a few management changes in the company. But in every case, I feel our team has been strengthened by the experienced people who've been promoted to their new position. In addition, we have brought in experienced talent from outside of Aaron's when necessary to fill critical roles. One example of this is Robbie Kamerschen who joined Aaron's in June as Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Robbie has had a lengthy career in corporate legal counsel and corporate governance, especially in regulatory matters similar to those in our industry. He's an outstanding addition to the management team. Without a doubt, our leadership group is more unified today as a team, working toward our goals of growing our customers and revenues and producing solid sustainable financial performance for our shareholders. Again, I thank you for your interest in Aaron's, and now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Dave Buck. Dave? David L. Buck Former Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Ron. As I wrap up my first 3 months as Chief Operating Officer, I have to say how proud I am to work the work that our 12,000 associates have been doing. I've received a great deal of support. I'm excited as ever about what we have and what we can accomplish. Although I am new in the position, I have been in the industry for 30 years, with Aaron's for over 24 years. And during that time at Aaron's, I've developed an excellent and closer relationship with our operational management team. In particular, we have an amazing divisional vice presidents as a group, representing over 150 years of industry experience. This management team knows how to execute in growing Aaron's and have proven this many times over, as demonstrated by the company's superior operating financial performance through the years. I am pleased that our Senior Vice President, Tristan Montanero, has taken the challenge of leading our important HomeSmart division. HomeSmart is in good hands with Tristan. I stand ready to call on my many years of experience in the weekly rental industry to support Tristan and his team in any way I can. I'm excited to announce the promotion of Martin Fontella [ph] to the newly created New York, New Jersey expansion market. Martin was our Regional Manager of the Year for 2012. I am confident that he will make an immediate impact in this important growth area for the company. We believe New York, New Jersey will be an excellent market for us, and we have just begun to tap a very large potential. I'm encouraged by the customer activity that we've experienced in our stores as evident by our increased deliveries. And the fact that during the second quarter, our company-operated and franchise stores together gained 26,952 customers. We expect these trends to continue in the third quarter and the balance of the year. Over the coming months, I'm looking forward to getting out and traveling with our operational leaders, visiting stores in many areas of the company. Although our customers continue to face economic challenges, we are making every effort to ensure we remain the first choice when they are in need of household furnishing, electronics, appliances and computers. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Gil. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thank you, Dave. I'll briefly touch on some of the financial highlights of the second quarter. Company revenues increased 2% for the quarter to $552.1 million and 2% for the 6 months to $1.147 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues 4% for the second quarter and 3% for the 6 months. The revenue at the end of 6 months was $518 million. Revenues of franchisees, however, are not revenues of Aaron's, Inc. Lease revenues and fees were again up. They were up 5% for the second quarter for the company and 6% for the year. Our non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of new merchandise to our franchisees were again down in the quarter. They were down 10% in the quarter and 15% for the year. Again, we're seeing less shipments to our franchisees, primarily mainly because of less demand for the products by the franchisees. The same-store revenue growth in the second quarter for our company-operated stores was 1.9%, and it was 0.6% for the stores over 2 years old. For the stores over 5 years old, it was basically flat, and it was down about 0.3%. The customer count on a same-store basis for the company-operated stores was up 1.6% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Same-store revenues for franchised stores were up for the quarter 1.7% comparable to our company-operated stores, and the customer count was up 3.3%. The company had 1,128,000 company-operated store customers at the end of June and 599,000 franchised customers. This is a 5% increase in total customers for the same number of customers we had at the end of the second quarter of 2012. Our net earnings -- our GAAP net earnings for the quarter were down to $25.9 million versus $36.2 million last year, and again, the GAAP earnings for the 6 months were down to $76.9 million compared to $107.5 million a year ago. EPS -- GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.34 compared to $0.47 last year same quarter, and for the 6 months, our GAAP earnings per share is $1 compared to $1.40. As was explained in the earnings release, during the second quarter, we recorded an expense of $15 million relating to a regulatory investigation that's been ongoing for a while. And we also, as we've previously announced in our guidance at the end of the first quarter, we had about $4.9 million or $0.04 diluted shares charge in this quarter related to some retirement and vacation-related expenses. And again, looking at the non-GAAP net reconciliation, which is in our earnings release, a year ago, we had an extraordinary item, also a reversal of a lawsuit that happened during the first 6 months of 2012. So excluding those adjustments, diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis would have increased to $0.50 a share from $0.47 a year ago and be up 6% over the same period last year. And net earnings would have increased to $38.6 million compared to $36.2 million a year ago for the 6 months. That'd be a 7% decrease. Again, on a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $1.17 versus $1.11 for the 6 months ended -- period of end of June and net earnings would've been up 5% for the 6 months for the same period. Revenues of the HomeSmart division were up 16% for the quarter compared to a year ago to about $15.8 million, and HomeSmart revenues for the first 6 months were $32.7 million versus $26.2 million a year ago. During the second quarter of 2013, we opened 5 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 12 franchised stores and 2 RIMCO stores. We've also acquired 2 franchised stores, and 2 company- operated and 2 franchised stores were closed during the quarter. At the end of June, we had 1,235 company-operated Aaron's stores, 756 franchised Aaron's stores, 78 HomeSmart stores, 1 franchised HomeSmart store, 22 RIMCO stores and 6 franchised RIMCO stores opened. Total number of stores opened at the end of June was 2,098. So certainly, as we sit here today, we've gone over the 2,100 mark in new store openings. During the 3 and 6 months ended June, we awarded area development agreements to open 9 and 12 additional franchised stores. Our backlog of franchised stores, they have been sold, and we received money down and deposit to open in future periods is 168 franchised stores at the end of June. Our guidance for the third quarter is expect revenues of approximately $550 million and the diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.48 to $0.52 per share. Our fiscal year guidance on revenues reduced just slightly to $2.3 billion over the previous guidance of last quarter of $2.35 billion. We now expect GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.98 to $2.06 for the year, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was taking into consideration the adjustments we talked about of being $2.15 to $2.23. Those are the noteworthy financial highlights for the quarter. We'll certainly call open to any questions anybody might have."
105,GV_001076_2008Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen, and welcome to the Aaron Rents third quarter earnings call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gilbert Danielson. Gilbert L.

Robin will have a few opening comments; then Ken will follow up from that and then Charlie will add some comments and then at the end I’ll add some further information and then we’ll take questions from the participants. Robert C. Loudermilk As you can probably tell we’re quite pleased that our third quarter of 2008 exceeds our revenue and earnings expectations. Even in these difficult recessionary times, customers seek our stores to acquire the basic home furnishing products. As credit tightens further and more Americans experience income challenges, I believe we will continue to see an increase in our business as more and more individuals see the value of the Aaron’s non-credit based monthly pay programs. Same store revenues in both company operated and franchise stores was once again strong even though as best we can tell over 100 of our system stores were affected by the Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. This is a direct result of the hard work of all of our associates to quickly recover from the devastation and once again provide products and services to our customers in these areas. Our earnings were negatively impacted in the quarter by at least $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share by the effect of the hurricanes. These financial results continue to be negatively impacted by the new stores’ startup expenses we call drag we have opened in the last year or so. This new store drag is a price we pay to create new revenues and earnings for future quarters. As we have slowed down our new store growth this year to a 10% to 12% range, this new store drag will return to more normal levels in the future periods. As announced earlier we are in the process of completing the sale of our Aaron’s Corporate Furnishings division. Again, I want to thank all of our Corporate Furnishing associates for their hard work over the past 50 years. This will allow us to focus on our faster growing large market Aaron’s sale/lease ownership concept. As we’ve always said, be successful in this business and Ken will certainly attest we have found many times we must focus on the renting and renewing from our existing customer base. Our plans the next several years are to grow an average store base in the rage of 10% to 12% a year. The net store growth this year will be less in 2008 as we consolidate and sell some stores that have not been achieving acceptable profit goals. This slower growth will be a more consistent, predictable and efficient manner and should improve future profit margins and overall financial performance. We again thank your support in the company and I’ll now turn the call over to Ken. William K. Butler Good morning. The best description of the quarter is to relate it to a football game and we had a tremendous lead until late in the game and lost our momentum as three hurricanes hit us within a short period, affecting hundreds of stores on the Eastern seaboard to the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas and turned into tropical storms that impacted our business all across the Midwest. In spite of that we remain focused and still won the game. It should not have been as close as the score indicated. We have quickly recovered from these events as we are having a record month in October in terms of new customer growth. During the quarter we gained 25,747 new customers and that is the largest customer gain in a third quarter going back the last five years. Our same store sales were at 5.7% and our franchise comps are at 18.4%. During the quarter we initiated a 20% instant rebate program in July to help stimulate our retail sales and we immediately saw a 41% increase over the third quarter of 2007. This is without any advertising or marketing initiatives. We are awaiting the completion of the CORT acquisition of our Corporate Furnishings division and we want to take a moment and thank all those who have been a part of that division. Without them and their support as Robin mentioned, Aaron’s Sales and Lease Ownership would not exist and I know many of you will be going to CORT, Aaron’s or elsewhere and I wish you much success in the future. CORT is not buying all the merchandise and we have teams waiting in the wing to begin transferring inventory to our stores to offer a great value to our customers. In the spirit of teamwork, many of our franchises are planning on acquiring some of the product. What we cannot place on a lease agreement we will dispose of through clearance sales. We think we can liquidate all of this inventory over the next six months. Our strengths remain in that we have the right program with the right people, the right products and at the right time. I read an article five days ago about the five towns in the U.S.A. who are the most hardest hit due to national and local economic issues. Four of the five towns we have an Aaron’s store operating. They are Palatka, Florida, Lancaster, South Carolina, Shelby, North Carolina and Zanesville, Ohio. I looked at the performance reports of each of these stores and saw no reason to be alarmed or concerned about their ability to continue operating as their numbers were right solid. I consolidated all their numbers so I could share them with you today. Last year for the third quarter, their revenue average per month was $104,000. This year in the quarter their average revenue is up to $117,000 per month, representing an 11.7% increase. In 2007, their average profit per month in the third quarter was $7,200 per month per store and this year in 2008 the four stores averaged $15,517 per month. I give you these numbers only so you can examine the strength of our program and what someone from the outside determined were the toughest markets to stimulate growth. Our customers are telling us that no matter what the circumstances are, that they need our products and they are doing the math to choose where they shop in these tight market conditions. They like our monthly pay program and they love our selection and most importantly they love saving money. We have positioned ourself well for the future and tomorrow and remain focused on continuing to deliver exceptional operating results. R. Charles Loudermilk I think I want to emphasize what Robin said about the focus and we’re not going to be, as long as I’m around, a check cashing business or a pawn shop or payday loans. We’re going to focus on what we know how to do. After 51 years we have really come up with the right program at the right time; the right business at the right time. And to emphasize that we are selling our rent-to-rent division to CORT. It’s just a matter of closing that; it’s been okayed by everyone, the government and everything. So the future looks very, very bright; I’m very enthused over particularly our team. We have a team together now that I’m very proud of both in the home office and out in the field: the district manager, regional manager, every general manager of the stores. They really know what they’re doing and how they’re doing it and this is the test of what our training program is doing out in the field. We train people every day on how to come with our program. It’s a different program than anyone else in America has and it’s working extremely well; I’m very pleased to be with the company as the Chairman. Gilbert L. Danielson I’ll just highlight some of the results for the third quarter and the first nine months. As we stated we are in process of selling substantially all the assets of the Aaron’s Corporate Furnishing division. We expect the sale to close probably within the week so we’re getting close to having that done. Beginning with the third quarter results and moving forward, we will no longer include the revenues and expenses of the Aaron’s Corporate Furnishings division on our statement of earnings; just the net earnings of the division are in that one line item from discontinued operations. Since we didn’t record the revenues of Aaron’s Corporate Furnishings any more, our revenues were less than what was expected but as we add the revenues of the Corporate Furnishings division into our reported revenues we certainly exceeded our revenue projections for the third quarter also and on track for the entire year revenue projection. For the quarter the company revenues increased 16% to $388.0 million and 15% for the nine months to almost $1.2 billion. The Aaron Sales and Lease Ownership division’s revenues increased 17% in the third quarter and then also 15% for the nine months. We talk a lot about our franchisees; they also had a great quarter and having a great nine months. They increased their revenues in the third quarter to $166 million and $493.7 million for the first nine months. The revenue increase in the third quarter for them was 26% and 19% for the nine months. However, as we stated before revenues of franchisees are their revenues; they’re not revenues of Aaron Rents, Inc. Same store revenue growth in the third quarter for the Sales and Lease Ownership stores, the company stores was 5.7%. It had accelerated from where it has been in the last few quarters as we predicted it would. For stores that were over two years old, those were for stores that were over 15 months old at 5.7%. For stores over two years old the increase was 3.2% and as Ken mentioned, the same store revenue growth for franchise stores, their growth was up 18.4% for the quarter compared to a year ago. Net earnings for the quarter were $21.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share compared to $0.29 for this quarter of last year, an increase of 34%. Diluted earnings per share for the first nine months of the year were $1.28 compared to $1.18. If we look at diluted earnings per share from continuing operations which includes Aaron’s Corporate Furnishings division, the earnings per share for the continuing operations increased 42% for the quarter and 12% for the nine month period. As we mentioned, over 100 of our stores were adversely impacted by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike and we estimate that the hurricanes negatively affected our quarterly earnings by at least $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share including the loss of merchandise that incurred in our customers’ homes. The new store drag as Robin mentioned was $0.05 per diluted share for the third quarter compared to $0.06 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. During the quarter the Aaron Sales and Lease Ownership division opened four new company operated stores, 12 new franchise stores and one franchise RIMCO store. We also sold 11 company operated Sales and Lease Ownership stores to three different franchisees and we closed four company stores during the quarter. In addition we acquired one franchise store and purchased the accounts of three third party stores. Our guidance for the fourth quarter is to expect revenues in excess of $410 million and to achieve earnings per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.37 per share and again for the 2008 year is to have revenues approximately $1.6 billion. The Aaron’s Corporate Furniture division was running about $100 million a year so that would reconcile to our previous forecast of $1.7 billion in revenues. We are raising slightly our diluted earnings per share guidance for ’08 to a range of between $1.60 and $1.55 per share. And our initial guidance for 2008 is to achieve diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.80. Those are the highlights of the quarter. We will certainly turn it over to any questions that we may have from the participants."
106,GV_001076_2009Q3,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Aaron's Inc. Third Quarter Conference Call. At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gilbert Danielson with Aaron's Inc. Thank you, and have a good conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. As usual, I'm going to turn the meeting over to Lee Wilder who'll assist us in investor relations and she'll read our opening comments and our Safe Harbor statement. And then we'll turn it over to Robin and Ken, and Charlie will have a few comments. And then I'll follow up. So, Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in investor relations for Aaron's Inc. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section. And this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are; Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements; including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings, and store opening, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Charlie and Ken will have a few opening comments and then Gil will add further information, followed by Q&A. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Well, thank you, Lee, I appreciate it. Our third quarter results were very good and certainly met our expectations. Our same-store revenue and customer growth continues to be outstanding, as our associates in both the company and the franchise arena continue to execute our industry-leading lease ownership model. The results, frankly, were especially strong considering that the government's stimulus checks of last year probably had a more positive effect on our business revenue than we have previously thought, looking back over the year. And the product price inflation we are expecting currently, which we are able to turn into a positive today, we're offering our customers a better value in our product categories that really associate as a negative, but really, I think helped our model and helping us to give our customers better and more full-featured products. Providing with home furnishings with no credit checks, and they can return the merchandise anytime has always been the cornerstone of our program. Our business model actually works well in the current economic environment. Although as you know, we've done very well through the years in all types of economic cycles, especially in the last three or four years, we're growing double digit rates. So I think that any concern out there that our business may turn as the economy gets better, I do not believe it's well-founded. I think we'll continue to do well. We've increased our customer counts over the past year or so, with customer counts increasing at faster rate than our store revenues. Again, have a little bit to do with that price deflation we're seeing, and we have stretched our payment terms to make our products more attractive. We feel very positive for our business and reflects that more customer deciding that Aaron's offering is very attractive to them. We feel the market is expanding on the upper end helps us in the permanent expansion. We feel that more -- our customers will see us an acceptable and attractive to consumers and spread the word throughout the community. Aaron's Office Furniture stores, a handful, a dozen or so, continue to adversely affect our overall financial performance. If you may remember, we sold our core Rent-to-Rent business, our legacy Rent-to-Rent business over a year ago. We ended up with a few Office Furniture stores. We are in the process of turning those around, get a few stores, selling off inventory, creating cash and putting in new rental lines. We're putting plans into effect to improve the structural results of the future. Aaron's furniture industries manufacturing continues its year-over-year quarterly growth trend. We're seeing positive results there, as we're moving more and more furniture products throughout our system. As we stated throughout the year, our plans for the next several years is to grow on average, our store base in the range of 5% to 9% a year. In 2009, we'll peak in the upper the end of that, growth rate should be 7% to 8% of our net store growth. After all, the company, just as we do with franchised existing stores, et cetera. We are proactive on the regulatory issues in Washington. I think Washington is very active right now. We feel we are making some positive headway, in Washington, with a lot of the meetings and issues that we are talking about with the Senators and Congressman, et cetera. And I just want to thank you for your support of the company. And I'll turn the call over to Charlie Loudermilk for a few comments. And then Ken will talk about the operating results. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, thank you, Robin. One thing I want to do is just thank all the employees and all of our team for what they've done in, I think, the last quarter, but last year. In many years, I know quite a few are listening in on this conference call, and I want to especially thank them, as well as all of the other employees for their hard work. Running a rental company is not easy, and they're giving it a good shot and results show well. So we're happy where we are, and I just want to thank everyone. And, Ken? William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes, well, good evening and we thank you for your continued interest in Aaron's, and for staying with us tonight. Many people think that our company is recession-proof. And we like to use a term recession- resistant, instead. We're still very similar to a jet airplane, and that we can fly through thunderstorms and turbulence and still maintain altitude and speed. But at the end of the day, I think everyone would rather fly when the skies are clear. We prefer a stronger economy, but history has proven that we can still grow through the tough times. But we're growing and better when everyone's striving. Our same-store sales for the quarter are up 6.3% over 2008 and our customer count on the same-store basis is up 12.3% over the same quarter a year ago. At the end of the third quarter, we had 789,000 active customers in our company stores and 416,000 active customers in our franchised store. This, combined, represents a 16% increase in overall customer count over the last year. This is our key metric to determine the overall health of our business and shows that our program continues to be kind of market-dominant in every market that we operate. We expect to open 70 to 80 new company-owned stores for 2009 and a slightly lesser amount for franchised stores, and this doesn't include the franchised store conversions. We continue to look at conversion opportunities of existing competitive rental operators as prospective new franchisees or acquisition candidates. Our franchise program continues to gather steam as we had a net gain of 19 stores for the quarter and our franchise arena moving, it's at 562 stores and our pipeline of new stores to open in the future actually increased from 280 to 285 stores. Additionally, we continue to see price deflation, as Robin alluded to. We're also seeing it in our real estate as our leases are coming up for renewals. We continue to save 5% to 15% below the previous lease in most cases. Additionally, we see the price segregation in many of the products we placed in our stores that ultimately, will result in lower prices for our consumer. The order price of our proposition always results in increasing our customer base. That being said, we've created somewhat of a vacuum in our TV lineup, thus creating demand for the smaller 32-inch LCD TV and ultimately, hurt our 42-inch LCD TV business because of the significant price gap on our showroom floors. The 42-inch has been at the imported $99 price point for a while and we could've dropped the price but we couldn't fill the $99 price point for the larger model without actually cutting margins. Due to price segregation, we will now offer several models at that $99 price point that are larger than the 42-inch. It should help bridge that gap between the 32-inch price and the 42-inch price. This all will begin next week when our November gift guide lands in our stores and in the homes of our consumer. We look forward to continue producing great operating results this quarter as well. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President I'll go over some of the highlights for the quarter from a financial perspective. The company revenues increased 7% for the quarter, $415.3 million and 10% for the nine months to $1.3 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues for the third quarter and first nine months. They're up 12% in the quarter and 14% for the first nine months. Nine months revenues is $552.5 million. Revenues of franchisees are not, however, revenues of Aaron's Inc. As Ken said, our same-store revenues were 6.3% of growth in the third quarter. It was 4.5% for stores over two years old. Just looking for stores that are over five years old, and again, about half our stores are under five years old but for the stores over five years old, the same-store revenue growth compared to last year was 2.8%. And the same-store revenue growth for our franchised stores was 7.8% for this quarter compared to the quarter a year ago. Overall, revenue in the quarter was slightly less than we had projected primarily due to the lower than historical levels of recorded non-retail sales. Even though the dollar amount of the non-retail sales were down 2% for the quarter, the actual units that we shipped from our fulfillment centers were up 8%. This difference, as it was in the second quarter, is mainly due to declining costs of electronic products that we are currently offering. Net earnings from continuing operations were up 24% for the quarter to 24.7 million and net earnings from continuing operations for the nine months were $87.8 million, a 36% increase over the same period a year ago. A couple of things happened in the quarter that don't happen every quarter. In the third quarter, we did record, and as an operating expenses, a $2.2 million pretax charge to operating expenses relating to the write down of certain leased merchandise and the impairment of some longer-term assets associated with our Aaron's Office Furniture stores. As we noted in the press release, the Office Furniture stores are down substantially in revenues and up in losses from a year ago and so we're looking at those stores. We're down about 14 stores. We're making some plans to improve the performance in future periods. Also during the quarter, our tax provision was favorably impacted by a $2.3 million reversal of some previously recorded liabilities for uncertain income tax positions that were recorded under FIN 48 when we started accounting for it under FIN 48. Third quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.45 compared to $0.37 last year, up 22%. And for the nine months, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.61, a 34% increase over $1.20 last year. Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, the company has awarded area of development agreements to open 47 and 131 additional franchised stores and at the end of September 2009, we had 285 franchised stores that had been awarded, that are expected to open over the next several years. At September 30, we had open 1,059 company-operated Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 552 franchised stores, 13 company-operated RIMCO stores, seven franchised RIMCO stores and 14 Aaron's Office Furniture stores for a total of 1,655 stores open. As you saw in the press release, we had cash on hand at the end of September of $88.1 million. We're still benefiting from cash being generated from operations and the federal income tax benefits we've got in the last several years and our bonus depreciation. Through the first nine months of '09, we have generated approximately $150 million in cash flow from operations. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of '09, is we expect revenue of approximately $430 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.41 to $0.46 and our revenue guidance for '09 to be approximately $1.74 billion. We changed our earnings expectations for the year. Previously, our guidance for the '09 year was $1.95 to $2.05 for the year and our new guidance is $2.01 to $2.06. And as we've done for a number of years, we have an initial earnings guidance for 2010 and it's to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.15 to $2.35. We anticipate this year, as we've been saying all year, between 5% and 9% new store growth. It looks like it's probably going to come in a range of between 7% and 8% for '09 and for '10, again looking at 5% to 9% new store growth, pretty much an equal mix between company-operated and franchised stores. Those are the highlights of the quarter. We'll certainly turn the call over to any questions that we may have."
107,GV_001076_2010Q3,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Aaron's, Inc. Third Quarter 2010 Conference Call. At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gilbert Danielson with Aaron's, Inc. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you for joining us all again this quarter for our third quarter of the year. As usual, I'm going to turn it over to Lee Wilder to read our standard Safe Harbor statement and then we'll begin the conference call. Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist the Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K is available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today is Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments and then Gil will add some further information. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Thank you, Lee. Obviously, we are pleased with our third quarter results which were in line with our expectations. The Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership business continues to grow in revenues and customers. In the quarter, our company operates stores at same-store revenue growth of 3.2% and customer growth of 6.7%. In addition, although not revenues of Aaron's Inc., our franchised stores experienced a 4.5% growth in same-store revenues and an 8.7% increase in same-store customer growth. The total of our corporate franchise customers were up 12% over the same period of last year. These growth percentages are again excellent especially in these trying economic conditions. We believe that the current economic environment will continue to guide customers to our sales and lease ownership concept. We are doing well and have done so far well a couple of years even in some of the highest unemployment markets in the country. When the economy picks up and the employment picture improves, all the while credit remaining tight, we feel that our sales in the associate business will be in an even better position to satisfy our customers' needs. During the third quarter, we reviewed our corporate and operations process in staffing to make personnel modification in certain areas. This is a healthy exercise for the company, and we will continue to look for ways in the near future to improve efficiencies in all aspects of our business. We plan to continue to reallocate resources as necessary to improve overall performance. Manufacturing, shipment in dollars were up 16% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. We were up 4% for the nine months. Upholstery revenue was up 15% in the third quarter and bedding products were up a healthy 25% and units shipped were up substantially higher than dollars, the result of lower production costs through lower raw material costs and efficiencies including personnel. We feel our Woodhaven branded manufacturing plants gives us a distinct advantage over competitors. The Office Furniture division continues to be wound down as we have previously discussed. We closed two stores during the quarter and have only two stores remaining open. These remaining two stores will remain open through 2011 to liquidate discontinued merchandise. Our plans for 2010 are now to increase store count by approximately 7% to 9% over a number of stores opened at the end of 2009. In closing, I'd like to thank all of our Aaron's associates and franchise partners for another outstanding quarter. Thank you for your support of the company, and I'll now turn the call over to Ken for few comments before turning to Charlie. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Well, good evening, and thank you for your continued interest in Aaron's. Once again, we're very pleased with our operating results and the performances and efforts of more than 11,000 company associates and more than 5,000 franchise associates across the USA and Canada. Our business for this historically challenging quarter was strong as we gained an additional 25,000 new customers for the quarter representing a 12% increase in customer account over 2009. We had the most active quarter of the year in new store openings with 29 new company stores opened and 18 new franchised stores. We expect fourth quarter to be just as active. We did close 10 underperforming stores during the quarter, and we will continue to evaluate all stores not performing to minimum operating standards. As we have grown at a record-setting pace in last few years and now are normalized to a 7% to 9% new store opening program, we have challenged all of our home office and field support staff to look for ways to become more efficient by reducing costs of overtime payroll and best practices as Robin alluded to. Consequently, we have reduced these staffs by 45 associates. At the store level, we will look for more ways to operate more efficiently and reduce expenses through our going green initiative. As a result of our successful marketing campaigns along with the current market conditions of credit belt-tightening in the retail sector, our store traffic has been an all-time high, and we are focusing more on our overall sales effort at the store level and how to capture an even larger share of the market by more sales training and sales initiatives. We are extremely optimistic about the current direction we're pointed, but even more about where we're headed as Aaron's is marching quickly to become the largest operator in the Sales & Lease Ownership business. With the combined Aaron's company and franchised store revenues of $3 billion in 2011, that should put us in the top slight. Charlie? Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, I think you all have covered just about everything. I just want to thank all of the associates for what they are doing daily. We're making a lot of progress, we're moving forward and we have new programs that were rolling out. And we're very, very optimistic about the business and where we're going. And Ken said, we've set a goal of total revenue of $2 million, $11.1 million [sic] [billion] for the franchise. That's a very high goal, but we think we make it. We had a big meeting last week, and we've agreed that we can make this go. So thank you for everybody really giving it all for this company. Thank you. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President I'll go through some of the highlights for the third quarter. Company revenues increased 9% for the quarter to $452.2 million and 7% for the nine months to $1.392 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues to $204.4 million for the third quarter, a 10% increase over the same period last year and a $625.8 million for the nine months, an 11% increase. Revenues of franchisees are not, however, revenues of Aarons, Inc. As we mentioned, same-store revenue growth in the third quarter for company-operated stores was 3.2% and 1.6% for stores that are open over two years old. For the stores that were open over five years old, same-store revenue growth was up 0.3%. The same-store revenue growth for our franchised stores was 4.5%. The company had 872,000 company-operated store customers and 477,000 franchised stores, a 12% increase in total customers for the number at the end of the third quarter of 2009. Again as we mentioned, the customer count on a same-store basis was up 6.7% in the third quarter. Net earnings for the quarter were $26.2 million versus $24.6 million in 2009. Net earnings for the nine months were $87.6 million versus $87.5 million last year. EPS for the quarter was $0.32 compared to $0.30 last year on a fully diluted basis and for the nine months, the diluted earnings per share was $1.07 in both periods. As previously announced, we announced it in the second quarter of this year, on our last conference call last earnings release, we have begun ceasing the operations of the Aaron's Office Furniture division. During the third quarter, we closed two Aaron's Office Furniture stores, and we do have two remaining open, as which Robin said are basically open to continue to liquidate Office Furniture and they'll continue to be open into some period of 2011. Our third quarter financial results include pretax charges to operating expenses of $949,000 related to the closure of the division and the nine months’ results from pretax operating expenses of $8.1 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to the closure. The revenues for the Office Furniture stores, I don't want to spend too much time on them, but just to keep everything in perspective, the revenues for the Office Furniture stores were $2.5 million and $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Aaron's Office Furniture division reported a pretax loss of $993,000 in the third quarter and a $3.7 million loss in the third quarter of '09. For the first nine months of '10, revenues of the Aaron's Office Furniture stores were $10 million compared to $12.3 million for the same period of '09 and pretax losses were $11.1 million in 2010 versus $6.5 million in 2009. Included in the third quarter year-to-date losses are the above-mentioned charges that we previously mentioned. The company's other revenues in the third quarter included $1.2 million of store asset sales and the same amount was $193,000 in 2009 and for the nine months, there were $1.6 million of gains on store sales in 2010 and $6.3 million in 2009. During the third quarter of – the most recent third quarter, we opened 29 new company-operated stores and 18 new franchised stores. We also acquired four franchised stores and the accounts of three independent operators. We sold six company operated stores to several of our franchisees and one company-operated store to an unaffiliated operator and one RIMCO store left the franchise system. Eight company-operated stores and two Office stores were closed in the third quarter. The new store drag in the third quarter was approximately $0.04 per share. Through the three months and nine months ended September 30, we have awarded area development agreements to open 25 and 67 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of September, there were 266 franchised stores awarded that are expected to be opened over the next several years. At the end of September, Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership had 1,116 company-operated stores, 631 franchised stores, 12 company-operated RIMCO stores, and six franchised RIMCO stores. Again, the company had the two Office Furniture stores so our total number of stores at the end September was 1,767. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of this year 2010 is expected revenues of approximately $470 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.32 to $0.36 per share. Our revenue guidance for 2010 is to reach approximately $1.86 billion in revenue, and our guidance for the year for 2010 is to record diluted earnings per share in a range of $1.39 to $1.43. And that does include that estimated $0.06 per diluted share cost that's associated with closing the Office Furniture division. As we do or we have done for a number of years in the third quarter, we do put out some earnings guidance for next year, this will be 2011. And our guidance for 2011 is to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.54 to $1.70 per share. We anticipate a net new store growth of 5% to 9% in 2011. That's pretty much the highlights. We'll certainly open up the call for any questions that anybody may have."
108,GV_001076_2011Q3,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Third Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host, Gil Danielson, CFO of Aaron's Inc. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you for joining us this afternoon. The operator is going to read our standard Safe Harbor statement before we get started, and then we'll have a few comments. And then after that, we'll have some questions and answers. So Monique, could you read that? Operator Yes, sir. The company's earnings release issued today and related form 8-K are available on our website,in the Investors Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today is Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from those such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, and the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings and store acquisitions and disposition activity for the future periods. I would now like to pass the conference back over to Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you very much. Robin, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments, and then I'll add some further information. So Rob? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Well, thank you very much, Gil. I appreciate everybody joining the call. We've had our release earlier, and we once again recorded strong revenue growth. This quarter with same store revenues up 5.3% and customer counts up 6.3% for the third quarter of this last year. In addition, although not revenues of Aaron's Inc, our franchised stores experienced a 3.1% growth in same store revenues and a 3.2% increases in same store customer growth. The total of our corporate and franchise customers were up 9.8% over the same period a year ago. As noted in our earnings, we believe -- in earnings release -- excuse me, I'm sorry. As noted in the earnings release, even though these gains are outstanding in the current economic conditions, we believe our customers continue to feel the strain of high unemployment and overall economic pressures. Our recession-resilient business model has done well from an economic cycles, and our large customer base needs a non-credit way to obtain basic home furnishings, and even more so in the current tight credit environment. We have again proved that with proper execution, our business can do very well in difficult economic conditions. Our pretax margins were negatively affected this quarter due to the higher depreciation expense of leased merchandise, the cost of rapidly converting over 40 third-party stores acquired to the -- and converted to HomeSmart store concept, along with some other increased operating costs due to some positive operational changes we are implementing for the future growth and development of the company. We are quite excited about the experimental HomeSmart weekly pay concept and are cautiously ramping up the number of stores. Our current plan is to have approximately 65 HomeSmart stores open by year end, then slow down any further opening until we can fully evaluate the stores' financial performance and returns. Excluding a lawsuit related charge discussed earlier in the second quarter, net earnings for the 9 months of 2011 would have been $105.8 million. And earnings per share, assuming dilution, excluding the lawsuit- related charges, would have been $1.32, a 23% increase over the 9 months of last year. Also of note, during the third quarter, the company received $125 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in a private placement. These funds have and will be used for general corporate purposes and for the repurchase of company stock. We have purchased a substantial number of shares of stock during the quarter. On October 14, the company closed on its previously announced GBP 10 billion investment in Perfect Home Holdings Limited, a U.K. rent-to-own company. We feel this investment of an 11.5% ownership in the company will give us a good exposure to the U.K. market and could be a springboard for possible European and international expansion. We are quite impressed with the PerfectHome management team and owners and feel that our partnership will be mutually beneficial in the years to come. Our Woodhaven manufacturing plants had a slight decrease in production in dollars of 2% in the quarter but had an increase in production in dollars of 17% for the year-to-date, a reflection of the increasing demand of Aaron's stores for our furniture and bedding products. Woodhaven is on track at a record year in shipments. Thanks to you for the support of the company, and now I'll turn to Ken -- the call over to Ken for a couple of comments. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Thank you, Robin. This past quarter has been one of the most active quarters that I can recall in terms of buying and selling, closing, merging and moving stores as well as our back office support system. First of all, we moved our Atlanta Fulfillment Center to a better physical facility and geographic location, and this enabled us to move our administrative services into the same location. They and our last office liquidation store were in a location at I-85 and I-285, better known as Spaghetti Junction here in Atlanta, that many of you may have seen over the last 40 years. We closed down that facility, moved the last remaining office liquidation location into the old Fulfillment Center in Duluth. And when this happened, we were able to move the administrative center out of that facility in Northeast and into the new Fulfillment Center. In an even bigger move, we combined our Winston Salem and Columbia, South Carolina Fulfillment Centers into 1 location that's operating in Charlotte, North Carolina. Additionally, we combined several departments in home office to create our new Associate Relations Department. All these moves were designed and executed so that we can do a better and more efficient job in supporting our associates in stores. Right after the end of the quarter, as Robin alluded to, we made our 11.5% investment in the PerfectHome stores in the U.K., and we look to exchange ideas and business practices to help both operations in the future. And it's going to give us an opportunity to own, operate and franchise stores in the European landscape. With our core Aaron's model, we opened 24 new locations, closed approximately 20 underperforming stores, purchased the accounts from various competitors to enhance the customer base, revenue and profitability of 27 existing locations. Additionally, there were 4 franchised stores sold from franchisee to franchisee. We also opened up one RIMCO store, and we're seeing very positive results coming out in that division. Our new HomeSmart concept is picking up momentum as we opened 4 new stores and acquired and then successfully converted 37 new locations, bringing our total to 56 stores opened at the end of the quarter. These acquisitions were opportunistic-driven, and they weren't projected to be in our store count. And we already have another group of new stores in the queue to be opened in the fourth quarter, which should bring us somewhere in the neighborhood of 70 stores by year end. We continue to closely monitor the results of these stores as well as the results of the nearest Aaron's locations. I made it a point to visit the vast majority of these stores and spent time with our HomeSmart and Aaron's associates at ground level, and they say no crossover account cannibalization. I get a report daily to match up the results as well and see no sign of it here as well. Although it is still early to be conclusive in the model, one thing we know for sure is that business is brisk in both stores, the Aaron's and the HomeSmart. Because of this rapid growth, we're going to slow down the opening of the new stores in HomeSmart for a short time as we continue to develop the model, or from the infrastructure, as evidenced by our recent move of appointing longtime associate, Mark Rudnick, to VP of Marketing over HomeSmart and RIMCO. And as soon as this process is complete, I see a major acceleration of growth to the brand through company and franchise acquisition -- expansion rather. I said acquisition. Our core overall Aaron's business remains solid, as evidenced that revenues continued to climb to 5.3% on a same store basis for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 961,000 corporate active customers and 520,000 franchise customers, which represents an increase of 9.8%. In summary, we're making strategic moves to not only help our operations in the short term but also position us to grow and prosper in the years to come. So Charlie? Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Yes, thank you, Ken. I just want to thank our 11,000 employees for their hard work for the last quarter and last year. We're on track to continue to grow big time. I see it from my desk. I see a lot of future growth. And I'm very enthused over the HomeSmart concept. Everything I see about that seems to be good. I really don't see any negative right today, and I guess that's my job now, is to see positives and negatives. And I'm very enthusiastic about where we're going. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Charlie. I'll give the highlights for the third quarter and the 9-month period. Company revenues increased 7% for the quarter to $485.2 million and 8% for the 9 months to $1.5 billion in revenues. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues to $223.9 million for the quarter. So a 10% increase over the same period last year. And our revenues were up 9% for the 9 months at just under $700 million. Revenues of franchisees are not, however, revenues of Aaron's Inc. Same store revenue was good in the third quarter for our company-operated stores. It was up 5.3%. And it was up 3.8% for our stores opened over 2 years old. For stores that were open over 5 years old at the end of the third quarter, it was up 1.6% over the same period a year ago. The same store revenue growth for the franchised stores was 3.1%. Once again, and we're seeing in the company stores same store revenues in the third quarter were positive in all parts of the country. As Ken mentioned, we had 961,000 company-operated store customers at the end of September, and 520 million (sic) [520,000] franchised stores (sic) [customers], an increase of 9.8%. We're now just a shade under 1.5 million customers in the Aaron's system. I suspect that we will go above 1.5 million at the end of the next quarter. As we mentioned, the customer count on a same store basis for company- operated stores was up 6.3%, and for franchised stores, it was up 3.2% for the third quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. Again, the revenues and customers of franchisees are not the revenues of the company. Net earnings for the quarter were up 7%, $28 million, versus $26.2 million in the same period of last year. And net earnings for the 9 months were $83.2 million versus $87.6 million last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.36 compared to $0.32 last year. And for the 9 months, the earnings per share is $1.04 for 2011 and $1.07 for 2010. As you'll recall, in the second quarter, we had a charge a lawsuit expense of $36.5 million, which recess [ph] from a judgment we had in the second quarter. Excluding that charge, net earnings for the 9 months would have been $105.8 million, and diluted earnings per share $1.32. It'll be a $0.20 -- 23% increase over the 9 months of last year. The dollar amount of our low-margin retail sales -- non-retail sales, excuse me, which are the sales of new product to our franchisees, were up 2% for the quarter. However, the actual number shipped from our Fulfillment Centers increased 12%. We had a lot of new store movement, as we talked about in the press release. A lot of opening HomeSmart stores and closing some stores and buying some accounts. And so we realized [ph] the full quarter for us from that regard. Talk about new store drag, new store drag for the Aaron's store for the quarter was approximately $0.03 per diluted share and -- this year, in this quarter. It was $0.04 last year in 2010. The new store drag on the HomeSmart stores, which we rapidly ramped up this quarter, was approximately $0.03 per diluted share in the third quarter of this year. But we didn't have any HomeSmart stores open at the same period last year. Margins were affected in the third quarter as a result of an increase in the lower-margin early payment -- payouts of agreements. Our early payouts went up substantially in the third quarter of this year versus the same period of last year. But it's a lower-margin transaction, so that we see the increased depreciation expense of leased merchandise in the quarter. And that's a reflection of that, and that's primarily the reason that we didn't have some product mix [ph], too, which drove the depreciation expense up a little bit. For 3 and 9 months ended September 30 of the year, we -- the company has awarded area development agreements to open 7 and 51 additional franchised stores. And at the end of September 2011, there were 247 franchised stores awarded that we expect will be opened over the next several years. At September 30 of this year, the Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,135 company-operated stores, 693 franchised stores, 13 company-operated RIMCO stores, 56 HomeSmart stores and 6 franchised RIMCO stores. We also had the one Aaron's Office Furniture store open. So our total store count at the end of September was 1,904 stores. We did have quite a bit of cash on hand again at the end of September at $219 million of cash on hand. And as we previously mentioned here, that we did close on our private placement in July that brought in $125 million of cash for the company on a long-term debt. These funds that we brought in, in July will be used for general corporate purposes and has been and will be for the repurchase from -- used from time to time for repurchase of company stock. We did mention we did make the investment in PerfectHome in October, as we talked about. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of this year is that revenues of approximately $520 million and diluted earnings per share in a range of $0.41 to $0.45 per share. Our revenue guidance for 2011 is to reach approximately $2 billion, a little bit more than $2 billion in revenues. And the earnings guidance in the range of $1.73 to $1.77 is a non-GAAP number and is updated a little bit from previous guidance. The fiscal year guidance excludes the second quarter $0.28 per share, diluted share charge from the lawsuit. As we historically have done, we have made an initial earnings guidance for the following year, for 2012, and have achieved earnings per share in the range of $1.88 to $2.04 per share. We now anticipate our new store growth of between 6% and 8% for 2011 and expect overall new store growth in 2012 to be in the range of 5% to 9%, which has been our goal and guidance for the last several years on new store growth. We did buy some shares back during the quarter. During the third quarter, we acquired 3.6 million shares of our common stock for about $87 million -- $89.7 million. And during the first 9 months of this year, we have acquired just over 5 million shares of company stock at a cost of about $127 million. We currently have board authorization to purchase an additional almost 5.3 million shares. We generated around $94 million in cash flow from operations in the third quarter and $296 million for the first 9 months of 2011. Just looking at the store-level gross revenue, the write-off of gross revenues, they were 3.3% in the third quarter of 2011, a little bit higher than -- which was typical in the summer months a year ago in the third quarter. The percentage -- write-offs as a percentage of gross revenues were 3.4%. So slightly better than a year ago. Those are the prepared comments. We'll certainly take any questions, if there may be."
109,GV_001076_2012Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gil Danielson, with Aaron's. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you all, for joining us this morning. As usual, I'm going to turn the call over to Lee Wilder, who works in Investor Relations for us, and she will read our Safe Harbor statement. And then Ron and Ken will have some comments, and I'll follow up at the end. So, Lee? Lee Wilder Good morning. My name is Lee Wilder and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,in the Investor Relations section. This webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today is Ron Allen, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings and store acquisitions and disposition activities for future periods. Ron and Ken will have a few comments, and then Gil will add further information followed by a Q&A. Ron? Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you, Lee, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to once again report another outstanding quarter for Aaron's. Through the first 9 months of the year, we've met our business goals and objectives and we expect 2012 to be another record year for the company in both revenues and earnings. As many of you know, Aaron's financial performance has been remarkably consistent through the years in all types of economic conditions. As we've noted before, we believe the current tight credit environment for customers actually has been a positive for our business. And of course, high unemployment levels are a negative. We believe these current economic conditions will continue to the foreseeable future. However, as conditions improve, Aaron's should continue to perform well as we've done in the past. Our customers desire, and need, high-quality basic home furnishings to go about their daily lives, and usually cannot readily get this merchandise at traditional retailers due to credit constraints. However, they can obtain these products at Aaron's with our flexible payment plans and superior personalized service. Aaron's experienced management team knows our business and they know our customers, and we believe our folks perform at an exceptional level. We are confident that we will meet our 2012 new store opening plans and also continue to see a substantial growth ahead for our existing, and new, Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. We anticipate opening about the same number of Aaron's stores in 2013 as we do in 2012. Now the HomeSmart stores continue to ramp up in revenues and we are optimistic about this weekly pay concept, but we still have some work to do in perfecting the business model, and currently anticipate not opening any significant number of new stores until at least the last half of 2013. On September 28, we celebrated the opening of our 2,000th store, which is located in the Bronx, New York. The Bronx and the other boroughs in New York are areas where we have historically had very little presence, and that gives us plenty of more opportunity to open stores there. Now as I complete my first year as CEO, I'm very proud of all the associates and their accomplishments during this 12-month period. Not only has our financial performance of the company met expectations, we have put in place many strategic and tactical initiatives to improve our infrastructure. We've greatly enhanced our associate resource functions focusing on management development, retention and organization. We've put in crispness [ph] just on long-term planning, invested in information technology and have other initiatives in process that will result in great value to the company, now and in future years, as this business continues to grow and to expand. I've been extremely impressed with the ability of our Aaron's management team and our dedicated associates. Let me close by reflecting on the fact that our Founder and Chairman, Charlie Loudermilk, retired in the middle of September. I visited with Charlie just last week here, and he told me, he said, ""Ron, I've really let go."" And I said, ""Well, Charlie, that's great. Because now you can sit back and look at the company that you've created and be very proud of."" But I said, ""More importantly, I want you to look back in 2 years and feel very good and be very proud of what we've done, as we build the company that you started."" We'll all miss Charlie, believe me, but we wish him well in his well deserved retirement. Again, I thank you for your support and the interest in our company. And I'll now turn the call over to Ken Butler who will talk more about some of the results of the quarter. And at the conclusion of Gil's comments, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Ken? William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. As our results indicate, the business climate in our stores is strong, even coming out of the most difficult quarter of the year. Same-store revenues are now at 6.5% and our customer count, on a same-store basis, is at 8.2% for the quarter. Our total customer base has grown 12% over the same period 1 year ago. We had several highlights for the quarter, as Ron mentioned, the opening of our 2,000th store in the Bronx. This was a huge testimony to years of hard work and dedication from all of our associates and franchisees who have been a part of our great company. We also successfully converted our first store to our new computer system and we'll begin expanding to convert more stores in the fourth quarter. This new system is replacing our legacy system that has been in place since the early days of Aaron's. If you can go back to technology in that day, the difference between the new system and the old is like comparing an Atari game system to the new Xbox. Our operators literally are all positioning themselves to be first in line for the conversion. During the quarter, we opened 14 new company-operated stores and also opened 13 new franchised stores. We acquired 4 franchised stores back, and we've sold 2 stores back to franchisees. We also sold off the remaining assets of our legacy Aaron's Office Furniture business to a third-party. Our new HomeSmart model continues to mature and grow, and we will continue to work on perfecting the model and building a strong management foundation to prepare for the future. The last highlight of the quarter was the retirement of Charlie Loudermilk, as Ron mentioned. We are all committed to keep the culture and value system in place that Charlie instilled in us for so many years, and to carry forward that legacy as we march into the near future with our eyes set on becoming the largest rental operator in the United States. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Ken. I'll briefly go over the highlights -- the financial highlights -- of the third quarter. Company revenues increased 9% for the quarter to $529.5 million and 10% for the 9 months to over $1.6 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues, $232 million for the third quarter, a 3% increase over the same period last year. And their revenues are up 7% for the 9 months compared to 1 year ago to $733.6 million. Revenues of franchisees are not, of course, however, revenues of Aaron's, Inc. As we mentioned, same-store revenue growth in the third quarter of our company-operated stores was 6.5%, and 4.8% for the stores that had opened over 2 years during the quarter. For stores opened over 5 years old, it was up 3.7%, which is quite strong, we felt. The same-store revenue growth for the franchised stores was up 3.2% for the third quarter. The company had 1,090,000 company-operated store customers and 572,000 franchised customers at the end of the third quarter which was an increase of over 12% in total customers compared to the same period in the third quarter of 2011. The customer count on a same-store basis for company-operated stores was up 8.2% in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Our GAAP net earnings for the quarter were up 3% to $28.9 million versus $28 million in 2011, and GAAP net earnings for the 9 months were $136.4 million versus $83.2 million. As you know, we had a couple -- we had a large reversal of charge in the first quarter this year, and in the third quarter, we had it -- the charge based for Charlie's retirement. So both those charges had some swings that affected our net earnings for the quarter and for the 9 months. For the third quarter, our GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.38 compared to $0.36 last year, and for the 9 months, diluted earnings per share were $1.77 for 2012 and $1.4 for 2011. Just going through the quarter, during the first quarter, as I mentioned, the company recorded a $35.5 million into income or $0.28 per diluted share for a reversal of accrued lawsuit expense that we had recorded in the second quarter of 2011. And then during the third quarter of this year, we recorded $10.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share charged to earnings for costs associated with Charlie's retirement. Excluding the lawsuit-related reversals and the retirement charge this quarter, net earnings for the third quarter would have been $35.4 million compared to $28 million in 2011, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.46 this year -- this quarter into '12 versus $0.36 in '11. So the non-net GAAP of EPS is up 28% over the quarter last year. For the 9 months, net earnings, again on a non-GAAP basis, would have been $120.8 million compared to $105.8 million last year. EPS would be $1.57 versus $1.32 last year, and that is a 9% increase. The revenue to the HomeSmart division were $14.2 million during the quarter, and compared to $5.7 last year when the division was just starting up. And then for the 9 months, revenues of the HomeSmart division were $40.4 million compared to $6.7 million for the same period, for the 9 months of 2011. As we have noted, we have -- I guess, we have 1 more HomeSmart store that's going to open by the end of the year. But we don't really plan to open any significant number of HomeSmart stores, maybe 1 or 2, plus or minus, but nothing significant until the latter half of 2013 to give us some more time to work on the business model. During the third quarter of 2012, we opened 14 company-operated stores and 13 franchised stores. We also acquired 4 franchised stores, and the accounts of 3 third-party stores, which are added to Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores. In addition, the accounts of 2 third-party stores were acquired and transferred to the HomeSmart, and we've sold 2 company-operated stores to franchisees. And as Ken mentioned, we sold the last remaining Aaron's Office Furniture store to a third-party. And we did -- and also finally, we closed 2 company-operated stores during the quarter. At the end of September 30, 2012, we had 1,190 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 717 Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership franchised stores, 78 HomeSmart stores, 1 franchised HomeSmart store, 17 company-operated rental stores and 6 franchised rental stores for a grand total of stores opened at the end of September of 2,009 stores. The franchisee's activity during the month, we did award 7 more area developments to the new franchisees -- or existing franchisees in the quarter. And we have added 36 award -- 36 more area development agreements during the 9 months. And at the end of September, we had 201 stores, franchised stores, that people have put money down, that will -- or planned to open over the next 2 or 3 years. As we noted in the earnings release, our guidance for the fourth quarter of this year, 2012, is to expect revenues of approximately $575 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.48 to $0.52 per share. Revenues for the year 2012 are again expected to be over $2.2 billion. Our GAAP fiscal year diluted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.29. The non-GAAP fiscal year diluted earnings per share, excluding the 2 extraordinary items, should be in the range or expected to be in the range of $2.05 and $2.09. And again, as we have done for a number of years, in the third quarter, we have put in an initial earnings guidance for the next year, this being fiscal year 2013. And our guidance for the -- our initial guidance is to achieve earnings per share in the range of $2.25 to $2.41 per share. We did buy a -- repurchased some stock back during the quarter of 873,000 shares. And we've done 1.2 million shares for the 9 months. The dollar amount that we paid in the third quarter for the shares of stocks were -- was $24.6 million, and for the 9 months, $34.1 million. Those are our comments. We will certainly answer any questions that people may have."
110,GV_001076_2013Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Aaron's, Inc. Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gil Danielson with Aaron's, Inc. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. With me today is Ron Allen, our CEO, and Dave Buck, Chief Operating Officer. Before we get started, I'm going to turn it over to Garet Hayes, who works for Aaron's, and she's going to read our standard Safe Harbor statement and then Ron will have some comments and Dave and then I'll follow up with some -- with the financial information. So Garet? Garet Hayes The company's earnings release issued last night and the related Form 8-K are available on the company's website, in the Investor Relations section and this website (sic) [webcast] will be archived for replay there as well. Before the results are discussed, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and regulatory investigations and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation, Aaron's projected revenues, earnings and store openings for future periods and other statements under the heading Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Outlook. Statements regarding planned share repurchases and statements regarding legal and regulatory accruals for loss contingencies. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Allen, Ron will have a few comments, and Dave and Gil will add some further information. Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you, Garet, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and I thank you again for joining us today. As we advised you in our October 4 release, we are certainly disappointed with the quarter's results. Our same-store revenue and customer growth in the company-operated stores were basically flat for the quarter and shipments to our franchisees were below the same period last year. While traffic does remain good in most of our stores, we did have a higher percentage of write-offs in this quarter which indicates that our customers continue to struggle in this current economic environment. We've initiated some new promotions in the past several weeks and we feel that these will generate more customers and revenue growth during this quarter and into 2014. Gil will discuss the financial results in more detail, but I would like to reflect on the year-to-date and our confidence in the future. We continue to have strong faith in our business model. This confidence is certainly reinforced by our Board of Directors' recent authorization to purchase up to a total of 15 million of our common shares and we will begin this program at the very near future. And as I reflect on the past 9 months, it truly has been a rebuilding year for the company. It's a year that has had many distractions, along with significant management changes. These distractions include various legal and regulatory matters. However, we've made substantial progress in all of these areas of concern. You probably have seen an article covering a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over security and privacy issues. I'm pleased that we were able to reach this agreement with no financial penalty to the company. We also have made substantial progress in our discussions with the Office of the California Attorney General. As you know, we have accrued an additional $13.4 million for this investigation this quarter and we continue to cooperate in these discussions and we do not feel additional accruals will be necessary. Our management team continues to be strengthened. We're adding new leadership in the training and the development of our associates. And during the quarter, we added talent to our marketing and to our legal teams to provide support for the growth of our operations. But most importantly, Dave Buck, our Chief Operating Officer, continues to build and enhance our operating team with the addition of experienced -- and Aaron's management, including Neil Salvador, our Director of Sales; Wayne Hopper, Director of Operations and Analytics; and Justin Hafer, Director of Customer Accounts Management. These 3 individuals have a total of 35 years experience with Aaron's. And I'm particularly proud of Tristan Montanero and the team he's building in our HomeSmart division. He's perfecting the model, refining the product line and the infrastructure for pricing flexibility, which is needed to solidify this growth platform for our company. Finally, our new point-of-sale system is employed in now some almost 750 stores and certainly will be a boost to our efficiency in serving our customers and providing valuable information about our sales and marketing efforts. In summary, while this has been a challenging year for our company, I'm very optimistic about our future as we continue to resolve these regulatory and legal issues and build on a platform of strength and infrastructure and, most importantly, a solid management team and our dedicated and professional associates. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Buck, our Chief Operating Officer. Dave? David L. Buck Former Chief Operating Officer Ron, thank you very much. As Ron said, we're not very happy with our -- this quarter's results. That being said, I just had a great 3-day meeting with our divisional vice presidents and my staff, and we are totally focused on getting back to the basics, which in this industry means renting and collecting. I think all of our distractions from the past year are behind us, I'm looking forward to the fourth quarter and 2014. As indicated in the earnings release, the franchised stores had better results, and that tells us that the customer opportunities are there. We are all in agreement. I'm very proud of my divisional staff, my divisional vice presidents, my new staff that I've put together to support them, and we will definitely make the most positive impact. Thank you. Ron, Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Dave. I'll go over some of the financial highlights of the third quarter. Company revenues increased 2% for the quarter to $539.5 million and 2% for the 9 months to $1,687,000,000. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues 6% in the quarter over the same period last year and 4% for the 9 months. The revenues of the franchisees for the 9 months were $763.3 million. As we know, the revenues of franchisees are not, however, revenues of Aaron's, Inc. Lease revenues and fees were up 3% for the third quarter compared to the same period last year and up 5% for the year compared to the same period in 2012. Non-retail sales, which are primarily sales of lease merchandise in Aaron's franchisees decreased 3% for the quarter and 12% for the year compared to the same period last year. On a same-store revenue growth for the company-operated stores, they were -- it was basically flat for the quarter. It was up 0.5% for stores over 15-months old and it was slightly down to 0.8% for 2-year old stores. For stores over 5-years old, the same-store revenue growth was down 1.5%. So certainly, our same-store revenue growth was disappointing in the quarter, much less than it has been in previous quarters through the years and is really just a reflection that revenue and customer growth has been weak in this quarter. But customer count on a same-store basis for company-operated stores was up 0.3% in the third quarter compared to the quarter last year, again much less than it has been in previous quarters through the years. However, same-store revenues for franchised stores were up 2.2% and customer count was up 2.5% for the quarter. I think that's certainly a positive sign that in the franchised stores are doing better both in revenue and customer growth than we are at the moment from a corporate standpoint. It certainly means they have the same customers that we have and in different spots of the country, but they are the same customers. And I think that's positive that customers are still out there and wanting our product and need our product, we just have to do a better job on the corporate side, I think, to execute and capture those products -- those customers. The company, at the end of September, had 1,114,000 of customers -- company-operated customers and 597,000 franchised customers, and that was a 3% increase at the end of the quarter over the same number at the end of the third percent -- third quarter in 2012. Net earnings for the quarter were down 27% to $21.1 million versus $28.9 million last year. These are our GAAP net earnings. Net earnings for the 9 months were down 28% to $98 million versus $136.4 million same period last year. And again, on the GAAP EPS, the GAAP EPS was $0.28 during the quarter compared to $0.38 last year and for the 9 months, $1.28 versus $1.77. As you all know, in the last couple of years, we've had 3 or 4 kind of special charges that have run through the income statement and we've presented the numbers on a non-GAAP basis. During the third quarter, we recorded a $13.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, additional accrual regulated -- related to the California regulatory investigation. We also had accrued $15 million for that proceeding in the second quarter. So the total amount accrued in 2013 for the California investigation is $28.4 million. It is ongoing and has not reached our final settlement yet, but we're quite confident that as far as the financial perspective and most of the work that, that's behind us in that regard and we don't expect to see any other further accruals regarding California in the future. In addition, as we've mentioned before, during the second quarter of 2013, we recorded $4.9 million of charges related to retirement spends and a change in our vacation policies. Last year, in the third quarter, we had a $10.4 million charge relating to retirement. And in the first quarter of 2012, we've actually had a credit of commercial entity [ph] income on the settlement of a lawsuit of $35.5 million. Excluding all that above, which I just said, diluted earnings per share for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis would have decreased to $0.40 per share from $0.46, a 13% decrease. And net earnings would've decreased to $30.8 million from $35.5 million, also down 13% over the same period in 2012. For the 9 months, diluted earning per shares for the 9 months in 2013 would have been $1.50, so that's versus $1.57 last year, basically flat, and net earnings would have slightly decreased about 1% down to $119.6 million. Revenues of HomeSmart during the quarter were $14.8 million, which is 5% over $14.2 million that we recorded last year in the third quarter. And then net revenues for the first 9 months for HomeSmart, $47.6 million versus $40.4 million. We did lose money, again, in HomeSmart, this quarter. Actually, we entered the quarter, we're planning to lose some money in the third quarter, but we've lost about $1 million more than planned to be around $1.6 million, really a reflection that the revenues have been flat or actually slightly declining in HomeSmart over the last year. So -- and we'll talk a little bit about HomeSmart and answer some questions on that a little bit later. During the third quarter of 2013, we opened -- the company opened 5 company-operated Aaron's stores, 8 franchised stores, 2 franchised HomeSmart stores and 1 RIMCO store. We also acquired 6 franchised stores and 2 -- and sold 2 stores to a franchisee during the quarter. We also closed a couple of company- operated stores and 1 franchised RIMCO store. So at the end of September, we had exactly 2,111 stores open and the combination of Aaron's stores -- company stores of 1,242, our franchised Aaron's stores of 760 stores open. We had the 78 HomeSmart stores. We did have the 3 franchised stores, we did add 2 franchised stores to the HomeSmart stores during the third quarter, 23 company-operated RIMCO stores and 5 franchised RIMCO stores. As far as awarding new area development agreements for our franchise operations during the 3 months, we opened -- we entered into 12 more agreements and will open 25 agreements -- entered into 25 agreements during the year of 2013. At the end of September 2013, area development agreements were outstanding for the opening of 167 franchised stores over the next several years. We did change our guidance. Our guidance for the fourth quarter here in 2013 is to expect revenues of approximately $575 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.38 to $0.42 per share. We slightly reduced our fiscal year revenue forecast to recording approximately $2.26 billion. GAAP EPS for the year, we now expect to be $1.67 to $1.71. And the non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year of $1.95 to $1.99. The EPS guidance does not assume any significant repurchases of the company stock. However, as we have mentioned, it is our intention -- we have not repurchased any shares this year. But it is our intention, moving forward now, to resume our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter here this year and beyond. And so, there will be some changes in EPS as we move forward. As far as guidance for 2014, what we're going to do a little bit differently, we're going to come out prior to the end of the year, we're going to talk about our guidance for 2014, both our revenue and our earnings guidance, and also, our outlook for HomeSmart, where we really see where we -- how many stores we're going to open in HomeSmart, as well as overall store count growth. I do believe, certainly, in 2014, our new store growth this year, we should have about 2,150 stores opened by the end of this year, which should be around a 4% store opening growth. We will talk about this later when we give the guidance for 2014. But I do expect the store opening growth for next year will be consistent with what it has been for last few years and probably around 4% to 5% growth [indiscernible] in 2014 over the number of -- that we'll have here at the end of the year. Those are pretty much the highlights, the financial highlights of the quarter, but we'll certainly answer any questions anybody may have."
111,GV_001076_2007Q4,"Presentation Operator Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Aaron Rents’ fourth quarter earnings call. At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. The company’s earnings release issued yesterday and the related Form 8-K is available on the Aaron Rents’ website at in the Investor Relations section and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today is Charlie Loudermilk, CEO; Robert Loudermilk, President; Ken Butler, President of Aaron Sales and Lease Ownership; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results I would like to read the company’s Safe Harbor statements. Except for the historical information the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company’s 2006 annual report on Form 10-K as updated by subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q including, without limitation, the company’s projected revenues, earnings and store openings for future periods. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Thank you for joining us this morning. Charlie will start the call with a few comments and then Ken will add some further comments and then I will come up at the end and kind of go over the financial highlights and then we’ll have questions and answers after that. So, Charlie. R. Charles Loudermilk I’m pleased with last year how it came out. We opened over 200 stores. In this business you have a big new store drag, we call it new store drag. Each store loses $150,000 to $200,000 before it turns into a black month and so we have digested that. Of course with that large an expansion you have things such as personnel problems and of course problems with inventory and all the other. So I’m very pleased with how the month came out. I think we’re positioned now to really do well this coming year or the year we’re in today. That’s all I might have to say. Ken. William K. (Ken) Butler Good morning. First of all I just want to thank and recognize all of our employees, franchisees, partners and suppliers for all the hard work and dedication that’s gone into our aggressive store opening plan over the last 18 months. Although some outsiders and investors have said the plan was ill fated and costly for sure, I am proud of the extra effort that has been put forth by our team to get the advanced majority of the stores opened successfully. As in college football recruiting or any professional sports draft, you cannot measure the success of [inaudible] after class until several years of performance of results. Although have been rightfully critical of the plan due to the loss of short term profitability, I truly believe we will all appreciate this accomplishment several years down the road. In fact I think it’s very similar to the [Holly Meyers] locations we acquired more than five years ago and the quantum leap that was made with our stock performance afterward. As we enter 2008 our plans are to slow down our new company store openings and allow our management team enough time to absorb the new store drag and focus on our mature operations from a profitability and personnel standpoint. We have around 35 parcels of land we have acquired in addition to the new stores we’re opening this year. Most of these are already permitted and ready to go when we begin a normalized rate of expansion in the not so distant future. Our franchise sales initiative continues to attract quality, well funded franchisees and we remain proud of what our franchised system has and continues to accomplish. Although our business climate has been challenging we have focused on what we can control and our associates have been working hard to reduce our write offs and increase revenue in each and every store. I’m happy to report to you that we are seeing a lot of progress in these areas. Our current business climate is upbeat as we are seeing an increasing demand for LCD TVs. We think this will continue on as in February of 2009 there will no longer be an analog signal submitted to your television set. What that means is if you currently have an analog TV, you’ll either have to get a converter box to change the signal to digital or purchase or lease a new digital television, hopefully from Aarons, because nobody beats Aarons. We take our current up tick we’re experiencing in our television line as evidence of the trend. Additionally we’ve changed some of our terms in our furniture pricing and we are seeing some immediate results of increasing demand in that category. All in all we are optimistic about our future and everyone on our team is focused on looking for ways to reduce costs, increase revenue and improve operating results. Gilbert L. Danielson I’ll just go over a few of the financial highlights for the quarter and 12 months. The revenue has increased 14% for the quarter and 13% for the year. The average sales on lease ownership revenues increased 16% for the fourth quarter and 14% for the year. In addition, our franchisees their revenues that are not revenues of Aaron Rents, they’re their own revenues, but they also increased their revenues 18% for the quarter and 15% for the year. Same store revenue growth for the fourth quarter for the Company- operated stores was 3.9%. Same store revenue growth for the franchised stores was 15%. Net earnings for the quarter were $15.5 million or $0.28 per diluted share and for the year was $80.3 million or $1.46 per diluted share. During the quarter we added a net 99 new Aaron stores and a net 215 stores for the year that’s 15% in store count. We also awarded area development agreements during the quarter to open another 30 franchised stores and our pipeline of stores that are expected to open in the future at the end of December was 284 stores. At December 31st we had 987 Company-operated sales and lease ownership stores; 480 franchised stores; 27 Company-operated RIMCO stores; 4 franchised RIMCO stores; and 62 corporate furnishing stores for a total of 1,550 stores open. As we noted in our earnings release we plan to open in 2008 between 55 and 75 new Company-operated stores and between 70 and 90 new franchised stores. The Company-operated store openings will be offset somewhat by the merging and selling of some stores not meeting our revenue and profit goals and as we have done in the past we also plan to continue to acquired franchised stores or sell Company-operated stores to franchisees as appropriate. We expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 2008 to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.43 per diluted share and for the 2008 year in the range of $1.40 to $1.55 per diluted share. Our plans for the next several years are to grow on average over the next several years our store base in the range of 10 to 13% a year. As we did mention our store growth will be a little less than that in 2008 as we do some re- shuffling of the stores that we currently have. We’ll certainly now turn the call open for any questions that people may have."
112,GV_001076_2008Q4,"Presentation Operator Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Aaron Rents fourth quarter earnings release conference call. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the call over to Mr. Gilbert Danielson. Mr. Danielson you may begin. Gilbert Danielson Well, thank you for joining us this morning. I’m going to turn the call over briefly to Leigh Wilder, who works with us in investor relations, and she’s going to make the introductions and read our Safe Harbor Statement and then we’ll have a few prepared remarks and then we’ll certainly answer any questions. Leigh Wilder Good morning. My name is Leigh Wilder and I assist in investor relations for Aaron Rents. The company’s earnings release issued yesterday, and the related Form 8-K, are available on our website in the investor relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Robin Loudermilk, Chief Executive Officer, Ken Butler, Chief Operating Officer and Gil Danielson, Chief Financial Officer. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor Statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and the other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under risk factors in the company’s 2007 Annual Report on form 10-K, including, without limitations, the company’s projected revenues, earnings, and store openings for future periods. Robin, Gil and Ken will have a few remarks and then we will open the floor up for Q&A. Robert? Robin C. Loudermilk We’re quite pleased with the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results were very strong. Even in these difficult times, our customers continue to come to our stores to get basic home furnishings products. With the credit continuing to tighten and uncertainty in the air, I believe over time we will continue to see an increase in our business, as more and more individuals see the value of Aarons’ programs. These strong financial results continue to be negatively impacted by the new store start-up expenses related to a large number of stores that we opened during the last year or so, but as we've slowed the growth this year, this new store drag has decreased, as expected, and is returning to more normal levels. We finalized during the quarter, the sale of our Aaron’s Corporate Furnishings division, which allowed us to pay down some debt, which proved to prudent in this time of uncertainty. This sale will allow us to focus on our faster growing, large market Aaron’s Sales and Lease ownership concept. To maximize our success in this concept, we must remain focused on servicing and collecting, or as we call it, renting and renewing, from our approximately 1.1 million and growing customer base. Our plans for the next several years are to grow, on average, our store base in the range of 5 to 9%. The store growth was less than that in 2008 as we consolidated some stores, sold a few stores and had not been achieving our profit goals and taking our breath a little in this tough economic environment, and strengthening our store management team. The slower growth made in previous years, will let us grow over time at a more consistent, predictable and efficient manner, and it should improve future profit margins as we’ve done here in the last year, and overall financial performance. Thank you for your support of the company. I’ll turn it over to Ken for a few comments and talk about the results of the Aarons Sales and Lease ownership division. William K. Butler Well, thank you Robin and good morning and thank you for your continued interest in Aarons. Once again, I want to thank all of our associates, franchisees, partners and vendors in all teaming together for the most eventful quarter in our history. The highlights were numerous and I’ll start off by mentioning the sale of our corporate furnishings division to CORT. CORT elected not to purchase approximately $18 million worth of inventory at original cost, and consequently our people have been busy emptying warehouses and shipping inventory all over the country into Aarons Sales and Lease ownership stores. Most of the products have been leased, sold or are now sitting in our stores ready and available for lease or for sale. Shortly after this deal, we acquired the assets and stores of Rosey Rentals, our second largest franchisee, with stores throughout the southeast. So really the net effect of these two transactions is that we swapped corporate furnishing stores for what we do best, Aarons Sales and Lease ownership stores. Additionally, during the quarter we converted Tiger John Cleek stores in Missouri, the big University of Missouri fan, to the Aarons program. This is the sixth such transaction like this we have done over the last year and a half, and this one I make mention as Tiger is the resigning president of APRO, which is our industry’s trade organization. We are continuing to work on more of these types of conversions with outstanding operators throughout the country. We’ve also consolidated 20 of our RENCO stores into Aarons stores and now we’re operating with only ten stand-alone RENCO operations, and this small group remaining should be profitable and the 20 consolidations should enhance the profit in the respective Aarons stores. Not to get sidetracked from our biggest event during the quarter, is our continued growth of new customers. That is our number one metric that we look at to determine the overall health of our business, and I’m proud to report that our business is indeed healthy. During the quarter we gained 68,000 new customers. That’s a net gain of our deliveries, returns, charge- offs and customer pay-outs. Last years’ net gain was a respectable 50,000, so our store has gained a whopping 36% more customers than a year ago in the same quarter. Our business climate, as you can imagine, is upbeat and we look forward to continue delivering positive results throughout 2009. Gilbert L. Danielson Thanks, Ken. I’ll go over some of the financial results for the quarter that were in the press release. As noted in the earliest release and we’ve talked about it, certainly the sale of the Aaron’s Corporate Furnishing division was consummated in November. We received just a little bit over $75 million in cash relating to that sale. The company revenues for the quarter, which are now basically from tending the operations, are the Aaron’s Sales and Lease ownership revenues, increased 11% for the quarter and 14% for the year. Annual revenue is almost $1.6 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively and increased their revenues $171.8 million in the fourth quarter and $665 million for the year. They were up 19% in both period and revenues. Although it’s not a GAAP number, if you add the revenues from our company stores and the revenues from our franchise stores that they’re generating at their store fronts, we did over $2.3 billion in total system-wide revenues for the year of ’08. We mentioned that the same store revenue growth in the fourth quarter for the Aarons Sales and Lease ownership company operated stores was 6.2%. Those were stores that were open over 15 months, for stores that were open over two years it was 3.2%. The same store revenue growth for franchise stores was up 13.8%. Quite pleased that we certainly had an increase in net gain in customers and the customer count on a same store basis for our company stores for the quarter was up 12% in this quarter compared to the quarter last year. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $21.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $0.28 per diluted share last year's increase of 39%. Diluted earnings per share for the year were $1.56 compared to $1.46 last year, up 14%. If you just look at the continuing operations, taking out the discontinued operations of the Aarons Corporate Furnishings division, our continuing operations EPS increased 50% for the quarter and 19% for the year. Talked about new store drag for the quarter is becoming more normalized. It was approximately 5% per share in the fourth quarter, compared to $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter last year. Talked about the opening of the stores during the fourth quarter, we opened 26 new company operated stores and 30 franchise stores. Also acquired 18 stores from several competitors, as well as buying one store and selling 11 stores. We had a lot of activity in the fourth quarter with realigning stores, and also as we mentioned we acquired 35 franchise stores near the very end of the fourth quarter. For the 2008 year, we opened 49 new company stores and 58 new franchise stores. After numerous acquisition sales, other realignments, mergers, consolidations and taking out the Aarons Corporate Furnishing stores that we sold, our net store count increase from continuing operations increased 2.9% for the year. Area development agreements on the franchise side were awarded in the quarter to open another 24 franchise stores and for the 2008 year we’ve sold 149 new stores, and the pipeline of stores that are expected to open in various future years at the end of December was 282 stores. Our guidance for the first quarter of ’09 is expect revenues in excess of $445 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.49 to $0.54 per share, and again for 2009 we expect our company revenues to approximate $1.75 billion in revenues. As you noted we raised our guidance slightly for '09 to $1.72 to $1.87 per share. We continue to anticipate our new store growth in '09, new store front, will increase approximately 5% to 9%, kind of a equal mix between franchise and company stores. That will be a net store growth. We anticipate we will still have some consolidation and some maybe some sales of stores in '09, which it will happen. So we're looking at a net store growth of 5% to 9%. We will also plan in '09 to continue to acquire franchise stores compared to independent operators as we've already mentioned or sell company operated stores as warranted to franchisees and perhaps others. These are all done to expand the Aaron's offering, to improve our profitability that makes sense. To swap stores, change stores to franchisees, we'll certainly pursue that activity as we have done in the last several years. Those are basically our comments; we would like to throw it out for questions and answers now."
113,GV_001076_2009Q4,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon, and welcome to the Aaron's Quarterly Conference Call. At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gil Danielson. Thank you, and have a good conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you for joining us today. I'm going to turn the call over briefly to Lee Wilder who will read our standard Safe Harbor statement. And then we'll go ahead and start the prepared comments, and then we'll, open it up for questions. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section. And this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements; including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2008 annual report on Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings, as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Charlie and Ken will have a few opening remarks and then, Gil will add further information. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director All right. Thank you, Lee. I appreciate the introduction. I think you saw on our release out there, our fourth quarter results were at the high end of our earnings guidance. We are certainly pleased with our company-operated stores having same-store revenue growth of 5.2% and customer growth of 10.6%, both of which were in line with our expectations. In addition, although net revenues of Aaron's, Inc. are franchise stores' expansion, 8.9% growth in same-store revenues during the quarter. The total of our corporate and franchise customers were up 16% over the same period last year. And Aaron's business model is performing well in this current economic environment although many of you know, we have performed well through the years in all types of economic cycles. Business picked up in the fourth quarter as the holidays approached, and we've had good momentum going in 2010. I should note that the non-retail sales, sales to our franchisees basically through our Fulfillment Centers, in the fourth quarter were up 12% in dollars over the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 30% in unit volume. These strong numbers are higher than the past several quarters and a reflection of the growth product demand from our franchisees to service their growing customer base. MacTavish Furniture Industries', our manufacturing arm and bedding plants, shipments were $72,417,000, up 5% over 2008. That is up 5% even though we discontinued operations of our Office Furniture manufacturing facility. We continued to realize efficiencies in our manufacturing, and material costs had decreased in this current environment. And we continued to refine our manufacturing process going forward. The Aaron's Office Furniture stores continue to struggle and we are working hard consolidating stores and management to make changes that will improve overall financial performance. The Office Furniture market is difficult in this economy, to say the least. However, we are definitely not satisfied with the performance of these stores, and expect improvement in financial performance as we continue through the year in 2010. During 2009, we increased our net system-wide store count by 8.8% over the previous year, which was at the high end of our guidance. Our plans for 2010 are unchanged as we are looking to increase store count by approximately 5% to 9%, as we stated last year, over our number of stores open at the end of calendar year 2009. Thank you for your support of the company. And I will turn the call over now to Charlie for a few comments. And then, Ken will talk about the operating results of his division. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Well, thank you, Robin. I just want to say that I really, really appreciate all the hard work and time and effort that our associates have put in to build this company. I know quite a few are on this call right now and I want to tell them specifically and let them spread the word that I really do appreciate all this hard work. And they've made this company what it is today. And I and all and [ph] everyone else is very proud of this company, and how we operate, and the ethics that we exhibit, and the feeling that we have toward all of our customers as well as each other in the system. So that's my comment. The other gentleman will talk about the operation itself. Ken Butler, tell us. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Thank you, Charlie. Good afternoon, and thank you for your continued interest in Aaron's. And our goal is to keep performing at a level to never lose your interest. Our number one key metric to determine the overall health of our business is customer growth. We focus on this daily in each store and satisfy each and every customer, one customer at a time. During the fourth quarter, we gained a record number of 75,461 new customers. That is a net gain of new customer deliveries, minus customers who return their product, minus customers who pay up their product and exit the system, and minus customers who are written off the books. For the year, we have a net gain of 176,571 new customers. These gains in our customer base are a direct result of the tremendous job our folks are doing in the stores day in and day out, and a testimony to the strength of our program and our focus on satisfying the customer. And we do expect to continue on with our new store expansion program, with approximately 90 new company-operated stores and 75 new franchise stores to open in 2010. We expect to merge or sell or close 15 to 25 underperforming stores this year. These numbers do not include any store conversions of existing competitive rental operators. We continue to seek good existing rental dealers to convert their stores over to the Aaron's brand, and have proven this is an additional method to strengthen our franchise program. I'm also proud of the fact that we're being recognized by a number of other business groups for the results and efforts of all of our fellow associates and franchisees. Just recently, Business to Business magazine awarded Aaron's as the Company of the Year for 2009. Additionally, in October, the U.S. News & World Report did a detailed study of more than 140 retailers with annual revenues of $250 million or more, looking over their performance for the last three years and came up with their top 10 performers. And I'm proud to say we were one in that group. Also, Aaron's has been recognized by the United States Armed Forces Foundation with a Patriot Award for our support in 2009 of the men and women who serve our country. All of our associates seemed to rise to the occasion of what needs to be done to help our local communities, our country and our fellowmen, and these awards are a great tribute to our culture and kindred spirit that we possess every day at Aaron's. Gil? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Ken. I'll hit some of the highlights of the quarter. Company revenues increased 10% for the quarter and 10% for the year. Our annual revenues this year were $1.753 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues 14% in the fourth quarter and also 14% for the year. The annual revenues for the franchisees were $759 million. Revenues of franchisees are not, of course, revenues of Aaron's, Inc. Same-store revenue growth met our expectations in the fourth quarter with 5.2% and 4.6% for stores that are two years old. For the stores that are over five years old, which is again five years is just a point in time, it doesn't necessarily mean it's mature, the same-store revenue growth was 2.5%. And as we mentioned, same-store revenue growth for franchise stores was 8.9%. As Robin mentioned, our total number of customers in the system went up 15% for the year, and the customer count in the quarter, in the fourth quarter, on same-store basis for the company-operated stores, they were up 10.6%. We did, again, for the first time in a couple of quarters, we saw the dollars in non- retail sales, which are shipments of new product to our franchisees, went up 12% for the quarter. And then as Robin mentioned, the total units went up 30%. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter rose 19% to $25.0 million, and net earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year were $112.9 million, again up 32% from last year. The net earnings from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter were $27,000 when compared to $69,000 in profit for fourth quarter of last year. As you all recall, I guess it was about 15 months, 16 months ago, we sold our Aaron's Corporate Furnishings to -- and that is our discontinued operation. And the number is getting smaller every quarter, it'll probably disappear in '10. Fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.46 compared to $0.39 and also, overall diluted earnings per share were $0.46 versus $0.39. For the fiscal year, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.07 for 2009, versus $1.58 in 2008, 31% increase. And overall, diluted earnings per share went up 24% for the year. The company's other revenues in the fourth quarter include $1.6 million of gains from the sale of assets of company-operated stores in the quarter. Other revenues for the fiscal year include gains from the sale of stores of $7.8 million in 2009 and $8.5 million at 2008. During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Aaron's sales and lease ownership division opened 25 new company-operated stores and 21 new franchise stores, also acquired one franchise store and sold 10 company-operated stores to a franchisee. In addition, during the quarter, four company-operated stores and two franchise sales on lease ownership stores were closed along with two company-operated RIMCO stores. As we have done for the last couple of years, we have been doing realignment of stores, the activity has not been as much as it had been earlier in the year, but we will continue to do that in future periods as warranted. The new store drag for the quarter, for the fourth quarter, we opened five new stores and new store drag was approximately $0.07 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, and that compares to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The Franchise system remains strong. During the quarter, we awarded area development agreements to open to 28 more franchise stores. And for the year, we awarded 159 area development agreements with 159 stores. At the end of December 2009, there are 259 franchise stores award that are expected to open over the next several years. At December 31, we had 1,071 company-operated sales and lease ownership stores open, 590 franchise stores, 11 company-operated RIMCO stores, seven franchise RIMCO stores and 15 Aaron's Office Furniture stores, for a total of 1,694 stores open. We continue to carry cash on hand. At the end of December, we had $109.7 million of cash on hand versus $7.4 million for the same period in '08. Our guidance for the first quarter of 2010 is to expect revenues of approximately $485 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.62 to $0.67 per share. Our revenue guidance for the fiscal year for 2010 is to achieve approximately $1.85 billion. We didn't change our earnings per share guidance for 2010 other than what had previously been presented, and it's still in a range of $2.15 to $2.35. During the year, we generated approximately $194 million in cash flow from operations. And we had positive same-store revenues in all but one of the 14 states for the quarter. We had positive same-store revenues in all but one of the 14 states that we do business in that had unemployment rate of over 10% in December. The only exception to that, Nevada had unemployment of over 10%, but we only have three stores in Nevada. That's pretty much a recap of the quarter. And we'll certainly turn it over for any questions you might have now."
114,GV_001076_2010Q4,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon. I would like to pass the conference over to your host, Mr. Gilbert Danielson, CFO of Aaron's Inc. Thank you, you may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Well, thank you all for joining us this morning. As is our normal routine, I'm going to turn the call over to Lee Wilder, and she'll introduce us and read our standard Safe Harbor statement. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I am Assistant Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today are Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Robin Loudermilk, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2009 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings as well as store acquisitions and disposition activity for future periods. Robin, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments, and then Gil will add further information. Robin? Robert Charles Loudermilk Former Chief Executive Officer, President and Director Thank you, Lee. As you can imagine, we are quite pleased with our fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2010 results, which were both records for the company and again exceeded our expectations. Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership continues to grow in revenues, customer count, storefronts, both company and franchise, and most important, profitability. We continued to show excellent new-store growth potential and an expanding customer base, which should drive revenues for years to come and continue to improve the relative metrics mentioned above. None of this would have been possible without our dedicated special corporate associates and franchise partners. As we've been saying for some time now, we believe that the current economic environment will continue to be somewhat favorable for our business. We did very well in recent years when credit was easy and employment was quite good. Aaron's business model is not recession-proof, but it has proven to be recession-resilient. We have held our own for several years now in some of the highest unemployment areas in the country. We believe as economic outlook brightens and the employment picture improves, we feel that Aaron's will be positioned to serve more customers who will find our monthly lease programs superior to others' higher-priced alternatives for acquiring household goods. We're constantly looking for ways to increase revenues and earnings. As many of you recall, last fall, we reviewed many of our processes to reduce overhead where appropriate. There are several new initiatives now under way at the corporate level to evaluate technology, restructure functions, reduce costs, increase productivity and improve overall efficiency. Although it's too early to quantify the dollar magnitude of these new initiatives, they will no doubt have a positive effect on future financial performance. Our Woodhaven upholstery and bedding manufacturing plants continue to see increased production and improved efficiency to meet the demand of the growing store base, both company and franchise. The growth of Woodhaven is a reflection of the increased demand of our growing customer base for our high-quality, high-margin furniture and bedding products. Ken will discuss, among other things, our exciting new national, highly targeted TV advertising program as well as our progressive experimental weekly pay-for-your-own-purchase store concept now under way. We look forward to carrying our current momentum in 2011 and are quite bullish on Aaron's future. We believe we have all the ingredients for success, a large and growing potential market, a superior improvement business model, excellent service and products that customers desire and need, experienced novel franchisees, dedicated and hard-working corporate associates and a game plan to succeed. I will now turn it over to Ken for some of his comments. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Well, once again, thank you for joining us today and allowing us to share our operating results with you. We had a great quarter from a customer acceptance standpoint, as we gained over 65,000 new customers for the quarter, and that resulted in better store revenues and higher profitability than anticipated. Our store traffic is brisk, to say the least, as more and more consumers cannot get the basic necessities for the home from conventional lending sources. Credit standards have risen and overall credit scores have fallen as a result of mortgage defaults and high unemployment. Our long-term strategy of positioning our stores with the largest selection of brand-name, brand-new products at the guaranteed lowest prices has been a great match with this new consumer. Our execution at the store level has to be at its best as we acquire and maintain more and more of these customers, who are learning the great value of entering a new lease with Aaron's. To further create more awareness to the everyday consumer, who is now seeing the value proposition of our deal, as Robin mentioned, we began a national TV ad campaign that will run throughout the year and be beneficial to every store in our system. This will be funded out of all of our stores' traditional advertising budget, company-operated and franchised stores. This will have a net effect cost-wise to our P&L of zero, as many of our stores were already paying for local CD and we're now transferring that cost to national programming. It will result in much more exposure to our brand and is a great result of the strength in our numbers. With today's technology, it's easy to target programming and channeling that we know our customer views on a consistent basis. As we look into the future for expansion, we do see the ability to operate 3,000 stores in the USA and are well on our way to accomplish this target over the next few years. The question is what do we do when this happens, and where do we go? So a few answers are, well, number one, we look at international expansion. We've been exploring this possibility and will continue to look at this in the future. Number two, we create other values and services to offer in our existing stores to help fuel same-store sales, and we're experimenting with a few now, with some like prepaid cellular programming and some other things we're not yet prepared to talk about. Rest assured, the payday loan business is not being explored. Number three is create a weekly pay from our purchase model. We're in the business, we know the business, we know how to open and run stores, we already have the infrastructure from IT, real estate, marketing, distribution, accounting, franchising, and management is in place. Due to industry consolidation, there is room out there for another competitor, so why not let it be us? We can get more stores in place more efficiently than anyone. Consequently, we've opened three of these stores for the first time in the fourth quarter, and their name is Homesmart. Thus far, their operating results have been impressive, even by our standards, and we will closely monitor their results on a day-to- day basis. We are also closely monitoring the nearest Aaron's stores results, and as we had projected, the Aaron's stores continue to gain customer count since these new stores have opened. We look to continue to open more of these in various markets, and we believe we can continue to deliver positive operating results, not only quarter-to-quarter, but for many years to come. So at this point, I'll turn the call over for some comments from Charlie. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Thank you, Ken. I obviously am very, very proud of the company results. The company's being run today much better than it has in the history that I've had in 26 years or whatever. Possibility of getting it even greater for our growth, and we have all infrastructure in place to carry this company to a much higher level. One personal question that some of you may have heard, that I had a so-called minor heart attack -- but I've been back in the office for the last two -- over two weeks, maybe three weeks. So I'm here and looking over the guys and making any suggestions I can make about my experience in the rental business and so forth. So things is doing real well, but I must, must thank all of our associates for the hard work they have put in, in the last year. They do it every year, and it seems like they get better and better and operate better and better. Gil, you want to make a comment? Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Yes, I'll go into the highlights of the fourth quarter. Company revenues increased 9% for the quarter, $484.4 million, and 7% for the year to $1.877 billion. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues to $215.6 million (sic) [$215.5 million] for the fourth quarter, a 10% increase for the same period last year, and to $841.3 million for the 12 months, an 11% increase. As you know, the revenues of our franchisees are not revenues of Aaron's Inc. Same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter was strong for the company-operated stores. It was 6.2% and 4.4% for stores that were over two years old. For stores in the system that were over five years old, the same-store revenues were up 2.5%. The customer count on a same-store basis for the company-operated stores was up 7.2% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Same-store revenues and customer counts for franchised stores were up 4.2% and 7.3%, respectively, for the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year. Again, revenues and also customers are not revenues and customers of Aaron's Inc. The company had 912,000 company-operated store customers and 502,000 franchised customers at the end of the fourth quarter, a 10% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the fourth quarter 2009. Net earnings for the quarter were $30.8 million versus $25 million in 2009. Net earnings for the 12 months were $118.4 million versus $112.6 million last year. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.38 compared to $0.31 last year. For the 12 months, diluted earnings per share were $1.44 versus $1.37 in 2009. You won't hear us talking too much about Aaron's Office Furniture next year, but I'll kind of recap it for this year. As you know, we decided to close the operations of the Aaron's Office Furniture division in June of 2010. During the fourth quarter, we closed one Aaron's Office Furniture store, and we do have one remaining store open that will remain open in this year, in 2011, to continue to liquidate merchandise. The fourth quarter 2010 financial results include pretax charges to operating expenses of $893,000 relating to the closure of the division, and for the 12 months, just the write-offs we took in the Office Furniture division to close it were $9 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. The revenues of the Office Furniture stores was $1.6 million and $4.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009, respectively. And the Office Furniture division recorded a pretax loss of $495,000 in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the 12 months of 2010, revenues of the Aaron's Office Furniture stores were $11.6 million, compared to $16.5 million for the same period of 2009, and the pretax losses were $11.6 million in 2010 versus $7.8 million in 2009. Included in those losses are the above charges of $0.07 to close the division. I mention all of that because as we go on now into 2011, this is all behind us, the losses and the write-offs relating to the Office Furniture stores, so there'll be some favorable comparisons moving through '11 versus '10. The company's other revenues in the fourth quarter included $335,000 of store sales in 2010 and $1.6 million last year, and for the 12 months, there were $1.9 million of store sales in this year and $7.8 million last year. During the fourth quarter of the year, the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division opened 31 new company-operated stores and 25 new franchised stores. We acquired the accounts of two third-party operators and sold three company-operated stores to two different Aaron's franchisees. We also closed one RIMCO store and one Office Furniture store during the fourth quarter. For the year, we opened 91 new company-operated stores and 72 new franchised stores, and the total net store count for the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership stores was exactly 8% for the year, which was pretty much the number that was certainly in our range and what we have been predicting and guiding to. For the three months and 12 months ended December 31 of this year, we have awarded area development agreements to open 53 and 120 additional franchised stores, respectively. At the end of December, there were 282 franchised stores awarded, and are expected to be opened over the next several years. At the end of December of 2010, the Aaron's Sales and Lease Ownership division consisted of 1,138 company- operated stores, 658 franchised stores, 11 company RIMCO stores and six franchised RIMCO stores. We also had one Aaron's Office Furniture store to give us a total at the end of December of 1,814. At the end of December, we had cash on hand of $72 million. During the year, we acquired in the open market 1,478,805 shares of common stock. This included 1 million shares that we acquired in the fourth quarter, and we have current board authorization to purchase an additional 4.4 million shares. Our guidance for the first quarter of the new year is to set revenues at approximately $530 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.48 to $0.52 per share. Our revenue guidance for 2011 is to reach approximately $2 billion and fiscal year diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.61 to $1.77. As has been the case for the last several years, we anticipate new store growth of 7% to 9%, and for the most part, in the new year -- and for the most part, an equal mix between company-operated and franchised stores, there will be a net store growth after any consolidation or sales of stores. Our goal for 2011, common internal goals that we're really shooting for is to reach $3 billion in systemwide sales -- systemwide revenues, I should say, total revenues. It's a non-GAAP number, but basically consists of adding up all the revenue of the company and all the franchised stores' revenue that they're generating in their storefronts. Again, I believe that the company will certainly have $2 billion in revenues this year, and we're working on the franchisees that's going to be closed [ph], and so that's kind of the internal goal. All in all, it's a record quarter, record year, and we couldn't be more pleased. And we'll certainly answer any questions that anybody would have at this time."
115,GV_001076_2011Q4,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Aaron's, Inc., Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host, Gil Danielson with Aaron's, Inc. Thank you, and enjoy your conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay, well, thank you. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As our standard procedure, I'm going to turn it over to Lee Wilder to read our Safe Harbor statement, and then, we'll have some opening comments. And then after the comments are done, we'll certainly take some questions and answers. So, Lee? Lee Wilder Good morning. My name is Lee Wilder and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued last night and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. With us today: Charlie Loudermilk, Chairman; Ron Allen, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for these historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2010 annual report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings as well as store acquisitions and disposition activities for future periods. Ron, Ken and Charlie will have a few comments and then Gil will add further information. Ron? Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you, Lee, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. It's certainly a pleasure for me to be a part of my first Aaron's earning call as a member of the management team. And while I've been a Board member since 1997, I'm enjoying being hands-on in learning about the business from the inside, and what a great company Charlie Loudermilk has built. We have a very dedicated, knowledgeable and experienced management team. And as I'll learn more about the Sales & Lease Ownership business, I have a much clearer understanding of how Aaron's has been so successful and has consistently outperformed our competitors over the years. Also, I'm very encouraged about the future growth and earnings opportunities that lay ahead for us. And in addition to getting around to visit our stores and operations over the last 3 months, much of my focus has been working with the management team on developing a plan to allow us to grow in a more efficient, better-structured and focused way which will result in even better financial performance and great returns to our shareholders. I, with those comments, now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Ken. And after Charlie speaks, Gil Danielson will go into more detail, and then we'll be happy to answer your questions. Ken? William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes, well, thanks, Ron. I'd like to, first of all, share our core business results. We continue to prove our outstanding model as we netted a net gain of 84,452 new company and franchise customers in the fourth quarter of the year. And for the year, we gained a net of 151,359 new customers. This record result represents a total increase of 11% over last year. Consequently, revenues in company-operated stores increased 8% for the year, allowing us to exceed our internal goal of $2 billion in revenue for 2011. Our franchise revenue goal of $1 billion fell a little bit short primarily as a result of lower same-store revenues than in previous years. Many of our franchisees have attempted to raise their average income per customer, we call that AIC, over the last couple of years by shortening the term of their agreements and raising the lease rate to the consumer. This has proven to be flawed as their delivery activity went down as the customer saw prices beyond their budget. As you can recall, our company-operated stores began packaging to longer-term 24-month agreements a couple of years ago in order that we would have pricing that could fit our customers' budgets. As a result, our company-operated stores have continued to show positive same-store comps, even those economically challenged environment. As a result, our franchisees then began following this lead at the beginning of the fourth quarter and responded with their greatest increase in customer gain in their history. Our opportunity for improvement lies in increasing our AIC in the future, and we are launching several initiatives in 2012 that should bring about favorable results. We are very pleased with the customer acceptance of our new HomeSmart brand. We still see no significant cannibalization of the brand with the Aaron's store that competes in the market. During the quarter, we continued to assemble our HomeSmart team with the promotion of Marco Scalise to VP of Operations, as well as the appointment of Mark Rudnick to VP of Marketing. Additionally, we have a veteran group of proven regional managers and general managers running the stores. At the beginning of 2011, we had planned on opening about 25 new HomeSmart stores, but as the result of 3 opportunistic acquisitions, we've ended up with, the year with 71 HomeSmart stores. As a result, our start-up costs and advertising expenses exceeded our original forecast. Our plan now is get the model profitable as a group and look at this as a great expansion opportunity for 2013 and beyond. We are definitely proud of our past performance and all of our work and dedication of our fellow associates and franchisees, but we're even more excited about our future. Now I want to turn the call over to Charlie, our Chairman and Founder. Robert Charles Loudermilk Founder and Chairman Emeritus Thank you, Ken. Thank you, Ken. I understand that Bloomberg came in with an article. I had lunch with 2 of the Bloomberg journalists yesterday, and some questions were asked and I answered them to the best of my knowledge. Everybody knows that I'm very blunt and very honest. And the question really was, ""Would you sell the company? Would you be for selling the company?"" I don't control the company now. The answer is, if a, as I understand the world, if a sizable offer comes in, it's my obligation to take it to the Board. And the next question was, would I sell my stock? And I said that the, since my son is out of the business and I may, before, I would look at the company differently. As to the stock, I said, no, I'll maintain the stock. So anyway, I wanted the opportunity to explain what Bloomberg says. But anyway, the future of the company is very, very bright. It always has been. It depends on, of course, management, we could open many, many stores. We have the management capability to do it and that's been the fact since I opened the first store with one employee back in Atlanta, Georgia, 57 years ago. It's always, the market's always been there. It is now, it's just a matter of us executing. But it's a very good business, it's a very interesting business. We have core people who've been here for many years. And one time, we didn't have the money to open the stores. Now it's a matter of us continuing the way we've been running this store. This is -- I've been trying to run it like Walmart. We have a distribution center within like 200 miles of every store. That's been there -- guys, I got a little cold. But anyway, all the things that we are doing that our competitors have not done. We've known the company would always work 19 different distribution centers and so forth. But net-net is that, although we haven't grown in recently, like the, I would like, we still, we've grown and we're still very profitable. And if we get to continue on with opening stores [indiscernible] extremely well. I guess, that's it. I'm here for any questions, but that's that. I'll turn it over to Gil. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Yes. I'll kind of highlight the third quarter and the 12 months on the financial numbers. And then once I'm done, we'll take some questions. So just the highlights for the quarter and the year. The company revenues increased 8% for the quarter to $523.5 million and also 8% to $2.024 billion. So on the company, it's a milestone for the company, we reached over our $2 billion revenue mark in 2011. In addition, our franchisees collectively increased their revenues for the quarter to $225.6 million and $908.9 million for the year. So if you add the revenues of the franchisees along with revenues of the company, we ended about $2.9 billion in revenues that's being recorded at the Aaron's stores, the company and the franchised stores combined. Same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter for the company-operated stores was 3.7%, and it was 2.1% for the stores over 2 years old. For stores over 5 years old, it was positive, it was up 0.5%. The company had just a little over 1 million company-operated store customers at the end of December and the franchisees had just a little over 500,000 customers. So on, for the year, we -- total customers, both company and franchised customers, were up almost 11% for the year as compared to the year in 2010. The customer count on a same-store basis for the company-operated stores was up 6.4%. And for the franchised stores, it was up just a little over 4%, the same-store customer growth. Net earnings for the quarter were $30.5 million versus $30.8 million in 2010 and for the fourth quarter of 2010. And the net earnings for the year were $113.8 million versus the $118.4 million last year. And as we reported in the earnings release last night, our diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.40 compared to $0.38 last year. And for the year, the diluted earnings per share were $1.43 in 2011 and $1.44 in 2010. We did, in the quarter, we did have a $0.03 diluted earnings per share charge in the third quarter relating to some acceleration of some restricted stock and stock options. And if you add that back with the non- GAAP number, which we've reconciled in the earnings release, so if you add that $0.03 back, the earnings would, for the quarter would've been $0.43 per diluted share and $1.46 for the year. And additionally, as you all have known now, by about, it was just last this month, we recorded in the second quarter a large $36.5 million charge to earnings on the lawsuit that we had in the second quarter. Again, if you add that number back to our earnings for the year, it would have been $138.6 million, up 17% over last year, and EPS would've been $1.75, it would be 22% increase over the 2010 year. The franchise revenues for the quarter were up 2% compared to the quarter of last year. And the company's other revenues in the fourth quarter included store sales in 2011 and 2010 of roughly the same amount of just a little over $300,000. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we opened 16 new company-operated stores, 18 new franchised stores, 8 HomeSmart stores and 3 RIMCO stores. And for the year, the company opened 51 new company-operated stores, 55 new franchised stores, 24 HomeSmart stores and 6 RIMCO stores. And in addition, during the year, and also we did some in the quarter, we've acquired 44 stores from third-party operators and converted them into HomeSmart stores. And we also converted 1 Aaron's store to a HomeSmart store. The total net store count for the company, at the end of 2011 compared to 2010, we are up 7% in total store count for the year. The new store drag for the sales of stores Aaron's -- the basic Aaron's stores we opened during the year, fourth quarter, was $0.04 in the quarter, the same, but basically the same amount as it was in 2010. The new store drags on the HomeSmart stores, as we mentioned in the earnings release, was approximately 3% -- $0.03 per diluted share in the quarter and $0.06 for the year. Through the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, we have awarded area development agreements to open another 17 and 68 additional franchised stores at the end of December. There was 230 franchised stores that were in our pipeline that are expected to open over the next several years. At the end of December of 2011, we had 1,144 company-operated Aaron's stores, 707 franchised stores, 16 RIMCO stores, 71 HomeSmart stores opened and 6 franchised RIMCO stores. We also had 1 Aaron's Office Furniture store, so the total number of stores opened at the end of December was 1,945. Our guidance for the first quarter, as we stated in the earnings release, is to expect revenues of approximately $570 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share; expect the revenues, company revenues for 2012 to be approximately $2.15 billion; and our guidance earnings per share, we didn't change this from previous guidance, to expect diluted earnings EPS in the range of $1.88 to $2.04 in 2012. We continue to expect overall new store growth in '12 in the range of 5% to 7% over the store count we had at the end of '11. This will be pretty much an equal mix between company-operated and franchised stores. We have a few more company stores in there, and there'll be probably a handful of HomeSmart stores also. Our Woodhaven manufacturing plants continued, had a good quarter. They increased production in dollars 6% in the quarter and also 6% for the year. And it was a record year of shipments for Woodhaven. And our plants in manufactured furniture and bedding, they were close to $90 million in shipments and costs for the year. And I just wanted to comment on our association with our U.K. partners, Perfect Home. We've made an investment in the business 3 or 4 months ago. It has been very positive and we continue to be very impressed with the management and owners as well as the U.K. company's business model. And we feel we're learning quite a bit from Perfect Home and we've -- they have also benefited from having access to us so we continue to look forward for the next several years of a mutually beneficial relationship with them. I believe those are the main points I'd like to talk about. And we'll certainly take any questions anybody will have."
116,GV_001076_2012Q4,"Presentation Operator Good afternoon. Welcome to the Aaron's Inc. Fourth Quarter and Year End Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host, Mr. Gilbert Danielson. Thank you, and have a good conference. You may proceed, Mr. Danielson. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. As usual, I'm going to turn the call over to Lee Wilder, who does investor relations for Aaron's. She'll read our standard introduction and Safe Harbor. And then she'll turn over to the management team for comments and then after that, we'll certainly take any questions that you may have. So Lee? Lee Wilder Good afternoon. My name is Lee Wilder, and I assist in Investor Relations for Aaron's. The company's earnings release issued today and the related Form 8-K are available on our website,  in the Investor Relations section, and this webcast will be archived for replay there as well. On the call today, Ron Allen, CEO; Ken Butler, COO; and Gil Danielson, CFO. Before we discuss the results, I would like to read the company's Safe Harbor statement. Except for the historical information, the matters discussed today are forward-looking statements of the company. As such, they will involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including factors such as changes in general economic conditions, competition, pricing, customer demand, litigation and other issues that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed under Risk Factors in the company's 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, without limitation, the company's projected revenues, earnings and store openings and store acquisitions and disposition activities for future periods. Ron and Ken will have a few comments, and then Gil will conclude with his remarks, and then move forward with the Q&A. Ron? Ronald W. Allen Former Chief Executive Officer and Director Thank you, Lee. And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and again, thank you for joining us today. We completed another outstanding year at Aaron's with record results for both the fourth quarter and year end. Company revenues for 2012 exceeded $2.2 billion, and net earnings were $173 million, the best results in the company's history and at the high end of our expectations when the year started. We met our store opening goals for 2012, adding a combined net of 128 company-operated and franchised stores. This is a 6.6% increase in total store count. We had strong same-store revenue and customer growth throughout the year as well. Our balance sheet has never been more solid, with over $200 million of cash and liquid investments on hand and very little debt. Aaron's is certainly well-positioned and ready to continue our growth plans, and we expect to achieve more record numbers in 2013. Our customer base is large, and we have consistently said for quite some time, we believe the current type of consumer credit environment has been good for our business. But our customers continue to be stressed with unemployment levels much higher than the national average. However, the strength of our business model, which provides customers high-quality basic home furnishings with no credit checks, flexible payment plans and highly personalized service, has enabled Aaron's to weather all types of economic cycles. Our business is very much a customer relationship business, and the success of the company throughout the years attest to the superior customer service and the value proposition offered to our customers. As we noted in our earnings release during the fourth quarter, we offered a Black Friday promotion that was extremely successful in gaining agreements and customers. The promotion gave customers the option of immediate delivery of products with no payments until January. We had an excellent response to this promotion, and we delivered a record number of agreements during that time period. The results far exceeded our expectations and did cause a deferral of more revenue than anticipated until 2013, when customers began to pay for their merchandise. Although this revenue was not recognized in 2012, we did record the expense in the quarter associated with executing this promotion. I'm extremely pleased that in January, Andrea Freeman joined Aaron's as our new Vice President of Marketing. Andrea brings extensive experience, knowledge and new ideas to Aaron's marketing promotions and initiatives, and she will be a great asset to us as we find and further develop our strategies. Also during the fourth quarter, we selected new leadership for our HomeSmart division. Roger Estep, a 25- year veteran of the weekly rental pay industry and an Aaron's associate for over 9 years, most recently as a senior regional manager, was promoted to Vice President of the HomeSmart division. And he's bringing in fresh perspective and disciplined management leadership to this weekly concept. The performance of the HomeSmart stores has been encouraging in revenue and customer gains, but we still have a ways to go until we achieve the financial performance needed and expected from this venture. We currently have 78 company-operated stores and 1 franchise store open, As we have said before, we do not anticipate opening any significant number of new stores, and will not plan to open any until possibly the latter half of this year. We do expect the HomeSmart stores to continue to improve in 2013, especially since there will be reduced startup expenses as the existing stores continue to mature and only a few stores will be added toward the end of this year. In closing my comments, I'd like to reflect on my first year as CEO here at Aaron's. It's been extremely rewarding, and we've made great progress in the company, including the achievement of the outstanding financial results and the strengthening of our management team. In my visit to stores across the country, I continue to be impressed with our associates and realized how important it is to maintain a strong relationship with our customers. The ongoing development, training and recruitment of skilled personnel are major components in achieving Aaron's future success. This past year, we focused in building our corporate infrastructure and standards, and significant improvements have been made throughout the organization. Our corporate planning process has been greatly enhanced, and we now have an outstanding human resource concept. There are opportunities and improvements, such as in information technology, that we will continue to work on that will assist our store personnel to better serve our customers in a more efficient, cost-effective and customer-friendly fashion. I look forward to this year as we continue this journey and see the benefits of all the corporate support initiatives began to have a larger impact on the success of the company. Again, thank you for your interest in Aaron's, and I'll now turn the call over to Ken. William K. Butler Former Chief Operating Officer and Director Yes, thank you, Ron, and good evening, everyone. Once again, we had another great year and another strong core for customer growth. Our company and franchise core business remains strong as we gained more than 75,000 new customers for the quarter, which represents an 11% increase in our customer count above last year. This resulted in another successful quarter of positive same-store comps with an increase of 4.6% for the company stores. Our franchise stores have rebounded nicely, landing at 6.5% in same-store comps. We had a very active quarter with new store openings as we opened 37 new Aaron's company-operated stores, 25 new franchise stores, 2 RIMCO stores and 1 HomeSmart store for a total of 66 new stores, which is at or near a record-setting pace. As Ron mentioned, we promoted Roger Estep to VP of HomeSmart, and he and his team are working diligently to make HomeSmart a brand that we will be proud of and a brand that can follow the same pathway already put in place with Aaron's with new company-operated stores and a new franchise concept as well. We have no new stores on the horizon at this hour, as our mission is to stabilize the management team, focus on the business fundamentals of the model and bring the system to profitability this year. We continue to see no signs of cannibalization to the nearest Aaron's store with the model. One of our initiatives this year and in the past has been to stabilize and begin increasing our average income per customer, which we refer to as AIC. We are beginning to see favorable signs that would indicate we are on the right track. Our AIC in December of this year actually matched that of December of 2011, and our average number of agreements per customer eclipsed 1.5 agreements for the first time in our history. This past few years, our customers have been challenged economically, and I'm proud and thankful for their loyalty, and to all the challenges our associates meet each and every day. I thank them all for their hard work and their dedication. I think it should be noted with our 2012 total revenues were more than $2.2 billion. And adding in the revenues that our franchised stores do. They obtained $975 million. Not only do we exceed $3 billion in revenue, but we also would exceed any other operators in our industry. So at this point, Gil, I'll be happy to turn it over. Gilbert L. Danielson Former Executive Vice President Thanks, Ken. I will just go through some of the highlights of the fourth quarter and the fiscal year that were outlined in the earnings release. The company revenues increased 9% for the quarter to $568.5 million and 10% for the 12 months to $2.22 billion. In addition, our franchise lease collectively increased their revenues, as Ken talked about a little bit, to $242 million for the fourth quarter and up, toward for the year to $975 million. That was a 7% increase for the quarter and also for the year. Same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter for our company-operated stores was 4.6%, and for those stores that were over 2 years old, it was 3.1%. Just as an aside for stores that were over 5 years old during the fourth quarter, the same-store revenue growth was 1.9%. Same-store revenues for franchise stores for the quarter were up 6.5%, and customer count was up 9.6% for the quarter. Revenues in customers of franchisees, however, are not revenues and customers of Aaron's, Inc. At the end of the year, we had 1,134,000 company-operated store customers and 604,000 franchise stores. That's 11% increase in total customers over the number at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. The customer count on a same-store basis for the company-operated stores was up 7.8% for the quarter. Net earnings for the quarter were up 20% to $36.6 million versus $30.5 million in 2011. Net earnings for the 12 months were up to $173 million versus $103.8 million last year. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share were $0.48 per share compared to $0.40 last year. And for the 12 months, diluted earnings per share were $2.25 compared to $1.43 in 2011. As you know, last few quarters we've had a couple of special charges in the financials and the reversal of a charge we made a year ago. If we exclude the charges that we've had over the last couple of years on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, net earnings would have been $36.6 million compared to $32.7 million for the same period of 2011, and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.48 versus $0.43, a 12% increase for the quarter. And again on a non-GAAP basis, net earnings for the 12 months of 2012 would have been $157.4 million compared to $138.6 million last year, and diluted earnings per share would have been $2.04 versus $1.75, which would be a 17% increase for the year in diluted earnings per share, excluding the special charges and reversals. The revenues of the HomeSmart division were $14.8 million for the quarter compared to $8.9 million for the quarter a year ago. The division did record a pretax loss of $1.7 million this quarter versus $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. For 12 months, revenues of the division were $55.2 million compared to $15.6 million for the same period last year. The HomeSmart division just made a little improvement, I guess, but we still lost $7 million this year, which was versus $7.3 million last year. So it's certainly some improvement in HomeSmart, and we'll certainly answer any questions on that. Franchise revenues were up 7% for the fourth quarter, the revenues that we recognize on our income statement, compared to the same quarter last year. And for the 12 months, the franchise revenues were up 5%. Ken talked a little bit about it, but for the fourth quarter of 2012, we did open 37 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 26 franchised stores, 2 company-operated RIMCO stores and 1 company-operated HomeSmart store. We also had a few other, smaller transactions during the quarter. At the end of December of 2012, we had 1,227 company-operated Aaron's Sales & Lease Ownership stores, 742 Aaron's franchise stores, 78 HomeSmart stores, 1 franchised HomeSmart store, 19 company-operated RIMCO stores and 6 franchise RIMCO stores. Total store count, obviously a record, over the 2000 mark. At the end of December, we had 2073 stores. During the 3 months and 12 months, we continued to award area development agreements to new and existing franchisees. We awarded 9 area agreements -- development agreements in the quarter and 45 additional franchised stores. At the end of December of 2012, the area development agreements outstanding will be opening, in the future and the next several years, of 180 franchised stores. Our guidance for the first quarter of 2013 is revenues of approximately $630 million and diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.70 to $0.74 per share. Our earnings guidance for the fiscal year of 2013 is unchanged, and we expect to achieve diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.25 to $2.41. We continue to expect our overall new store growth in 2013 to be in the range of 4% to 6% over this -- over our store base in 2012, again, for the most part, an equal mix between company-operated and franchised stores and perhaps including a handful of HomeSmart stores. Those are our comments, and we'll certainly answer any questions that anybody may have."

With that having been said, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much, Joe. Good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q4 2010 and the fiscal year as well as some of the goals for fiscal year 2011. Then after my short presentation, I'll ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of Sales and Marketing from North American Medical to give an update on their respective businesses. We will then take questions. Clearly, the challenge for Q4 was net income. Q4 net income per share was flat year-over-year, mostly due to higher operating expenses. We finished Q4 at 42.1% of sales and include a $1.5 million non-cash stock compensation charge and lower gross margins due to sales mix, higher non-cash compensation charges, a higher incentive pay for year-end bonuses. While most of these are temporary, we believe the mix of lower OEM products will negatively affect gross margins next year. However, if we can manage the sales and marketing costs operating margins should continue to expand. Q4 '09 operating expenses were 39 - Q4 '09 operating expenses were 39.8% of sales and the total cash stock compensation charge last year was 443,000. Our net income per share for Q4, excluding the charge would have finished at $0.16 versus $0.12 reported today and we'll talk more about this later on the call. We finished the quarter and the fiscal year with record sales. Q4 sales totaled $33.7 million up 28% year- over-year and up 8.6% quarter-over-quarter. For fiscal year 2010, total sales were up 18%, finishing at just 125 - just under a $125 million. Record Vet sales for Q4 at $25 million were up 28% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, total Vet sales finished at $92.4 million up 25%, an excellent performance considering this difficult market. Total North American sales for Q4 finished at a record $27.6 million, up 24% year-over-year and up 10.8% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, North American sales hit a milestone totaling more than $100 million for the first time, finishing at $101million 4000,000 up 15% year-over-year. Total international sales for Q4 of $6.1 million were up 48% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. For the year, international sales were at record levels totaling $23.2 million up 30%. European sales for Q4 totaled $4.8 million, up 50.9% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. For the year, European sales finished at $18.5 million, also a new record up 32%. Pac-Rim sales for Q4 finished at $1.2 million up 38% year-over-year but down about 2% quarter-over- quarter. For the year, Pac-Rim sales totaled $4.6 million, also a new record up 24%. Worldwide medical sales for Q4 finished at $6.9 million up 36% year-over-year and up 33% quarter-over- quarter, a positive indicator our new strategy is working. For the year, Medical sales totaled $24 million, down about 2.5% but at a level we can clearly build from. Government sales for Q4 finished at $774,000 up 9.6% year-over-year and up 64% over last quarter's depressed levels. For the year, government sales totaled $3.6 million down 19.5%, mostly due to lower instrument sales in Q3 and Q4. Total instrument sales in units finished very strong for the quarter at 1,065 units up 350 units or 49% compared to Q4 last year. In dollars, total instrument sales finished up 36%. Slightly lower average selling prices on chemistry instruments and a mix of lower priced I-Stat and co-ag units were the reason for the lower percentage increase in dollars. For Q4, we sold 399 VetScans versus 345 last year and 572 last quarter. For the year, we sold 1,722 VetScans, up 13%. We sold 236 hematology instruments versus 177 Q4 last year and 256 last quarter. For the year we sold 894 hematology instruments up 11%. We sold 150 Piccolos, including six units to the government versus 96 Q4 last year and 134 last quarter. The run rate of non-government Piccolo instrument sales is as follows, Q4 '09 82 units, Q1 2010 88 units, Q2 '10 168 units, Q3 2010 130 units and Q4 144 units. So far, we're seeing a nice quarter-over-quarter build. For the year, we sold 576 Piccolos down about 19% due to the change in strategy. And finally, we sold 288, 280 co-ag and I-Stat units versus 97 Q4 last year and 250 last quarter. For the year, we sold 844 co-ag and I-Stat instruments versus 97 in fiscal year 2009. For the year, we sold a total of 4,036 instruments up 29% or 897 units. The total disc sales were also at record levels, finishing Q4 at 1.542 million units up 14% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. In dollars, disc sales finished Q4 up 12% year-over-year and 17% quarter- over-quarter. For the year, total disc sales totaled 5.731 million units up 9%. In dollars, total disc sales finished up 12%. Medical disc sales had 582,430 units for Q4 2010, a new record were up 41% year-over-year and 51% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, Medical disc sales totaled 1.888 million units up 10% and Vet disc sales finished at 3.844 million units up 8%. 22% of total sales were capital sales while 78% were consumables. This compares to 21/79 Q4 last year, 27/73 last quarter. For the year, the mix was 23/77. 18% of total sales in Q4 were international sales while 82% were domestic. This compares with 16/84 Q4 last year and 20/80 last quarter. For the year, international sales represented 19% of the total and domestic 81%. 20% of total sales Q4 2010 were medical sales, 74% Vet and 6% other. This compares with 19/74/7 in Q4 last year and 17/77/6 last quarter. For the year, medical sales were 19% of total sales, Vet 74% and 7% other. Discuss average selling price for the year finished at a record $12.56 up $0.42 versus FY '09 or up 3%. Average disc cost for the year of $4.07 was down $0.31 or about $0.07 versus FY '09. Total disc gross margin finished at 68% for the year up about 360 basis points versus last year. Gross margins for Q4 2010 were up 19 basis points year-over-year, finishing at 55.9%. Gross margin quarter-over-quarter, however, was down 310 basis points mostly due to a higher incentive pay, costs associated with moving our disc molds to a higher volume factory, lower royalty revenue and higher sales of OEM products. To help everybody understand the impact of OEM products on gross margins early in the sales cycle, I've broken out the gross margin for our core products that include chemistry and hematology instruments as well as consumables manufactured in our factory. The history is as follows. For Q4 FY '09, core product gross margins were 55% for the whole year of FY '09 54%, Q1 2010 58%, Q2 2010 59%, Q3 2010 60% and Q4, the quarter we just finished, 2010 59%. Now for the year, total gross margin for FY 2010 was up 237 basis points and finished at 57.9%. Gross profit for the quarter finished at $18.820 million up 28% year-over-year and up 2.9% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, our gross profit was up 23%. As I mentioned earlier, operating expenses for the quarter finished at 42.1% of sales up 230 basis points year-over-year, including the $1.5 million non-cash compensation charge. Total expenses for the year at $51.3 million or 41.2% of sales, were up 255 basis points versus last year, mostly due to the non-cash compensation charge. Sales and marketing expenses for Q4 finished at 26% of sales versus 24% of sales Q4 last year and last quarter and were up due to costs associated with the full consolidation of the I-Stat business and the incentive compensation paid due to the extraordinary Q4 28% sales growth in our Vet business. For the year, sales and marketing expenses, including non-cash compensation charges, finished at 24% of sales versus 23% of sales last year. R&D expenses, including the charge at 8% of sales was down from 8.5% of sales Q4 last year and 9% of sales last quarter. For the year, R&D expenses finished at 8.6% of sales compared with 7.9% of sales last year. Admin expenses, including the charge of 8.3% of sales were down from 7.2% of sales Q4 last year and 8.2% of sales last quarter, mostly due to the non-cash charge. For the year, admin expenses at 8.4% of sales versus 7.3% of sales last year. Operating income finished Q4 2010 at $4.642 million, up 11% year-over-year but down 14% quarter- over-quarter, mostly due to higher incentive pay and lower gross profit. Ex the non-cash charge, operating income would have finished at $6.266 million or up 35%. For the year, operating income finished at $20.8 million up 17%. Excluding the non-cash charge, operating income would have finished at $26.1 million up 34%. Net income was negatively affected by foreign exchange losses and higher taxes and finished flat for the quarter at $0.12 compared to Q4 last year. For FY 2010, net income totaled $13.23 million up 8% or $0.58 a share. Excluding the non-cash charge, net income would have totaled $16.619 million or $0.74 a share. On the R&D side of the business, we're focused on the development of hemoglobin on the disc for both the Vet and medical markets. Expansion of the rapid test menu is also a high priority. We expect most of the product development and submissions to the regulatory authorities will be completed this year. Goals for 2011 include keeping the sales and earnings growth at double digits with a goal of $1 a share in earnings. Implementing our new segment focused marketing and sales strategy in the medical market and expanding that sales force once all of our marketing assumptions are validated, expanding our market coverage and in the vet market with a focus on maintaining our sales momentum and improving productivity and reducing costs as a percent of sales, completing the development of hemoglobin in four more rabbit tests for the vet market, reducing expenses as a percent of sales and a continued focus on new factory initiatives and investments to make progress on the 2-by-2 goals. Now as I've mentioned over the last few quarters, I exercised a 70,000 share stock option that was close to expiring in October of '08 and because the price of Abaxis stock was so unattractive, I borrowed the cash from a bank to exercise the option and pay the taxes. Because of this obligation, I may sell some Abaxis stock over the next few months to pay back the bank. In addition, because the tax law changes in 2011, I may also exercise other vested options in this calendar year and may need to sell some stock to pay the options, price and tax. With that out of the way, Marti, you're on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I'll break out a few numbers for the Abaxis North American Animal Health business. The North American Animal Health organization generated revenues of $20 million in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, up 22% or $3.7 million year-over-year and up 6% or $1.2 million in the record revenue reported last quarter. For the fiscal year, Animal Health recorded revenues of $72.8 million, up 23% or $13.5 million versus same period last year. For the fiscal year, instrument revenue was up 5%, in terms of total units and all our instruments provided for a recurring reagent business, FY '10 was up 37%, our shipping a record 2,604 instruments. The moderate revenue increase compared to the significant unit sales increase, the overall blended instrument ASP decline is attributable to the rapid acceptance of and our bundling of the lower cost blood gas and coagulation instruments with our chemistry and hematology offering. This has allowed us to continue to penetrate the overall market and we expect will allow us to sustain the rapid growth in our business. Instrument revenue in Q4 was $4.3 million up 17% year-over-year. Consumable revenue for the quarter was up 24% from a year ago and up 16% versus Q3. For the fiscal year, our consumable revenue was up 29%. Abaxis integration and consolidation of the i-STAT business, while requiring investment, was seamless to the marketplace. The team here, field sales, sales management, customer service, tech service and professional services, product management and marketing all did a great job representing to the marketplace Abaxis as a world class, customer-centric organization. I'd like to also we significantly stepped up marketing efforts in other areas in Q4 with aggressive new branding to support the expanded VetScan instrument and consumable product line. In support of these products, we increased and broadened the marketing mix with continuing education programs, new e- lead generation programs, direct mail, increased advertising and new multimedia, promotional programs underway. We also increased trade show and conference participation at all levels. We added headcount in field sales, professional services and customer service and plan on more organizational and infrastructure enhancements this quarter as well, while as Clint mentioned, the goal now on a go-forward basis, keeping expenses in line with the rapid revenue growth. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you very much, Marti. Brenton, you're next. Brenton Hanlon Thanks, Clint. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q4, we continued to focus on repeatable and scalable approaches to penetrating the U.S. point of care testing market and at present we view the market in terms of two macro segments, the small practice segment and the medical system segment. The small practice segment is our traditional market and we continue to focus on internal medicine physicians, merging care centers and oncology clinics. We've stabilized the sales organization and all of our empty territories are now filled, which means at present we have 15 sales people in the field along with three managers and a full-time field training specialist. The second macro segment, large medical systems is new to us and we've enjoyed some early success. This segment includes integrated delivery networks such as hospital systems, merging care chains, wellness organizations, older care chains, reference laboratories and retail clinics. In Q4, we finalized an agreement with another large hospital system, a leading institution in the Pacific Northwest. We also expanded within two large accounts that we had closed in Q3. These types of accounts are complicated sale, but once customers experience the benefits of the Piccolo, they tend to increase their usage over time. This business has a long sales cycle and it's difficult to forecast, but as we ride the learning curve, we hope to close at two large accounts per quarter. As for actual results, Q4 instrument revenues were $936,000 or 86% higher year-over-year and 22% higher quarter-over-quarter. We shipped a total of 128 instruments, which was below our record 196 placements in Q3. Q3 is traditionally our highest instrument placement period due to distributor promotions and year-end tax credit effects. But in my mind, the key metric is our Q4 placements were 78% higher than the same period last year. Of the 126 Piccolos we've placed in Q4, 85 were revenue units into our traditional small practice segment. 16 were additional reagent rental units for our health screening company that we closed in Q3. This company now has 42 Piccolos running our orders. 12 units were additional revenue units for an urgent care chain in Texas that we closed in Q3 and 15 were the initial reagent rental units for the hospital system that we closed in Q4. I'm encouraged that approximately 35% of our Q4 Piccolo placements were within the large customer segment in which we are able to leverage our selling activities. Turning to the rotor side of our business, Q4 rotor sales were 3.8 million, which was 40% higher year- over-year and 39% higher quarter-over-quarter. With the sales channel properly balanced, we now expect rotor sales to more closely track new instrument placements. So in summary, overall Q4 sales were $4.9 million, 46% higher year-over-year and 39% higher quarter- over-quarter. Going forward, we plan to continue to grow our customer base on the relatively predictable small practice segment and we plan to systematically expand our presence within the higher risk, higher reward medical systems segment with the goal, as I mentioned, of closing two large accounts each quarter. Thank you. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Brenton. Okay. With that, we're open for questions."

Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q1 FY 2010 and some of the goals for Q2. After my short presentation, I'll ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Rick Betts, our Director of North American Medical Marketing, to give an update on their respective businesses. We will then take questions. Well, our Q1 was truly a fantastic quarter in a difficult operating environment. We finished the quarter achieving for Q1, anyway, my goal for 2010 of getting back to double digits in sales and earnings growth. The challenges for the quarter were fewer than the past and centered mostly on small regulatory approvals. Our Heartworm on the disc is still at the USDA awaiting clearance. But we believe we have answered all their questions and expect an approval within about 30 days. The C-Reactive Protein test in the amended 510(k) for magnesium, which includes CLIA Waiver, is still at the FDA. And we do need to pursue an alternative for the bili [bilirubin] calibration for the CLIA Waiver status. So the slowness in regulatory has slowed these projects but we believe we're making good progress. The change in our medical sales and marketing strategy has shown successes with total Medical sales up quarter-over-quarter, but total Medical sales for the quarter were down year-over-year. We'll have more on this to follow in a few minutes. The accomplishments for Q1 include breaking many records: we broke records for total sales, total Vet sales, total Disc sales, total domestic sales, international sales, Disc gross margin at a record, gross profit at a record, operating earnings at a record and finally, a record net income. We finished Q1 with total sales of $29.6 million, up 21% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Record total Vet sales at $21.8 million were up 31% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. Total Medical sales finished at $5.8 million, up 13.5% quarter-over-quarter but down about 11.7% year-over- year. The reason for the drop year-over-year is our new strategy of not shipping new instruments in the distributor inventory. For the quarter, we sold 833 instruments versus 804 instruments Q1 last year and 715 instruments last quarter. We sold 388 VetScans® versus 415 Q1 last year and 345 last quarter. We sold 149 Piccolos® versus 208 Q1 last year and 96 last quarter. So the 192 hematology instruments versus 181 Q1 last year and 177 last quarter and finally, 104 coag [coagulation analyzers] instruments versus zero Q1 last year and 97 last quarter. Total disc sales finished Q1 at record levels of just under 1.5 million units, up 23% in units and 31% in dollars. Record vet disc sales of over 1 million units at 1,024,000 were up 32% in units and 40% in dollars year-over-year and up 8% in units and 9% in dollars quarter-over-quarter. Medical disc sales of 429,123 were up 6% in units and up 8% in dollars year-over-year and up 4% in units and 5% in dollars quarter- over-quarter. North American sales of $24.1 million were up 19% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter, also another record. European sales of $4.4 million were up 30% year-over-year and up 37% quarter-over- quarter, a very nice recovery after adjusting to this new more challenging selling environment. Sales in the Pac Rim finished Q1 at $1,119,000, up 25% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter, another nice rebound considering this challenging market. Total International sales of $5.5 million, a record, were up 29% versus Q1 last year. Government sales for Q1 at $1,348,000 were down slightly year-over-year by about $73,000 but were up quarter-over-quarter by about $641,000 or 91%. Domestic sales made up 81% of the total sales for Q1 2010 and International sales made up 19% of the total. This compares with 83%, 17% Q1 last year and 84%, 16% last quarter. Medical sales made up 19% of total sales for Q1 2010, Vet sales were 74% of the total and Other made up for 7%. This compares with 26%, 68%, 6%, Q1 last year and 19%, 74%, 7% last quarter. Capital sales made up 21% of total sales while Consumables came in at 79%. This compares with 32%, 68% Q1 last year and 21%, 79% last quarter. The Disc average selling price finished at a record $12.68, up $0.78 or 6.6% year-over-year and up $0.15 or 1% quarter-over-quarter. A good mix and a weaker dollar helped achieved this record. Disc cost came in at a record low of $4.03, down $0.30 versus Q1 last year and down $0.47 compared to last quarter. Disc margins finished at a record 68% versus 64% in Q1 last year and last quarter. A good mix in Consumable sales and strong Disc margin led to record gross profit in a 58% gross margin, up 300 basis points year-over-year and up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Operating expenses for Q1 included a non-cash, stock compensation charge that totaled about $850,000 and finished at 38.6% of sales. Without this charge, expenses would have finished at 35.7% of sales. This compares with 38.6% of sales Q1 last year and 39.8% of sales last quarter, another improvement. Sales and marketing expenses of $6,360,000, including the non-cash compensation charge, finished at 21.5% of sales, down from 23.7% of sales Q1 last year. R&D expenses of $2,573,000, including the charge, were 8.7% of sales, up slightly from 8.1% of sales compared to Q1 of last year. And admin expenses at $2,498,000 or 8.4% of sales, including the charge, were up from 6.8% of sales Q1 2009. Strong gross margin and excellent expense control led to record operating earnings of $5.7 million or about $0.26 a share, up 42% year-over-year and 36% quarter-over-quarter or about 19% of sales. We also achieved record pre-tax earnings of $6.2 million, up 39% year-over-year and up 44% quarter-over- quarter. Record net income of $3.8 million was up 35% year-over-year and 45% quarter-over-quarter or $0.17 a share compared to $0.12 Q1 of last year. On the R&D side of the business, we are preparing for the scale up of the heartworm on the disc and the CRP, pending of regulatory clearance. We are setting up a recalibration study for the bilirubin in a major university using HPLC, so we can resubmit this test for CLIA Waiver. In addition, we are continuing work on more rapid test that we believe could be launched within about a year. The Vet Marketing and Sales team worldwide is working on the launch of the heartworm on a disc and the launch of the Abaxis' i-STAT® product line. We have made a hiring decision on the Vice President of North American Medical Sales and Marketing and it'll be announced within a few days. Goals for Q2 include, of course, maintaining our sales and earning momentum and keep them growing at double digits. Launching our new Vet products, keeping our Medical sales team focused on our key segments and expand the team and initiating a new engineering cost-reduction plan that we call the two- by-two [ph] with the goal to achieve an instrument cost of $2,000 and a disc cost of $2. Now before I introduce Marty and Rick, I'd like to comment on the 70,000 share option that was close to expiring that I exercised in October of last year. Because the price of Abaxis stock was so unattractive, I borrowed the cash from a bank to exercise the option to pay the taxes. The goal was to pay this loan back within a year. Now because of this obligation, I may choose to sell some Abaxis stock to pay back this loan over the next couple of months or some time next quarter. So with that, I'd like to introduce Marty. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks I will provide a brief overview, breaking out a few numbers of the Abaxis' North American and Animal Health business. We generated record revenues of $17 million in the first quarter of our fiscal year, up 32% or $4 million year-over-year and up 4% from our prior-record quarter, Q4 '09. In the U.S., our Instrument revenue was impacted by the acquisition of a key third-party financing partner, a strong and very popular financing program for a month while we sought out alternatives, interviewed, selected and finalized the program with another company able to administer it. It was a complex program and we had significant diligence to do. Despite that, we succeeded in selling a total of 476 instruments, 26 more than Q1 last year but 47 fewer than last quarter. The lease program has now been relaunched with a new third-party financing partner and they are performing very well. The availability of credit, the economic uncertainty and the global recession may have had a negative impact on instrument sales last quarter as well. Our continued emphasis on the Consumable end of our business resulted in growth of 56% versus a year ago and 10% growth versus Q4 '09. This rapid growth was fueled by hematology reagents, up 43% and chemistry rotors, up 41% from a year ago. May 7, we announced a worldwide animal health marketing and distribution agreement with Abbott Laboratories. This agreement with Abbott's Point of Care division gives Abaxis exclusive and worldwide marketing rights in the animal health field to the i-STAT® 1, a handheld instrument for blood gases, electrolytes, certain blood chemistries and immunoassays. This instrument complements the VetScan® very, very well. Filling a couple of gaps for us such as in the blood gas arena and single glucose testing. The agreement was effective in May as a non-exclusive arrangement but is effective November 1, 2009, a worldwide exclusive agreement other than for Japan, where it remains non-exclusive. The synergy between this Abbott Point of Care division product and the Abaxis' animal health product line is clear and compelling. We are dedicated to providing quality in vitro diagnostic [IVD] products, exceptional customer service, product support and technical expertise, which includes now the i-STAT® and the i-STAT® current customer base. We have begun servicing and supporting both end users and distribution worldwide, and we anticipate launching the new Abaxis VetScan® i-STAT® 1 products in our third quarter this fiscal year. We believe this product, combined with the Q4 launch of our coagulation instrument, the VSpro and our launch in the first of a series of lateral flow rapid diagnostic test, allows Abaxis to provide veterinary practices, the instruments and supplies it needs to conduct in-house, virtually all the diagnostic testing that was routinely sent out through a commercial lab or possibly performed on instrumentation that is less reliable, slower or with higher operating costs. Now when the challenges we face is getting our capacity or our infrastructure to be more in line with their opportunity, the good challenge to have, by that I mean, we need to do all of the following: We have to continue to provide exceptional day-in and day-out service and support of the rapidly-growing Abaxis customer base. Secondly, we have to continue to increase utilization at the customer side, providing us organic growth for chemistry rotors and hematology reagent packs. Third, we have to provide and we will provide more products into the existing Abaxis customer base, such as the i-STAT®, the VSpro and our Canine Heartworm Rapid Test, now alongside and used in conjunction with their chemistry and hematology instruments. Conversely, address the opportunities in the existing i-STAT® customer base adding new Abaxis products such as the VetScan VS2, VetScan HMII, VetScan HM5, the VSpro and the VetScan Canine Heartworm Rapid Test. Number five, we need to expand, of course, our market penetration through continuing conversion of business from competitive products, the commercial lab or both are now providing the Abaxis solution inclusive across our entire product lines. And then finally, while accomplishing all of the aforementioned, as Clint mentioned, we are also very busy preparing for a launch of the rotor-based Canine Heartworm Antigene Test, which will be the first Point of Care comprehensive canine wellness profile that includes a heartworm test. We anticipate broad market acceptance, rapid adoption and significant demand for these new products as soon as we hear from USDA. To that end, we just graduated a class of 14 grades, new regional account managers. This brings our field sales team now to 16, we plan on continuing to appropriately build the organization this fiscal year and into next. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much, Marty, and now I'd like to introduce Rick Betts, our Director of Marketing for the Medical side of our business. Rick? Rick Betts Former Director of Medical Sales & Marketing - Medical Diagnostics Thank you, Clint and good afternoon, everyone. Before I relay the results for the Domestic Medical division for Q1, I want to take a moment to thank the individual members of the Medical division for their hard work and perseverance throughout the first quarter. Change is never easy to assimilate and each member of the Medical division should be proud of their accomplishments, professionalism and the momentum that we have built through our new sales and marketing strategic focus. Domestic Medical sales, excluding sales to the U.S. government finished up 7% quarter-over-quarter at $3.68 million. This performance includes 86 Piccolo® placements and 337,000 reagent discs sold, which represents a 7% increase year-over-year. Of the 86 Piccolos® placed, 53 were direct revenue instruments and 33 came from distribution inventory. By segment, the breakouts were: 29 Urgent Care, 21 Internal Medicine, nine Hematology-Oncology, eight Radiology, seven General and Family Practitioners and 12 Multi-Specialty Clinic and Hospital accounts. These breakouts were especially encouraging because 79% of our sales this quarter came from our identified target markets, which is an indicator that the new focus strategy is working. Our national accounts initiative is also beginning to pay dividends through increased traction with larger medical groups, reference laboratories, urgent care groups and consumer base clinic operations. We have received request for proposals from three large national accounts that represent the potential for over 500 Piccolo® placements. Additionally, we recently completed our biannual customer satisfaction survey. The survey continues to be well-received and we saw some interesting results. The Piccolo® received a very high 98% satisfaction rating and over 80% of our customer base has increased the usage of their Piccolo® instruments over time. This tells us that once a physician becomes a customer, they like the technology and continue to find additional diagnostic and treatment uses for it. This quarter, we also implemented a new customer outreach activity that is reaping immediate rewards. We are reaching out to every Piccolo® customer and so far, we have identified 23 customers that were experiencing challenges with their Point of Care operations. We successfully solved the challenges they were experiencing, churned them around, we could regain their satisfaction and they are now actively resuming their Piccolo® usage. And finally, we are proud to announce a key addition to our strategic advisory board. Abaxis would like to welcome Dr. Lee Resnick aboard as our Key Advisor to the Urgent Care marketplace. Dr. Resnick is one of the foremost expert in Urgent Care and is the Immediate Past President of the Urgent Care Association of America. He is also the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Urgent Care Medicine and the Chief Medical Officer of NextCare Urgent Care. We look forward to utilizing Dr. Resnick's experience and guidance as we expand our presence in the Urgent Care market. Goal for the second quarter are: First, the hiring and training of four new regional sales managers as well as a Central Area Director, which will bring our team to full strength at 16 RSMs and three Area Directors. Second is the key expansion of our strategic advisory board with the key addition for the Oncology sector. We look for continued penetration into the Urgent Care, Internal Medicine and Oncology markets through focused marketing and lead-generation initiatives. Upon receiving FDA approval, we will initiate the launch of the C-Reactive Protein assay across the United States. As defined to in the sales effort, we are implementing live web demonstrations across our sales organization. This new process increases the interest and engagement at point-of-sale. And in support of promoting consistent messages and positioning across our sales organization, we are creating a comprehensive sales playbook for the top markets we serve. And with that, I will turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you very much, Rick, and now we're open for questions."

Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you Joe, and good afternoon everybody. I will spend a few minutes here reviewing the accomplishments and the challenges for Q1 FY 2012 and then some of the goals for Q2. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Sales and Marketing on the vet side and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of North American Sales and Marketing on the medical side to give an update on their respective businesses. We will then take questions. In Q1 we spent time and money working on four projects that could produce excellent returns in the future. However there were a drag on the earnings and management distraction last quarter. We spent about 750,000 in legal expenses associated with the FTC investigation of a competitor and the Cepheid paten suit. Our laboratory project we’re working on with K-State University is starting to take more management time and investment and we booked about $523,000 in start-up expenses in Q1, but we still got to starting taking samples in September. We also had a significant evaluation of Piccolos that could include up to 50 beta sides that started in Q1 with three sites set up. While these investments of time and money negatively affected our financial performance in Q1, the upside for the last half of the year could more than make up for the short-term drag. International sales for Q1 were clearly disappointing coming in at $6.3 million, down about 12% versus Q1 last year. And lower sales in Japan along with a difficult comparison in Europe were mostly the cause. Q1 last year, our European distributor that orders its discs by container, ordered two containers, and this year only one. We believe this would be made up in Q2 or Q3 when the distributor will order the second container in the quarter. Royalty income Q1 2012 was lower by about 400,000 compared to Q1 last year due to the patent dispute with Cepheid. Even with these challenges and distractions, we did grow the business about 3% versus Q1 last year finishing the quarter at $36 million in sales. Our sales to the government was strong and totaled 1.1 million up 43% or about $323,000 versus Q1 last year and up 53% versus last quarter. Worldwide medical sales finished Q1 at $7.2 million and were up 11% versus Q1 last year, or down about 5% quarter-over-quarter. Domestic medical sales were up 18% year-over-year, but medical sales to the Pac Rim were down 43% and medical sales to Europe were down 9% and more to follow-up from Brenton in a few minutes. Domestic sales in Q1 totaled $29.7 million, up about 7% year-over-year, but down about 3% versus Q4’s record levels. Domestic vet sales were also up 7% finishing at 22.6 million and more to follow-up from Marty in a few minutes. As I mentioned before, European sales came in less than expected for Q1 and totaled 5.2 million, down about 5% quarter-over-quarter and down about 8% year-over-year. Had the two containers shipped, sales to Europe would have been at or close to record levels. Each container contains about 80,000 discs and is worth about $1.1 million in sales. Sales to the Pac Rim finished at 1.1 million, down 27% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter. Difficulty in Japan and the timing of some distributor orders were the main reasons for the shortfall. For the quarter we sold 1,017 instruments down about eight instruments compared to Q1 last year and in dollars instrument sales totaled 7.5 million, up 3% due to higher average selling prices. Instrument sales in the U.S. were up 13% over Q1 last year, while international instrument sales were down about 18% mostly due to lower sales in the Pac Rim. Quarter-over-quarter total instrument sales were down about 4%. We sold 367 VetScans versus 377 in Q1 last year and 427 last quarter. We sold 250 hematology instruments versus 246, Q1 last year and 226 last quarter. We sold 172 Piccolos, including 23 to the government versus 163 last year and 173 last quarter. U.S. Piccolo sales, excluding government sales, finished Q1 at 104 units versus 76, Q1 last year and in dollars, domestic Piccolo sales, these are instrument sales totaled 1.1 million, up 44%. Quarter-over-quarter U.S. Piccolo instrument sales excluding the government, were up 16% in units and dollars. And finally we sold 228 i-STAT and COAG instruments versus 239 last year and 248 last quarter. Domestic disc sales at 1.6 million units or flat in units, compared to Q1 last year mostly due to the one container in Europe versus the two containers Q1 last year. Domestic disc sales at 100,234 units were up 4% versus Q1 last year. In dollars, disc sales finished at 20.7 million, up 3% due to higher average selling prices. Quarter-over-quarter, disc sales were down 10% in units and 8% in dollars. Total Vet disc sales at a million units were down 5% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter and in dollars Vet disc sales were flat year-over-year and down about 8% quarter-over-quarter. Other Vet consumable sales that include rapid test, i-STAT and Coag cartridges and hematology reagents finished Q1 at 6 million, up 15% year-over-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter. Medical sales at 564,000 units were up about 8% year-over-year down 9% over last quarter to record level. In dollars disc sales was 12% year-over-year and down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Twenty percent of total sales were medical sales while 77% were Vet and 3% other. This compares to 18%, 77%, 5% of Q1 last year and 20%,76% and 4% last quarter. Twenty- one percent of sales were capital sales, 79% were consumables. This compares with 21% and 79% in Q1 last year and 21% and 79% last quarter. 17% of total sales was international while 83% was domestic. This compares with 20% and 80% in Q1 last year and 18% and 82% last quarter. The Vet added selling price finished Q1 at record levels breaking our goal of $13 to finish at $13.01, this is down to $0.48 or 4% versus Q1 last year. A small domestic price increase in April and a weaker dollar versus the Euro and mix were the main reasons. Quarter-over-quarter this disc average selling prices were up $0.29 or 2% and this cost came in at a record low just under $4, finishing at $3.98 down about $0.4 year-over-year and $0.40 quarter over quarter. Disc gross margin also finished at record high at 69%. Even though we had record growth margins on reagent discs, a loss of $400000 in royalty income and strong sales growth of lower margin OEM products resulted in lower gross margins, which declined about 3.2% to 53.4% compared to Q1 last year. Quarter-over-quarter margins were down about 1.1%. As we see continued success of the two-by- two program and higher volumes of disc sales we should see these margins start to expand later in the year. Operating expenses excluding the investments in our records lab finished at $15.5 million or 43% of sales, which is up from 39.6% of sales in Q1 last year and 40% of sales in Q4. Legal expenses of about $750,000 due to the patent suit, the SEC issues discussed earlier contributed to this increase in expenses. Including the Reference Lab expenses totaled $16 million or about 45% of sales. Sales and marketing expenses for Q1 2012 totaled $9.2 million or about 25.4% of sales up from 24.7% of sales in Q1 last year and 24% of sales last quarter. This is mostly due to the addition of 13 new sales people on the Vet side of the business. R&D expenses for Q1 finished at $3.5 million or about 9.6% of sales, up from 8.8% of sales in Q1 last year and 7% of sales last quarter. Expenses associated with the final development of the two rapid tests and the R&D contributions to the two-by-two program were the main reason for this higher investment. Admin expenses excluding the investment in the new lab of $2.9 million or 8% of sales is up from 6.1% of sales in Q1 last year is down from 9% of sales last quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to higher legal expenses discussed earlier. Higher expenses along with lower gross margin had a negative effect in operating earnings which finished at 3.2 million, down about 2.8 million or 36% compared to Q1 last year. Quarter-over-quarter, operating income was down by about 2.1 million or about 40%. Net income of 2.2 million or $0.10 of share was down from $0.16 a share in Q1 last year and $0.15 last quarter. While we don’t provide guidance, we are positioned well for Q2 goals that include getting our sale growth back to historically levels along with getting our Reference Lab up in running. We are starting Q2 with a record, average, disc selling price along with record low costs and have 13 new field sale reps on the Vet side of the business hired last quarter. So we should see nice instrument sales and disc sales growth here. We expect to see stronger international sale due to the timing of some distribution orders and some recovery in Japan. Our focus on the significant Piccolo beta testing site is also a priority for Q2 and Q3 with the goal of helping our potential customer collect all the data they need to make point-of-care testing a success in their facility. On the R&D side of the business we had submitted the outline of production proposal and a clinical trail protocol to the USDA for the manufacturing of one of our two new rapid tests and expect to start clinical trials this quarter. We have ordered the parts need to manufacture the hemoglobin test on a disc and expect to test the manufacturing scale-up in the next couples of months. Once this is finished, we'll submit that to the FDA for 510-K approval. As you can see from the disc cost results, our 2x2 program is progressing from a drag on factory costs to a benefit. The multi-cavity molds for the disc cover and the barcode ring are scheduled for Q3 and could result in a material cost reduction of about $0.20. The 2x2 project continues to be a priority for the rest of the 2012. With that Marty, you’re on. Marty Mulroy Sorry guys who are new here. Good afternoon and thank you Clint. In my prepared remarks, I will provide some further detail pertaining to the North American Animal Health business. Our first quarter fiscal year 2012, North American Animal Health generated revenue of $22.4 million, down 4% from our prior quarter’s record revenue of $23.2 million primarily due to rotor sales, but up $1.6 million or 7% from the same period last year. Rotors were down primarily to the prior quarter, primarily due to some distributors advancing purchases ahead of a price increase. However, rotor revenue was up 5% from a year ago. With the competitive landscape as it is, I believe we still have some significant pricing power in the marketplace for most of our product line. Now, hematology reagents generated record revenue in the first quarter FY12, up 37% from a year ago in dollars and up 32% in units. Versus the prior quarter, hematology reagents were up 36% in dollars and up 40% in units. Our Parvovirus Rapid Test was launched in March of this year and our Giardia Rapid Test was launched in May. Along with our Heartworm Test we now offer three lateral flow diagnostic products. Total rapid test sales for Q1 FY12 were $1.5 million, up 36% from year ago and up 6% from last quarter. We shipped 633 instruments in Q1 in comparison to 593 a year ago, up 7%. At the clinical level, we sold 690 instruments into 406 clinics, of which 64% we were not previously doing business with. So we brought in last quarter, 258 new instruments customers. As the economy continue to struggle veterinarians continue to look for ways to reduce operating cost, add efficiency and be more competitive. Laboratory services are often the first place and the natural place to start. Some organizational changes and updates Effective July 1, we now have 57 sales people in the fields. To support the increased number of sales people we promoted Casey Rinehart from Regional Account Manager to sales manager for our new Mid Atlantic sales area. We now have nine area sales managers and with our 57 sales representative and five veterinarians in professional services, giving Abaxis Animal Health 71 full time employees in the field working with our distributors, our customers and all of our future customers. We also promoted Dr. Keith DeJong from professional services representative to manager of clinical services. Dr. DeJong joined Abaxis in September 2009 after completing his residency in clinical pathology at the University of California California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. He became a diplomat at the American College of Veterinary Pathology in December 2010. Prior to his residency, Dr. DeJong was in private practice in the New York Metropolitan Area. Dr. DeJong’s new position based here in (inaudible), he will have a broader and more global customer support role particularly as it pertains to AVRL Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratory is on track for our nation-wide launch in October. The team, beginning with the executive staff hired in what will be the AVRL hub in Olathe, Kansas, are partners at K-State University in Manhattan, Kansas, the team here in Union City at Abaxis Corporate and with the participation of our advisor board and some very well known and highly respected consultants all collaborated and completed development of a very comprehensive and somewhat aggressive business plan back in January. So, far I am pleased to report that they have executed flawlessly. As I said on last quarter’s call, early indications of Abaxis provision of routine critical care and emergency laboratory medicine at the point of care, via it’s instrumentation and rapid diagnostic products, coupled with now being able to provide the balance of the market place’s laboratory testing needs through our Reference Lab facilities will be very well received. I want to once again thank and congratulate the North America Animal Health Group on a great start to our 2012 fiscal year and I look forward to reporting our Q2 results in September. And with that back to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you Martin. Okay next I would like to introduce Brenton Hanlon, our VP of North American Medical Business. Brenton Hanlon Thanks Clint and good afternoon everyone. Today Clint and I are calling from Atlanta, we are attending the AACC, that’s the American Academy of Clinical Chemists. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of interest from the point of care testing at this year’s convention and we gathered around 150 solid leads which is a lot for a show like this. At several levels we are seeing more and more evidence that our revamped value proposition is taking root. In FY2011, our top two distributor partners grew sales 78% and 66% respectively. And Q1 we continue to build upon our ever improving distributor relationships and distributor productivity. One indicator of our progress in this regard is the award we received in May from McKesson. Of the 1500 manufacturers they represent, McKesson singled out Abaxis for their Power of Partnership awarded. As Clint indicated, US non-government Piccolo revenues increased 44% in Q1 this year compared to Q1 of last year and our rotor revenues increased 6%. In total North American sales increased 15% compared to the same period last year. In the physician office sector, our most active segments continue to be urgent care centers, family physician groups and internal medicine practices. In Q1 we launched an aggressive direct mail campaign, complemented by space advertising in order to drive more leads. Earlier results from these efforts have been encouraging. And so we are continuing to conduct our very popular regional symposia which feature which feature an Abaxis consultant who is an expert in reimbursement and billing combined with the Head of the Production Services at OHSU with a specialist in Point of Care testing. These symposiums have been very well received by local physicians and the mixed event will be held in Cincinnati, August 4th. Piccolo is also participating in the Ambulatory Care Practice of the Future project at a major medical center in the Boston area. Our hope is that the report from the study will recommend physicians include Piccolo in their practice. Our initiatives in the integrated delivery networks have continued to develop nicely. In Q1 we managed to place our first Piccolo with Stanford University Medical Center and we have six additional ongoing projects in the Pacific Northwest. Typically these types of customers begin with one or two proof of concept sales and expand from there. The sale is complex and the cycle is long, however the rewards for success are significant. Going forward, our overall strategy remains unchanged. We are in un-chartered waters with no models to imitate to a successful implementation of our strategy hinges upon the ability of our team to be creative, learn quickly and make appropriate adjustments along the way. Fortunately, we have on board an excellent team of energetic and innovative people. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Okay, Brenton thank you and now we are open for questions."

With that having been said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will spend the first few minutes in this conference to review new accomplishments and the challenges for Q2 SY ’09 and some of our goals for Q3. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Martin Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing, and then Chris Bernard, our VP North American Medical Sales and Marketing, to give an update on their respective businesses. We’ll then take questions. Despite a difficult environment, we had a great quarter, and had fewer challenges than quarters’ past. The primary challenge for Q2 was lower hematology and Piccolo instrument sales compared to Q2 ’08. Total instrument sales of 734 units were down about 37 units versus Q2 last year. We sold 206 hematology instruments versus 296 Q2 of last year. Last year, we launched our 5-Part Diff unit, the HM5, in September ’07. And with the pent up demand, we had close to a record unit sales in Q2 FY ’08. We sold 167 Piccolos versus 178 the same period of last year. Six quarters of instrument problems along with uncertainty due to the economy were the reasons for fewer Piccolo instrument sales. With the manufacturing problem fixed, we are now in a position to add more purchase options, expand our market coverage, and more aggressively add people, and we expect to see higher unit sales going forward. The bright spot for instrument sales last quarter was the VetScan. We sold a total of 361 units of 22% or 64 units, compared to Q2 last years’ total of 297 units. Lower total instrument sales had a negative effect on gross margin due to the fact that fixed manufacturing costs were spread over fewer units. But total gross margin, however, was up year-over- year and quarter-over-quarter. Quarter-over-quarter total instrument sales were down about 70 units or about 9%. Even though we sold fewer instruments, we had record total sales finishing at about $27.7 million, up 10% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over-quarter. Total vet sales at just under $20 million, $19.9 million, were also at record levels, up 11% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter. While domestic medical sales were at record levels, finishing at about $4.5 million, worldwide medical sales at about $6 million brought only 7% year-over-year and down about 9% quarter-over-quarter due to fewer Piccolo instrument sales. We did, however, record medical disc sales of 434,113 units, up 28% year-over-year and up 8% quarter- over-quarter. Record vet disc sales finished, for the first time ever, at over one million units or 1,003,408 units, up 11% year-over-year and up 29% over last quarter’s depressed performance. In dollars, vet disc sales finished at $13.7 million, up 18% year-over-year and up 32% quarter-over-quarter. With record vet and medical disc sales, total disc sales of $1,437,521, the highest ever for a quarter, and were up 16% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter. North American sales of $22.5 million, also a record, were up about 7% year-over-year and 11% quarter- over-quarter. Record international sales of $5.2 million were up 26% year-over-year and 22% quarter- over-quarter. The strength was in Europe, with total sales finishing at $4.3 million, up 37% compared to Q2 last year, and up 28% over the last quarter. Government or military sales about $1.1 million were flat year-over-year and down about 300,000 quarter-over-quarter. We now have assigned a full time person who will be responsible for government sales, and he’ll focus on expanding our position in this large market. Domestic sales made up 81% of the total for Q2 ’09, and international made 19% of the total. This compares with 84%, 16% Q2 last year; and 83%, 17% last quarter. Capital sales made up 25% of total sales, while consumables came in at 75%. This compares with 30%, 70% Q2 last year; and 32%, 68% last quarter. Medical sales made up 22% of total sales for Q2 ’09, vet sales were 72% of the total, and other made up 6%. This compares with 22%, 71%, 7% Q2 last year, and 26%, 68%, 6% the last quarter. The disc average selling price beat our long term goal of $12, finishing at $12.14, up 2% or $0.28 year- over-year and up 2% or $0.24 quarter-over-quarter. Mix and the domestic vet price increase effective this last April were the main reasons for these results. Disc cost at $4.14 was down $0.28 year-over-year or about 6%. Quarter-over-quarter, disc cost finished down $0.01. Gross profit for discs finished up $0.25 quarter-over-quarter and $0.56 year-over-year. This is a new record for gross margin on disc at 66% or about $8 per disc. Even though chemistry instrument margins finished in the low 40% range, total gross margins for Q2 at 55.4% were up 40 basis points year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Operating expenses as percent of sales finished at 38% versus 38.7% of sales Q2 last year, and 38.6% of sales last quarter. Sales of marketing expenses $6,494,000 or 23.5% of sales were down from Q2s last year’s level of 25.3% of sales, and also down from last quarter’s 23.7% of sales. On the expenses of $2,082,000 or about 7.5% sales were up slightly over Q2 last year’s level of 7.2% of sales, but down versus last quarter’s 8.1% of sales. Admin expenses of $1,952,000 of 7% of sales were up from 6.8% of sales last quarter and 6.1% of sales Q2 last year. Improvements in gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percent of sales led to record operating income of $4,814,000 or about 17.4% of sales. This is up 17% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over- quarter. Pretax earnings of $5,140,000 were up 15% quarter-over-quarter, and 10.6% year-over-year. Net income of $3,297,000 was up 14.2% over Q2 last year, and up 18.8% over last quarter, or $0.15 a share compared to $0.13 Q2 last year and $0.12 a share last quarter. We have cut in all the new parts for our new - from our new vendors for both the VS2 and the Piccolo xpress. These improvements have resulted in a big reduction in infant mortality problems, and should result in higher sales force productivity. We are now making improvements to these new products with the addition of a cooling system that was cut in October 1st. Goals for Q3 include starting the clinical trial for our new CRP test as well as the modifications to the heartworm submissions suggested by the USDA that was submitted last week. Once our clinical trial protocol for the heartworm is approved, we’ll start the trials, which should take about 30 days. We will then submit the data to the USDA for clearance. The clear wave status for CK and phosphorous has not changed. And the latest message to us from the FDA is any day. Q3 is usually a big instrument quarter for us, so we have set aggressive goals for our sales folks worldwide. Marty and Chris will cover some of the programs for the domestic group. And we know our products help customers - our customers save money and make them more productive. So in this tough economy, we have a timing solution. Now, before I introduce Marty, I want to let everybody know I started the first of the process in exercising a stock option of 69,900 shares due to expire in January. I took out a short term loan of about $500,000 from a bank, exercised the options, and paid the taxes. So over the next couple of quarters, I may have to sell some of these shares to pay back the loan. So with that, Marty. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thanks, Clint. The North American varied base contributed a record of - record revenues of $15 million Q2 FY ’09, up 6% year-over-year, and up 16% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year sales of chemistry units were 31%, having sold 266 instruments Q2 ’09 versus 203 units in Q2 ’08. Chemistry units revenue was up 34% year-over-year, at recording $2.1 million of revenue for Q2 ’09 versus $1.5 million Q2 ’08. The consumable business is also again very strong at a record $11.3 million in revenue, up 14% from a year ago, and up $2.4 million or 27% from last quarter. Reacting quickly to market conditions, we just launched a huge 3-Part Differential hematology analyzer to complement our HM5 product release last year. This low cost instrument addresses the more price sensitive market, while providing Abaxis essentially the same margin. Abaxis is now the only one of the three major players in veterinary diagnostics to offer the veterinary clinic a choice in hematology instruments. A key goal for the current quarter is continued emphasis and focus by our marketing team and sales force on the economic advantages and efficiencies provided by the Abaxis laboratory relative to the occurrences. Sales management has programs in place for intense training along these lines, for our field sales force. And these will be marketing this core message in the coming months. As Clint indicated, our Q3 is typically a strong instrument quarter. And we will be working towards some pretty aggressive internal goals despite economy concerns. We also will be following a year reagent resin program that will provide for incremental chemistry placements, drive rotor business, and increase profit margins. Finally, we’ve been working diligently on deepening existing relationships and developing new ones that will provide the synergy to further growth in the North American veterinary business, revenue, margins, and customer base. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you, Marty. Okay. Chris, you’re next. Christopher Bernard Thanks, Clint. Good afternoon, folks. For the quarter, US medical sales minus the military were up 12% at $4.5 million year-over-year, and up 5% quarter-over-quarter. US medical disc sales minus the military were up 45% at 362,000 units, which returned a 46,000 a year ago, and up 15% quarter-over-quarter. With the current economy affecting routine office business, we continue to focus on the higher volume account seeking sick patients, particularly oncology and urgent care. The average daily rotor usage amongst all customers remain steady at 5.2 panels per day. In the US, we sold 111 Piccolos, and had a total placement of 84 systems in Q2 versus placing 97 Piccolos a year ago. In light of the economic pressures, particularly (inaudible) capital purchases and distributor reagent price increases to the offices, we are currently reviewing programs that would mitigate the initial commitment and risk concerns that the offices have expressed. (inaudible) by segment last quarter were 18 FPGP, and then continued strength in the urgent care at 13 and 13 walk-in clinics, for a total of 26 urgent care/walk-in clinics. Two high profile placements was mentioned last quarter. We installed two evaluation units in the two separate LabCorp facilities, and sold our first units to the Kaiser and Cleveland, Ohio. Our top rep recorded 70 Piccolo placements in Q2. From an instrument standpoint, the core was somewhat challenging with the known slowdown of summer coupled with the economy lagging and instrument challenges lease, and just however, continued to remain strong quarter-over-quarter. Goals and marketing strategies for Q3 include our second half of the published national clear list, 55,000 sites received the initial mailing last Wednesday, and the responses are beginning to come in currently. In conjunction with this mail, we’ve targeted the initial 18,000 role offices who daily battle the turnaround time and efficiencies and commercial laboratories. We are six weeks in the PCCS’ lab zone, and the past lab zone has proved to be the backbone to our strong Q3 capital quarter. A recently hired Director of Business Development will be coming onboard this week. He’s solely focused on the health screening, ops, and employee health arena. Recap into Q3, I will be visiting with our top distributors in the coming weeks to discuss additional capital acquisition programs for our POL markets to reduce the commitment and risk initially upfront. Our focus remains heavy on the specialty arena, with an emphasis on the urgent care walk-in clinics. And lastly, we’re in the process of building our 15th sales inventory, which I believe gives us adequate geographic and distribution coverage at the present time. And Clint, that’s (inaudible). Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Chris. And now we’re open for questions."

Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much, Joe. Good afternoon, everybody, and in the next few minutes here, I'll review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q2 FY 2010 and some of the goals for Q3. After my short presentation, I'll ask Martin Mulroy, our VP in North American Vet Sales and Marketing, and Brenton Hanlon, our VP in North American Medical Sales and Marketing to give an update on their respective businesses and then we'll take some questions. First, let's talk about operating expenses. Our operating expenses for Q2 included a non-cash compensation charge of about $1.4 million, up from $434,000 over Q2 last year to finish at $12.9 million or 42.5% of sales versus 38% of sales Q2 last year, and 38% of sales last quarter. In Q1 FY 2010, we recorded a non-cash compensation charge of $905,000. In Q1 2009, that charge was $395,000. The largest increase in expenses was in selling and marketing expenses. Last quarter on the call, we announced that our vet sales team expanded by about 14 folks and our medical team by three. Because of these expansions, sales and marketing expenses finished at $7.6 million, including the charge or about 25.1% of sales. This compares with 23.5% of sales Q2 last year and 21.4% of sales last quarter. We should see these expenses as a percent of sales go down as the new folks ramp up. R&D expenses at $2.6 million or 8.6% of sales including the charge, compares with 7.5% of sales Q2 last year and 8.7% of sales last quarter. Admin expenses have a $2.7 million or 8.9% of sales including the charge, compared with 7% of sales Q2 last year at 8.4% of sales last quarter. Clearly, our investment in sales and marketing was a drag on our Q2 earnings. But if the team hits their objectives, we should see a very positive effect on earnings in Q3 and Q4. Now let's talk about the medical business. We had a great quarter with sales up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. We finished Q2 with worldwide medical sales of $6.3 million, up 6% over Q2 last year and 10% over last quarter sales. Excluding the government medical sales, medical sales were up 9% year-over-year and 23% quarter-over-quarter. We have record medical disc sales of 490,000 units, up 13% year-over-year and 14% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the government medical disc sales, we finished at 453,000 units, up 15% year-over-year and up 19% quarter-over-quarter. Total Piccolo® instrument sales in Q2 at 143 units, while down 24 units year-over-year and six units quarter-over- quarter. Excluding the government sales, they were up quarter-over-quarter by 28 units or 32%. So the rundown is as follows: Q4 '09 when our strategy changed, we have non-government Piccolo® instrument sales of 82 units; Q1 2010 non-government sales of 88 units; and last quarter non-government Piccolo sales of 116 units. So far, the new strategy seems to be working and more to follow from Brandon a little bit later. Now, I'd like to address the updated clearance status of C-Reactive Protein [CRP] and the waivers of magnesium and direct bilirubin. Prior to our 510(k) submission of C-Reactive Protein, the process with the FDA was fairly predictable. It usually took approximately 90 days with about one to four questions. Things are now different. We submitted our CRP on April 10 with excellent data meeting all the requirements. From June through October, we have received 10 requests for more data and information. We responded on a timely basis to nine of these requests and the 10th received last week, we were asked to run an additional 60-patient samples on top of the approximately 40 samples submitted in April. Each submission, before this one, included about 40 to 60 samples run in duplicate on four different instruments. Now the process is changed with ongoing request coming six months after the submission. While we don't understand why it took so long for them to tell us our sample size was insufficient, we will schedule the study once we know and understand all the new rules. Magnesium is a similar situation. Our original wave study demonstrated good correlation compared with the reference method. However, the agency asked us to recalibrate to show even closer correlation, which we did, and with their guidance submitted a special 510(k). We recently received word the calibration change was too big of a change and we would need to start over again with a new CLIA submission. We plan on appealing this ruling and because of these developments, we have put the recalibration project for DBIL or direct bilirubin on hold. We may be required to start over with a new CLIA submission on both of these tests. Neither one of these waivers however should affect our new Piccolo® strategy because in the markets we target, these tests are not routinely run. Now for the rest of it. We had another great quarter finishing Q2 at $30.3 million, up 9.3% year-over- year and 2% over the previous record quarter set in Q1 2010. Total Vet sales of $21.7 million were up 9% versus Q2 last year and showed excellent growth considering the tough comparisons. Q2 last year, we recognized sales for U.S. Vet orders scheduled to ship in Q1 but were delayed due to the economy. In Europe, we shipped two containers of discs in Q2 '09 versus one Q2 this year. Quarter-over-quarter, total Vet sales were about the same. Record domestic sales at $24.8 million were up 11% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter, even with the tough comparisons. Total international sales of $5.5 million were up 4% year-over-year, also that tough comparison in that we shipped in two containers to Europe and only one this year. Quarter-over-quarter, international sales were also about the same. Government sales finished Q2 at $998,000, down 11% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter. Clearly the timing of government orders continues to be unpredictable. We had record disc sales of 1,461,000, up 2% versus Q2 last year in units and 4% in dollars. Total Vet disc sales of 971,000 units were down about 3% versus last year's tough comparison and down about 5% versus last quarters record level. For this first six months, total disc are up 11% in units and 16% in dollars and Vet disc are up 12% in units and 18% in dollars. Marty will cover the North American Vet sales in a few minutes. For the quarter we had record instrument sales of 926 units, up from 734 units versus Q2 last year and 833 units last quarter: We sold 363 VetScans versus 361 Q2 last year and 388 last quarter; 210 hematology instruments versus 206 Q2 last year and 192 last quarter; 143 Piccolos, I covered earlier; and 2010 coag [VetScan VSpro Coagulation Analyzer] and i-STAT® units. 22% of total sales were instrument sales while 78% were consumable. This compares with 2,179 last quarter and 2,575 Q2 last year. 18% of total sales were international sales while 82% were domestic, and this compares with 19, 81 Q2 last year and 19, 81 last quarter. 21% of sales were medical sales and 72% Vet sales and seven, other. This compares with 22, 72, six Q2 last year and 19, 74 and seven last quarter. Disc average selling prices at $12.48 were up $0.34 compared to the same period last year but down 20% compared to last quarter, mostly due to changes in mix. Disc cost of $4.04 per unit were down $0.36 versus Q2 last year but up $0.01 versus last quarter. For the quarter, gross margin on discs finished at 68%, up 394 basis points year-over-year and about the same as last quarter. Total gross margin for Q2 2010 at 59% was up 358 basis points year-over-year and up 108 basis points quarter-over-quarter, a new record. Gross profit finished at record levels coming in  at $17.9 million, up 16% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter. While higher marketing and sales investments in the non-cash stock compensation charge were a drag on operating income, we grew at 4%, year-over-year coming in at $5 million or about 16.5% of sales, or about $0.22 a share. Excluding the non-cash compensation charge, operating income would have finished at about $6.4 million or up about 33% versus Q2 last year. Pre-tax income of $5.3 million was up 3% year-over-year and net income of $3.2 million was down about $100,000 versus Q2 last year or $0.14 a share. Excluding the non-cash compensation charge, net income would have finished at $4.1 million or about $0.18 a share. On the R&D side of the business, we continue to work on the scale up of our Heartworm on the rotor product. With the clearance granted just this month and orders coming in, this project is the highest priority. We'll continue working on the FDA clearance for C-Reactive Protein once we understand all the ground rules and we continue development of more rapid tests. Our 2x2 Project [ph](14:07) is ramping with progress made on process improvements that we believe will lead to cost reductions with increased volumes and close to the goals. Goals for Q3 include maintaining our sales and earnings momentum with the introduction of our new Canine Wellness Profile and the i-STAT® product line. I want to keep our medical team focused on the new strategy and expand our sales force. We also need to keep the 2x2 Project [ph] (14:33) a core priority and keep working on the clearance on the C-Reactive Protein. And as I mentioned on the call last quarter, I exercised a 70,000 share stock option that was close to expiring in October of last year. Because the price of Abaxis stock was so unattractive, I borrowed the cash from a bank to exercise the option and pay the taxes. Because of this obligation, I may decide to sell some Abaxis stock over the next few months to pay back this bank debt. So with that, Marty, you're on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good Afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I will be break out a few numbers to the North American Animal Health business and speak further to the impact of Canine Wellness Profile we'll have in the coming months and years. We generated, once again, record revenues of over $17 million in the second quarter of our fiscal year, up 14% from over $2 million year-over-year but less than 1% from last quarter's record revenue. Fiscal year to date, we have recorded revenue of $34 million, up 22% versus the same period last year. This [indiscernible] (15:51) revenue was up 14% from last quarter but down 4% from year ago. While the availability of credit, the global recession and the and the economic uncertainty had impacted average sell prices, effective promotion and sales execution resulted in our shipping last quarter a record 604 instruments. The recurring revenue from that effort I expect to contribute to sustained growth going forward. Consumable revenue was up 20% from year ago, but down 2% from last quarter's records. We continue the rapid growth year-over-year in the consumable aspects of our business continues to be driven mainly by chemistry. Our rotor revenue in North America up 9% year- over-year. Before I turn the call back over to Clint, I'd like to make a couple of comments in the VetScan Canine Wellness Profile. With the announcement, October 8, Abaxis has changed the paradigm of both routine wellness testing and the common in-clinic Heartworm tests. Now with two drops of whole blood and seconds of hands-on time, the VetScan VS2, with one disposable device, provides the veterinarian in minutes an assessment of the overall health of the animal. It eliminates the technique-dependent manual steps that are prone to error in many Heartworm test and it eliminates the subjective interpretation inherent in some product's visually read results. By Abaxis now providing a more economic, efficient and reliable method, I anticipate an increase in veterinary practices routinely operating this type of testing, increased pet owner acceptance of this testing and our positively impacting animal health in the United States. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Marty. Okay, now I'd like to introduce for the first time our new Vice President of North American Medical Sales and Marketing, Brendan Hanlon. So, Brendan, you're on. Brenton G. A. Hanlon Former Vice President of Medical Sales & Marketing for North America Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon, everyone. This is my eighth week in a management role at Abaxis and I must say the Piccolo® is the most amazing product I've ever been associated with. I'm so privileged to be selling it. I'm also being very impressed by the enthusiasm and commitment of the clinical sales and marketing team. And as for the results, Q2 total sales were $4.4 million, an increase of 20% quarter- over-quarter and flat year-over-year. The flatness in year-over-year revenue was due to the lower instrument revenues, which occurred during our change in strategy. And because of this recent change in our approach, the metric I'm currently focused on is quarter-over-quarter growth rather than year-over- year. Of the $4.4 million in Q2, rotor sales totaled $3.3 million, an increase of 12% quarter-over-quarter and 9% year-over-year. Rotor unit sales in Q2 were 388K, an increase of 15% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over-year. Our new term focus is to expand the Piccolo® customer base and in Q2, we captured 115 new customers. This represents a 34% quarter-over-quarter increase in our new customer acquisition rate, and a 64% increase year-over-year in our customer acquisition rate. This follows a 19% quarter-over-quarter increase in our new customer acquisition rate in Q1. Of the 115 Piccolo® shipped to our new customers in Q2, 47 were from distributor inventories and 68 were shipped directly from Abaxis inventories. The breakdown of new customers by segment was 26 to urgent care or 23%, 24 to internal medicine or 21%, 16 to family practice or 14%, 20 national accounts, four oncology, and 25 other specialties. Going forward, we will be focused not only in the quantity of new customers but also on the quality. To do this, we must improve customer control in order to optimize our resources. For this reason, Abaxis is no longer shipping Piccolos to distributors. This means, that in future, each Piccolo® sale will equal a new customer. Our priorities for Q3 are the following: Number one, simplify and balance our sales channel; number two, improve our account control and improve our management of the sales process itself; number three, better educate customers on the full value of the Piccolo® and customize our message for the different segments; number four, generate more leads and higher quality leads from our target segments of oncology, urgent care and internal medicine; number five, expand the sales management team and three -- fill three empty territories, we filled two empty territories in Q2; and number six, accelerate our sales training programs. In Q2 we closed our first national account, Aurora Clinical Laboratories, which has centers in Wisconsin and Illinois. Aurora purchased 20 Piccolos to perform stat tests in their reference laboratories. In Q3, we plan to close two much larger national accounts which we've been working on for the past few months. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you very much, Brenton, and with that, we're open to questions."

Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you Joe, and good afternoon everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q2 2011 and some of the goals for Q3. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing to give an update on their respective businesses, and then we’ll take questions. Q2 was not only another record sales quarter but also a quarter where we have made significant progress in completing some of our manufacturing improvements with the goal of hitting $2 disc cost. Our first and four new automation lines is in production and we’ll now enter the optimization phase in Q3. The end result will be lower disc cost due to improved quality, due to less handling of the discs and some of the key steps we’re fully automating our priming, staking and deep bidding (ph). Once this is completed, we’ll be fully automated which will lead to reduced costs going forward. We also completed the design for adding a new larger (inaudible) which will allow us to more than double our capacity for bead production to about $150 million beads per quarter. And due to a surge in our shipping of direct orders, we are adding an automated bar code and freight selection system to only the low cost shipper will be selected for a particular order. While disinvestment in factory improvements and increased shipping cost was a drag on total gross margins, gross margins on instruments we manufacture the VS2 and the Piccolo Xpress finished Q2 at near - at a near record 61% versus 57% last quarter and this gross margins finished at 68.1% up 13 basis points versus Q1. These improvements are a result of both good cost control and an increase in average selling prices. As I mentioned before, we finished Q2 with record total sales of $35.3 million, up 17% year- over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Worldwide Vet sales excluding government sales finished at $26.6 million, up 23% year-over-year and about the same as last quarter. Abaxis’ VetScan were at record levels coming in at $21.6 million, up 27% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter and more to follow from Marty in a few minutes. Total worldwide medical sales finished at $6.9 million, up 8% year-over-year and 6.5% quarter-over-quarter. North American or domestic sales finished the quarter at a record $29.5 million, up 19% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter while European sales for the quarter totaled $4.7 million, up 6% year-over- year but down 16% over last quarter’s record level. Total international sales at $574,900 were up 5% year-over-year but down 20% over last year’s record level. Government sales finished at a very strong $1.3 million, up 27% year-over-year and up 70% quarter-over-quarter mostly, due to deals Randy Knick, our sales and marketing guy has been working on over the last two years finally closed. We sold a total of 988 instruments in Q2 2011 versus 926 Q2 last year, up 7% or 62 instruments. In dollars, total instrument sales were up 17% finishing at $7.6 million. Quarter-over-quarter the total instrument sales were down about 37 units but were up $317,000. We sold 383 Vet scans versus 363 Q2 last year and 377 last quarter. We sold 225 hematology instruments versus 210 Q2 of last year and 246 last quarter. We sold 198 Piccolos that included 26 sold to the government versus 143 Q2 last year and 163 last quarter. For those of you that are following the run rate of non-government Piccolo instrument sales is the change in strategy here it is. Q4 ‘09, 82 units, Q1 2010 88, Q2 2010 116, Q3 2010 130, Q4 2010 144, Q1 2011 147 and Q2 2011 172. More to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. And finally we sold a 182 i-STAT and COAG instruments versus 210 in Q2 last year and 239 last quarter. Total disc sales of 151,800 million units were up 4% year-over-year in units and up 6% in dollars. Vet disc sales had a 118,000 were up 5% in units and 8% in dollars. Medical disc sales at 500,000 were up 2% in units and 1% in dollars. Other Vet consumable sales that include heartworm, i-STAT and COAG cartridges as well as hematology reagents finished Q2 at a record $6 million, up 116% year-over-year and up 15% quarter-over-quarter. Domestic sales made up 84% of total sales for Q2 2011, while international sales made up 16%. This compares with 82-18 Q2 last year and 80-20 last quarter. 22% of the sales were capital sales while 78% were consumable. This compares with 22-78 Q2 last year and 27-79 last quarter. 19% of sales were medical sales and Vet sales were 76% with 5% other. This compares with 21-72-7 Q2 last year and 18-77-5 last quarter. The disc average selling price missed all time record by only $0.02 finishing at $12.74 up $0.26 or 2% year-over-year and up $0.21 quarter-over-quarter. Disc cost of $4.07 was up $0.03 year-over-year and $0.05 quarter-over-quarter mostly due to higher shipping cost and the cost tied to the improvements in the factory. As we implement these new efficiency enhance the improvements, we should see disc cost go below $4 in the very near future. While gross profit was up 11% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter gross margin was down three percentage points versus Q2 last year, mostly due to product mix. As I had mentioned before, we had record OEM Vet consumable sales up 116% and they have a lower gross margin products that we make. As we expand our rapid test menu and grow our other OEM product sales, we expect these margins will improve. Overall gross margins quarter-over-quarter were down about 61 basis points mostly due to mix. Operating expenses for Q2 finished at 40.7% of sales, a significant improvement over the 42.5% of sales Q2 last year mostly due to lower sales in marketing and admin expenses as a percent of sales. quarter-over- quarter operating expenses as percent of sales were up 111 basis point quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to higher R&D costs associated with the rapid test development and higher admin cost due to higher incentive compensation. Sales and marketing expenses is $8.4 million or 23.8% of the sales were down versus Q2 last year of 25.1% of sales and last quarter’s 24.7% of sales. R&D expenses at $3.3 million or 9.3% of sales were up from 8.6% of sales Q2 last year and 8.8% of sales last quarter. Part of the development cost associated with the 2x2 projects are also in this numbers. Admin, excuse me, admin expenses at $2.7 million or 7.5% of sales were down from Q2 last year’s 8.9% of sales and up from last quarter’s 6.1% of sales. Operating income of $5.4 million is up 8.2% year-over-year but down 9.3% quarter-over-quarter. Pretax income of $6.2 million was up 16.5% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter and includes favorable versus unfavorable foreign exchange. Net income of $374,900 or $0.17 a share was up 17% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. On the R&D side of the business, the focus was on the rapid test and the hemoglobin development which are in the latest stages of completion. We have also completed the development of the Biochemical Panel Plus test panel that includes C-Reactive Protein, the MKM13 (ph) Piccolo family. This will be introduced at MEDICA which is a large trade show in Düsseldorf, Germany in November. On the business development side, we are working with a large university of Vet school to partner with to provide reference lab, specialty testing services for Abaxis customers. This project has been in the incubating stage at Abaxis for a year. The goal would be to participate in this large market with a partner that can cover a portion of the overhead costs associated with this business as well as the expertise to provide higher quality results. We are in the latest stages of negotiations to make this a reality but want to remind everybody that until we have an agreement, we are not getting the business. Once we have an agreement, we’ll announce it together with all the details. Goals for Q3 include maintaining our very strong sales momentum, pertain to reduce expenses as a percent of sales, completing the development and submit to the regulatory authorities the new rapid test, complete the negotiations with the parties related to the launch of Abaxis reference lab and to continue to meet the objectives of the 2x2 project. Now as I’ve mentioned over the last few quarters, I exercised a 70,000 share stock option that was close to expiring about two years ago. And because the price of Abaxis stock was so unattractive, I borrowed the cash from a bank to exercise the option and pay the taxes. Because of this obligation I may sell some Abaxis stock over the next few months to pay back the bank. In addition, because of the new tax law changes in 2011, and may also exercise other vested options in this calendar year and if I do, I may need to sell some shares to pay the auction price and the tax. With that out of the way, Marty you’re on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you Clint and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks, that will hear some detail regarding the North American Animal Health business. I am very pleased to report the business grew for the tenth consecutive quarter. Our second quarter of fiscal year 2011 generated once again record revenues, $21.6 million. The business grew 27% year-over-year or $4.6 million compared to last quarter where we reported a year-over-year comparison of 23%. So the business growth is accelerating. Quarter-over-quarter, the business increased $800,000 or 4%. The year-over-year increase was led by consumables up 30% while our instrument revenue was up 16%. Highlights include our flagship product VS2, our hematology product line and the VSpro each was up versus the prior quarter. With more than 221 new customers accounting for 392 of the 596 instruments purchased at the clinic level. We anticipate launching at the American Association of Equine Practitioners meeting on December 5, the first fully automated quantitative fibrinogen test. Run on the Abaxis Vetscan VSpro, it is a rapid and reliable assay that can be before - that can be performed in the clinic or patient side in the field. Fibrinogen is an excellent marker for inflammation in the horse and we expect high demand for the VSpro instrument and the associated new cartridges in this marketplace. There are almost 8,000 veterinarians that care for horses of which 4,000 are exclusively Equine. There are also almost 10 million horses in United states again cared for. I’d like you once again thank and congratulate the North American Animal Health Group and the entire Abaxis organization for a job very, very well done. It was once again a very productive quarter in terms of revenue, margins and expanse management. The team here is excited about the current quarter and the opportunity for continued increasing instrument placements and growing revenue. Back to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you very much Marty. Okay, next on board is Brenton. So Brenton, you’re on. Brenton Hanlon Thanks Clint, good afternoon everyone. In Q2 2011, the US medical team continued to implement repeatable unscalable approaches to expanding our customer base. And we added 114 new customers which was similar to Q2 of last year. However instrument revenue showed an increase of 40% year-over- year and a 66% quarter-over-quarter increase for total of $1.3 million. All discrete segments accounted for about 75% of our new customers in Q2. 24% of the Piccolos are sold, we sold went into the urgent care centers, 23% went to family practice offices, 19% to internal medicine practices and 10% to oncology centers. We have a larger medical systems accounts continued to Piccolos in Q2. And urgent care chain increased a number of Piccolos to 19 and so far purchased eight additional instruments in Q3 for total of 27. This customer plans to open 50 more clinics in calendar year 2011. (inaudible) medical training increased at number the 20 and already in Q3 have purchased 10 more for total of 30. And our hospital system increased the number from 25% to 30% in Q2 under reagent rental agreement. We remain encouraged that when we get our foot in the door with these large organizations, we can anticipate growth from within as they enjoy the benefit particular brings the their clinic. Turning to the consumable side about business, Q2 revenues were $3.3 million or 96% compared to Q2 2011 and flat compared to Q2 2010. Since our customer retention is very high, we attribute the smaller than expected router growth to fewer patient visits due to high unemployment rate and to general economic conditions. So despite the confusion and uncertainty in the healthcare marketplace, our overall sales grew 7% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter. I’m very pleased with the way our sales organization is developing. We’ve invested heavily in sales training and we’ve not experienced any turnover for 13 months. Our customers are also pleased with our sales organization. 90% have responded to our most recent customer satisfaction survey indicated that our sales people were very helpful. Going forward, we will further scale up those elements of our strategy that are yielding the best results from the POL segment, and continuing to expand our presence within the high-risk, high-reward medical systems segment. Thank you. And back to you Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you, Brenton. Okay, with that, we’re opened for questions."

With that having been said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Hey, thank you very much and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments, challenges and some of the goals for Q3. Then after my short presentation, I will ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Sales and Marketing for the vet products, and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of North American Medical Sales to give an update on their respective businesses. I will then take questions. So in Q2 we continued to spend time and money working on the 4 projects that we believe will produce excellent upsides in the future. They continue, however, to be a drag on earnings and a management distraction in the short term. We spent about $600,000 in legal fees associated with the FTC investigation of a competitor and the Cepheid patent suit. Our laboratory project we are working on with K State University is up and running and will require more management time and investment. We booked about $1.1 million of startup cost in Q2 and launched it October 1 nationally. We continue to work on the significant evaluation of Piccolos that could include up to 50 beta sites and started in Q1 with 3 sites set up. And while these investments in time and money continued to negatively affect our financial performance in Q2, the upside for the last half of the year could more than make up for any short-term drag. While Piccolo instrument sales and units were lower than expected in Q2, disc sales finished stronger than expected, mostly due to our efforts into selling into segments that see more sick patients. Another challenge was royalty income, and Q2 2012 was lower by about $343,000 compared to Q2 last year due to the patent dispute with Cepheid. Even with these challenges and distractions we had a record sales quarter with sales finishing at $40 million, up 13% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. International sales finished especially strong coming in at $8 million or 40% year-over-year and 28% quarter-over-quarter. European sales totaled $6.6 million, up 41% year-over-year and the Pac Rim at $1.4 million was up 35%. The second container for Europe we discussed in Q1 was shipped in September. Now in the future we will be shipping all of our orders destined for Europe from our warehouse located near Frankfurt, thus eliminating the lumpy ordering patterns we have experienced in the past. Our domestic sales in Q2 were also at record levels and totaled $32 million, up 8% year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Domestic vet sales were up 12% versus Q2 last year, finishing at $24.7 million, and more to follow from Marty in a few minutes. Sales to the government, while down 7% year-over-year, were up 11% quarter-over-quarter and finished at $1.2 million. Worldwide medical sales for Q2 totaled $7.3 million, up 7% versus Q2 last year and up 2% versus last quarter. Domestic medical sales were up 10% year-over-year but the medical sales to the international market were down 6% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter. More to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. Now for the quarter we sold 1,227 instruments, up about 24% year-over-year or about 239 instruments. Quarter-over-quarter instrument unit sales were up 21% or 210 units. In dollars, instrument sales totaled $8.8 million, up 15% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter. We sold 504 VetScans versus 383 Q2 last year and 367 last quarter. We also sold 262 hematology instruments versus 225 Q2 last year and 250 last quarter. And we sold 168 Piccolos, including 33 to the government, versus 198 Q2 last year and 172 last quarter. U.S. Piccolo sales, excluding the government sales, finished Q2 at 91 units versus 119 Q2 last year. And finally, we sold 293 i-STAT and coag instruments versus 182 last year and 228 last quarter. Now total disc sales at 1,760,000 units were up 16% compared to Q2 last year and up 11% over last quarter. In dollars, disc sales finished at a record $23 million, up 18% year-over-year and 10% quarter- over-quarter. Total vet disc sales at 1.2 million units were up 14% year-over-year and 13% quarter-over- quarter. And in dollars, vet disc sales finished at a record $17.6 million, up 18% year-over-year and 12% quarter-over-quarter. Now other vet consumable sales that include Rapid Tests, i-STAT cartridges and coag cartridges and hematology reagents finished Q2 at $6.7 million, up 12% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. Medical disc sales totaled 600,000 units, up 20% year-over-year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. In dollars, medical disc sales were up 17% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter. 18% of total sales were medical sales while 79% were vet sales and 3% other. This compares with 19%, 76%, 5% Q2 last year and 20%, 77%, 3% last quarter. 22% of sales were capital sales while 78% consumables. This compares with 22%, 78% Q2 last year and 21%, 79% last quarter. 20% of total sales were international while 80% were domestic. This compares with 16%, 84% Q2 last year and 17%, 83% last quarter. The disc average selling price finished Q2 at $12.94, up $0.20 year-over-year but down $0.07 quarter- over-quarter. Disc cost at $4.01 was down $0.06 year-over-year but up $0.03 quarter-over-quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase is mostly due to higher shipping costs and the set-up of our distribution facility in Germany. Disc gross margin finished at 69%, about the same as last quarter. Now even though we had a loss of $343,000 in royalty income and continued strong sales from lower-margin OEM products, we finished Q2 with a record gross profit of $22 million, up 11.5% year-over-year and 14.6% quarter-over-quarter. Gross margin for Q2 at 55% was up 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter but down about 100 basis points year-over-year. As we continue to focus on the 2x2 program and experience higher volumes of disc sales, we should see margins continue to expand. Now operating expenses, excluding the investment in our Reference Lab, finished at $15.7 million or 39.2% of sales, which is down from 40.6% of sales Q2 last year and 43% of sales last quarter. Legal expenses of about $600,000 due to the patent suit and the FTC issues discussed earlier were about $150,000 less than last quarter. Including the Reference Lab expenses, total expenses totaled $16.8 million or 42% of sales, down from 45% of sales last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses for Q2 2012 totaled $9.3 million or 23.3% of sales, down from 23.8% of sales Q2 last year and down from 25.4% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses for Q2 finished at $3 million or about 7.5% of sales, down from 9.3% of sales Q2 last year and 9.6% of sales last quarter. Admin expenses, excluding the investment in the new lab, of $3.4 million or 8.4% of sales is up from 7.5% of sales Q2 last year and up from 8% of sales last quarter. Now operating earnings finished at $5.2 million, down from $5.4 million or down about 3.9% versus Q2 last year, mostly due to higher expenses with the startup of AVRL and legal expenses discussed earlier. Operating earnings compared to last quarter, however, were up $2 million or 62% due to higher sales, improved gross margin and very good expense control. Net income of $3.3 million or $0.15 a share was down from $0.17 a share in 2Q last year but up from $0.10 last quarter. If you add back the $1.1 million invested in AVRL and the $600,000 in extra legal fees, our adjusted net income have been about $0.19 a share. In Q2, we bought back about 1.2 million shares of Abaxis stock for a total cost of about $27 million. We have an additional $13 million left in our authorized $40 million buyback. Now while we don’t provide guidance, we are positioned well for Q3 goals that include keeping our sales growth in double digits, along with scaling up our Reference Lab. We are focused on the 2x2 program in the factory and plan on completing the multi-cavity cover and barcode ring projects, which could take $0.20 out of the manufacturing cost of the disc when fully implemented. The two new Rapid Tests and hemoglobin development are close to completion, with the clinical trials in one of the Rapid Tests underway. Our focus on the significant Piccolo beta site testing is also a priority for Q3 and Q4, with the goal of helping our potential customer collect all the data they need to make point-of-care blood testing a success in that facility. Now Q3 is usually a strong instrument quarter, so we expect to see Piccolo instrument sales back to year-over-year volume growth. Now before I introduce Marty, I would like to let everybody know that I have some stock options that will be expiring in the next couple of years, and due to tax planning I may decide to sell some of these options. And if I do, I’ll need to exercise some of these options. And if I do, I’ll need to probably sell some stock to cover the cost of the option price and pay the taxes. So with that, Marty? Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Great. Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I will provide some additional detail pertaining to the North American Animal Health business and give an update on our new AVRL division. In our second quarter of fiscal year 2012, North American Animal Health contributed record revenues of $24.4 million, up 9% or over $2 million from our prior quarter and up 13% or $2.8 million from the same period last year. We shipped 836 instruments in Q2 versus 633 in the prior quarter and 594 a year ago. Instrument revenue in Q2 was a record $5.3 million versus $4.2 million in the prior quarter and $4.1 million a year ago. This is up 27% and 31% respectively. A couple of highlights in terms of instrument revenue. The chemistry instrument revenue was up 43% from the prior quarter. VSpro instrument revenue was 45% from the prior quarter and i-STAT instrument sales were up 28% from the prior quarter. In terms of units, we shipped a record 377 chemistry instruments, up 137 units or 57% from the prior quarter. We also shipped a record 126 i-STAT instruments, up 30 units or 31% from the prior quarter. We shipped 142 VSpro instruments, up 42% from the prior quarter. Consumable sales were also a record for North American Animal Health at $19.1 million. We had record revenue in our Rapid Test line at $2.1 million, up 46% from the prior quarter. We also had record revenue and record units sold in hematology reagents and VSpro cartridges. I attribute much of the growth to our investments in great people across the entire organization representing great products and services and with world-class customer support. For example, at the start of Q2 a year ago, we had a total of 57 individuals in the field, which has now grown to a total of 71 individuals throughout the U.S. and Canada. Now to Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories. After a controlled launch in September with some complementary work for the local marketplace, we launched nationwide October 1. Already today, we have over 400 customers signed up across 38 states. Inclusive of the September testing phase, AVRL has now received over 1,000 requisitions and has performed over 2,000 individual tests, panels or profiles. Feedback has been that the marketplace is impressed with the continued ability of Abaxis to exceed customer expectations, a goal we always try to achieve and a key element of our success. Additionally, our report formats are well received and our pricing programs are generating a lot of interest. I am also very pleased to report that the team built and launched the new Abaxis division from the ground up well under budget. So I want to once again thank and congratulate the North American Animal Health Organization, including our AVRL division in Olathe, Kansas, on a great second quarter fiscal year 2012. Mission accomplished. I look forward to reporting our Q3 results in January. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Marty. Okay. With that, Brenton, you're up. Brenton G. A. Hanlon Former Vice President of Medical Sales & Marketing for North America Thanks, Clint, and good afternoon, everyone. Rotor revenues were strong in Q2, finishing 20% higher than Q2 2011 and 8% above Q1 2012 levels. 20% increase in patients testing on the Piccolo suggest that our newer customers, those who purchased their instrument in the past 18 months, are testing more patients than our older customers. We believe a more selective approach to Piccolo placements combined with the new value proposition of real-time actionable information, patient convenience and patient practice efficiency is gaining traction and continues to move us in the direction of greater instrument utilization by physicians. Results from our most recent customer satisfaction survey also support our new product positioning and our new sales approach. 90% of respondents report that the Piccolo has increased their practice efficiency and 80% report that patient testing increases over time. Although the quality of new Piccolo placements continues to increase, the actual number of placements in Q2 was lower than expected. 91 instruments were shipped in Q2 compared to 104 in Q1 and 119 in Q2 2011. We attribute this in part to sales force adjustments in Q2, but primarily to the continued preoccupation with EMR system acquisition by both physician practices and IDNs. As you know, under the new healthcare plan both Medicare and Medicaid provide large financial incentives for practices that convert from paper to electronic recordkeeping and a financial disincentive for those which do not. Despite the lower-than-expected instrument revenues, overall U.S. medical Q2 sales increased 10% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Family practice with 34% of Piccolo placements and urgent care centers with 33% of placements continued to set the pace in Q2. We now have 770 instruments within family practice accounts and 517 within urgent care centers. It appears that the improved efficiency provided by the Piccolo is driving our growth in this sector because of the pressure on the limited primary care capacity within the U.S. Q3 is usually a strong instrument quarter due to the tax credits, so expect placements to pick up in Q3. With appropriate adjustments, we are staying the course with our strategy, which is focusing on patient convenience and practice efficiencies that accountable real-time information provides for independent physicians; expanding our presence in the IDN market; and working closely with those large organizations which are developing innovative approaches to the delivery of health care services. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Brenton. Okay. With those remarks out of the way, we are open to questions."

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the ABAXIS third quarter 2008 financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Dorame. Mr. Dorame, you may begin your conference. Joe Dorame Good afternoon.

At the conclusion of today's prepared remarks we will open the call for Q&A session. Before we begin we submit for the record the following statements. I would like to remind everyone this conference call includes statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

With that having being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ABAXIS. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you, Joe and good afternoon everybody. This afternoon I’ll review the accomplishments and the challenge for Q3 FY'08 and some of our some of our goals for Q4. After my short presentation, I will ask Martin Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing, and Chris Bernard our VP of North American, Medical Sales and Marketing to give an update on their respective business and then we will take questions. The challenges for Q3 mostly involved timing and mix. The biggest of these was the timing of getting the Japanese approval and license for our new distributor, because the final approval was not received last quarter, we were not able to ship product to our new distributor in Q3. This led to a 35% decrease in sales to the Pac Rim or about $351,000 fewer sales than Q3 of last year. With the approval we should be able to make this up over the next couple of quarters. The Japanese authorities have completed their inspection of our facility this month and we expect the license to be issued this quarter. Second, we sold fewer VetScan's Q3 '08 than Q3 '07 down about 37%. However, we sold more hematology instruments in Q3 '08 and Q3 '07 up 44%. The HM5 was just introduced in September and the rest we're still focused on the launch of this great new product. While the margin on the HM5 is less than the VS2's or VetScan's, because we buy them in euros margin on future hematology consumable reagents is in the 70% range. Piccolo disc sale units in Q3 were up about a 11% year-over-year in this seasonally slower quarter. But, that was after a Q2 increase of 43% year-over-year and 24% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the government, Piccolo disc sales were about 18% year-over-year for Q3 after increasing 54% year-over-year and 24% quarter-over-quarter in Q2. Even though, we had some timing and mix issues, we still posted record sales finishing at $25.7 million up 17% year-over-year and up 2% quarter over quarter. Piccolo instrument sales of 238 units were up 45% were 74 placements year-over-year and up 34% or 60 placements quarter-over-quarter. Clearly the CLIA-Waived status on electrolytes helped us achieve this quarter and that was definitely a benefit. Record medical sales of $6 million were 29% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter due to strong instruments sales in placements. Ex the government sales worldwide medical sales were 34% year-over- year. The strength on the vet side of the business was in disc sales, finishing over a $11 million up 30% year-over-year in this seasonally slower quarter. In units we sold 896,000 vet discs up a 175,000 units or up about 24% year-over-year, a mix of higher price disc lead to the higher $1 percentage growth. Changes in the domestic sales process started in Q1 ’08 with the focus on both consumables, as well as instruments appears to be working. Strong European sales of $3.4 million up 22% year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter kept the international sales growth in positive territory. Despite our inability to ship products to our new Japanese distributor international sales finished at $4.1 million up 7% year-over- year. We sold about 17 fuel instruments in Europe year-over-year. This was due to a very strong Q3 in ’07. At that time the shipments of Q2 '07 instruments were delayed until Q3 '07 due to the grey screen problems identified in Q2 '07. In Asia we shipped 45 fewer instruments due to the Japanese licensing issue discussed earlier. International sales made up about 16% of the total while domestic 84% this compares with 1783 Q3 last year and 1684 last quarter. North American sales of $21.628 million were up 19% year over year and 3% quarter-over-quarter despite the seasonally slower quarter for consumables. Government sales at $913,000 were up 5% year- over-year, but down 18% quarter-over-quarter. Government sales are generally stronger in Q2, because the end of their fiscal year. Total worldwide vet sales of $18 million up 11% year-over-year were impacted by slower international instrument sales, which were down 31% mostly due to fewer sales in the background. Total disc sales of $14.258 million were up 26% year-over-year with a total of 1.212 million units shipped in Q3 up 21% in units versus Q3 last year. The average selling price on the disc was 1176 up 4.3% or $0.50 year-over-year were down 10% quarter- over-quarter due to mix. The disc cost of $4.34 was down year-over-year by $0.03 and quarter-over- quarter down by $0.08. We sold a total of 880 instruments in Q3, up 14% quarter-over-quarter or 109 instruments, but down 32 instruments or 4% year-over-year mostly due to fewer instruments sold outside the US. In dollar total instruments sales of $8.4 million were flat year-over-year, but up 12% quarter- over-quarter. We sold 341 VetScans up 44 units from Q2 '08 but down 198 units from our record 539 VetScans in Q3 last year. The focus on hematology in the U.S and fewer international sales were the main reasons for the shortfall. We sold 301 hematology instruments versus 209 in Q3 last year, up 92 units or 44% and up units versus last quarters 296. As I mentioned before we sold 238 Piccolos, up 74 units from Q3 last year, years total of 164. Quarter-over-quarter, Piccolo instruments sales were up 60 units. And this is with one month of mostly CLIA-Waived test in the US. On the operation side of the business we made excellent progress in instrument manufacturing department. Because of the problems with the past four quarters we entered Q3 with a backlog of customer repairs, loan repairs and rework. In addition, operations had to meet the demand for 880 new units, up a 100 units quarter-over-quarter. We also had a goal of building additional inventory of new chemistry instruments to meet the anticipated demands of Q4. To address this challenge the team worked seven days a week and processed over 3000 instruments, and met the goals with higher quality units. Infant mortality problems continued to decline with the new processes in place, however overtime expenses did have a negative impact on the gross margins for Q3. On a side note, with the change in operations managements under the leadership of Don Wood, we have not only improved the throughput of instruments, improved the quality, but have also identified efficiency improvements and could lead to cost reductions in the million of dollars over the next 12 to 24 months. Capital sales made up 33% of the total for Q3 while consumables sales were 67%.This compares with 38.62, Q3 last year and 30.70 last quarter. Medical sales made up 23% of the total, vet 70% and 7% other. This compares with 2174 or 5 Q3 of last year and 22726 last quarter. Even though, instrument gross margins were negatively impacted by higher sales of hematology instruments, which are purchased with expensive euros and higher factory cost for chemistry instruments due to more overtime, we still finished Q3, with the second best gross profit ever at $13.6 million up 18% year-over-year and down only 2% quarter-over-quarter or 53% of sales up 4 basis points on the Q3 last year. Operating expenses of $9.3 million or 36% of sales were slightly down compared to Q3 '07 expenses up 36.6% of sales and down from last quarters expenses of 38.7% of sales. R&D expenses of $1,629,000 or 6.3% of sales were down from 7.2% sales in Q2 and down from 6.8% of sales in Q3 last year. Sales of marketing expenses of $656,000 or 23.6% of sales were also down quarter-over-quarter from 25.3% of sales and down compared to Q3 last years 24% of sales. Admin expenses of $1,571,000 or 6.1% sales were flat compared to last quarter, but up slightly compared to 5.7% of sales in Q3 last year. Operating income of $4,353,000 was our second best quarter ever finishing up 24% at 16.9% of sales compared to 16.3% of sales last quarter and 16% of Q3 last year sales. Operating earnings finished at about $0.19 per share versus 16 last year. Pre-tax earnings of $4,905,000 was up 22% year-over-year or about $0.22 of share versus $0.18 Q3 last year and $0.21 last quarter. Net income of $3,205,000 was up 15% year-over-year or about $0.14 a share versus $0.13 a share Q3 last year. The focus in R&D for Q3 was completing the last four CLIA waivers and the development of our heartworm test. Three of the four waivers were submitted in October and the last one [D-belly] will go in the week of February 11. The hospital that was doing the reference method testing on D-belly was slower than expected in completing this project. The heartworm project is in the final stages of completion and we’re working on the regulatory requirements in the process to get it cleared. Goals for Q4 include the expansion of our medical sales team in the US, developing a sales strategy for this new CLIA waived environment, scaling up additional vendors for chemistry instruments parts and continue to make progress in meeting our goal of $1 share an earning. Now before I introduce Chris and Marty I want to let everybody know that I have a 70,000 share option expiring in the next 11 months. So I may be selling some stock over the next three quarters as I deal with this. Now with that I'd like to introduce Chris Bernard, our VP of North America in Medical Sales and Marketing. Chris, you are on. Chris Bernard Thanks Clint. One of the record quarter on the medical side is quarterly US medical sales minus the military were up 25% of $4.2 million year-over-year and approximately 8% quarter-over-quarter. The medical disc sales minus military were about 235,000 of 18% year-over-year, slightly down quarter-over- quarter. In the US we had records across the country. We sold a 165 Piccolos and a total placement of 194 systems. The 194 systems surpass the previous record of a 114 placements, which took place this same quarter last year. Top segments for us again this quarter were [FPGP] at 81 placements, 39 imaging centers and 23 urgent cares. PSS led the distribution ranks with 84 placements fall closely by Henry Schein with 56 and through our strong continued internal marketing; we continue to close direct units at pace of 16 this past quarter. Our sales team took advantage of a perfect storm and outperformed in placement this quarter, averaging approximately 18 units per headcount, PSS [Lab Zone] and Henry Schein lab program were key store success in Q3, wave status sitting in mid November served as a powerful explanations point to the quarter, 108 of the 194 placements closed in December alone. Our sales force is two weeks away from the full 14 headcount. We will take that number to 15 this quarter and will further expand that number in FY ’09. We saw strong focus closes in the imaging arena through marketing efforts and distributed partnerships, our URL program is starting in October is 39 imaging closes are direct results of the segmentation marketing that we continue to perform. We will launch an urgent care program in the next week that will focus sales here in Q4 and in to Q1. It’s important to point out that our largest reagent trail segments continue to be hematology and oncology. We continue to focus this arena in conjunction with all the waived opportunities that have now become available. Oncology practices as a majority will remain moderately complex. Challenges in Q3 were few but worth mentioning. We continued our maze on some of the first generation Piccolo xpress has caused increased cost and time to do some reinstalls and slow the road of growth in those earlier accounts. Kernel reorganization is at the corporate level causes slowdown in the historical placement pattern that we've seen over the last four quarters. As Q3 is historically been one of our strongest capital quarters the performance of this quarter by sales force exceeded many expectations. While it is difficult to ascertain the long-term impact of [Wave] status the strength of the sales pipeline was revealed in -- certainly in the month of December. While the initial excitement and momentum continues into Q4, it is Abaxis significant challenges. As you may be aware FDA approval is half of the equation. In the words of a CMS regulator, Abaxis is in un-chartered waters with Wave, CNP, DNP and electrolyte panels. The process by which these new panels get loaded as wave in the CMSB Schedule is cumbersome at best. As this call takes place CMS is in the process of loading these codes, however the first available billable date for a Wave, CMP, DNP and Electrolyte panel will be April 1st of this year. Customers will have the ability to retroactively bill however for any test performed after January 16th, 2008. And we are in the process of communicating and educating our current, as well as prospective customers the logistics involves with this first of it's kind testing procedure. With that I'll toss it back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Okay, great. Thank you, Chris. Okay now, Marty, our VP in North America in Vet Sales and Marketing, you are on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. The US and Canada veterinary business contribute $14.7 million in revenue in Q3, up 15% or $1.9 million year-over-year and up 4% or $500,000 quarter-over-quarter. Rotor sales at $9.4 million were up 32% versus Q3 last year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Hematology reagent sales through quarter at $1 million were up 21% year-over-year and up 17% from the prior quarter. Instruments unit's sales were up 48 units quarter-over-quarter and down only 16 units year-over-year despite the changes in the sales and marketing focus from an instrument-only emphasis to an instrument and reagent sales emphasis. The launch of the HM5 and our sales in marketing efforts on this new product resulted in hematology unit sales up considerably 40% year-over-year. Moving forward, we are again emphasizing chemistry unit sales and early results was good. For example, the North American Veterinary conference just last week, the sales team working in that booth took orders for a record 32 instruments, 20% higher than the previous record for instruments sales at this or any conference. Of these, 15 or almost 50% were Abaxis VetScan VS2 instruments. Additionally, the refocus of the sales team to include day-to-days account managements and selling applications and increase utilization of errors, instruments are ready in place, has had impacted reagent sales and a strategy all in all appears to be working. We are beginning our Q4 with 41 field sales representatives and now 7 from 6 Area Sales Managers. This quarter the sales and marketing team is focused on completing the ramp up of the new hires that began their field work in Q3 and we will be doing no additional expansion for the balance of the fiscal year. But, we do plan additional expansion likely begin in Q1 and into Q2 FY '09. The North American Veterinary business unit besides heading two field sales managers, one promoted from within the sales organization and one recruited from outside the organization has filled as well a director level position charged with customer care, managing all aspect of customer satisfaction, retention and organic growth. We have also added a Director of Business development focused on both internal product development opportunities and external synergistic partnerships, in order to continue to strengthen our veterinary business and maintain, if not accelerate our growth. The infrastructure is in place and the organization is solid and we all look forward to a strong Q4 and FY '2009. And with that I will turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank, you Marty. So, now we're open for questions."

With that having been said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? <strong>Clinton Severson</strong> Thank you Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q3 FY ’09 and some of our goals for Q4 and then after my short presentation, I’ll ask Martin Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing, and Chris Bernard, our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing, to give an update on their respective businesses. We’ll then take questions. Now that we are dealing with a difficult operating environment, we had two significant challenges in Q3 that negatively affected our financial performance. The first was a one-time expense of about $500,000 for due diligence tied to a potential acquisition we eventually did not complete. The second was a vet disc order for about $900,000 that is shipped by container to one of our large European distributors expected in January but did not arrive until very early January. Now despite these challenges, we grew our business year-over-year by about 5%, finishing the quarter at 27 million. Chemistry instrument sales grew in both the vet and medical side. Total instruments shipped finished at 886 units, up six units versus a much better operating environment Q3 of last year. VetScan instrument sales for Q3 at 403 units were up 18%, or 62 instruments versus 341 sold in Q3 '08 and up 42 units over last quarter sales of 361. Piccolo instrument sales for Q3 totaled 242 units, a new record, but up only four units versus Q3 last year. Quarter-over-quarter Piccolo instrument sales were up 45% or 75 units. Hematology instrument sales at 241 units were up 17% or 35 instruments quarter-over-quarter, but down year-over-year by about 60 units. Total disc sales of $1.3 million units were up 7% year-over-year. Medical disc sales of 467,288 discs, also a new record, or up 48% versus Q3 last year. Quarter-over-quarter medical disc sales were up about 8%. Fewer business to the Vet for routine care and the delay in the European container, led to fewer disc sales in Q3, which finished at 832,663 units, down about 63,000 units, or about 7% compared to Q3 last year. In dollars, Vet disc sales finished of 11,340,000 and was flat versus Q3 last year. Total Vet sales of $18 million were flat year-over-year but medical sales of $7.2 million, or up 19% year-over-year and quarter- on-quarter. U.S. sales totaled $22.9 million, up about 6% while international sales finished at $4.1 million, up about 1% versus Q3 last year. European sales of $3 million were down a 11% mostly due to the delay in the German container, while Pac rim sales of $1.1 million were up 61% due to higher sales in Japan. Government sales of $1.2 million were up 32% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. With the management now focused on this large opportunity we should see continued growth here. Domestic sales made up 85% of the total sales while international sales made up 15%. This compares to 84:16 Q3, last year and 81:19 last quarter. Capital sales made up 30% of total sales while consumable sales made up 70%. This compares to 33:67 Q3, last year and 25:75 last quarter. Medical sales were 27% of total sales Vet sales 66% and others 7%. This compares to 23:77 Q3, last year and 22:72:6 last quarter. Disc average selling price at $11.97 was up $0.21 versus the same period last year, while costs were down $0.27, a new record low of $4.07. Gross margins on discs finished at 66% about the same as last quarter, but up 300 basis points versus Q3 last year. Improvements in the factory led to total gross margin increasing 300 basis points, finishing at 56% versus 53% last year. Quarter-over-quarter gross margins improved 100 basis points. Total gross profit of $15.1 million, was up a 11% year-over-year and down slightly above 1% quarter- over-quarter due to the mix of higher instrument sales in Q3. On the operating side, as I mentioned before, we spent an additional $500,000 for due diligence on an acquisition we never completed, so our admin expenses were higher than normal finishing at $2.2 million, or 8.3% of sales. This compares to 6.1% of sales Q3 last year and 7% of sales last quarter. Total operating expenses of $10.3 million, or 38% of sales were up from 36% of sales Q3 last year and flat over last quarter. R&D expenses of $2 million, or 7.6% of sales were up from 6.3% of sales year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Sales and marketing expenses at $6.1 million, or 22.5% of sales were down over Q3 last year’s 23.6% of sales and Q2 '09 of 23.5% of sales. Good expense control and higher gross margins led to a 9% increase in operating earnings year-over-year, which finished at $4.8 million or about 18% of sales. Excluding the one-time 500,000 in due diligence expenses, operating income would have been up 21%. Net earnings of $3.4 million, or $0.15 a share, were up one penny versus Q3 last year. Excluding the one- time $500,000 in due diligence expenses, net earnings would have been about $0.17 a share. Other highlights for Q3 of ’09 includes securing the IP for the lateral flow technology and launching our rapid canine hormone test. In addition we made a deal with SMB a Danish company on a new coag instrument that was well received at the NAB seashore earlier this month. From the R&D side of the business we’ve received CLIA waivers for phosphorus and CK, which went into our renal and cardiovascular panel, the MetLyte 8. The goal is to DBIL and magnesium recalibrated this quarter and submitted in late March or early April. Our C-reactive protein test is in clinical trials in MI University and when completed we will submit the 510(k). Our heartworm on the rotors in clinical trials at three sites and also should be completed in about 30 days. Once this is done they will be submitted to the USDA. So, with that I will turn the call over to Martin. Martin? <strong>Martin Mulroy</strong> Thanks Clint. Good afternoon everybody. In North American Veterinary business was up only 2% year- over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter still contributed record revenue of $15.1 million in Q3 FY '09. Year-over-year sales in units of chemistry instruments were up 13% having sold 285 instruments in Q3 '09 versus 252 units in Q3 '08. Chemistry instrument revenue was up 16% year-over-year, quarter-over- quarter chemistry instruments were up 7% in units and the associated revenue up 6%. Hematology instruments were considerably down both in units and revenues year-over-year, 20% and 24% respectively, was up quarter-over-quarter 23% units and 19% in revenue. Our consumable business was down 3% quarter-over-quarter, was up 6% year-over-year, our direct consumable business that is our research business, national accounts and areas to which we have no or very limited distribution, last quarter generated $2.5 million in revenue, up 17% quarter-over-quarter and is up 109% year-over-year. At the North American Veterinary Conference last week we launched two new products as Clint mentioned. They are VetScan Canine Heartworm Rapid Diagnostic Test, which we anticipate to be the first in a full line of lateral flow test for infectious diseases. And the VetScan Vspro, an instrument for measuring coagulation parameters in-clinic and in minutes. The rapid assay we are shipping now and the coagulation instrument we are taking orders for and we anticipate shipping in six to eight weeks. While registration slips show we understand it’s down 12% and the traffic in the exhibit areas was in my opinion down considerably more. Both new products were very well received and garnered a lot of attention for the practice owners in attendance. Also in January, we held our National Sales Meeting where we intensely trained our teams on the new products and using our core economic strengths across the entire product portfolio to our advantage. So, a key goal in the current quarter is same as it was for last quarter. Continued emphasis and focus by our marketing team and sales force on the economic advantages and efficiencies provided by the Abaxis laboratory relative to any alterative. The operating costs of the Abaxis VetScan instruments are significantly lower in competition and clearly more efficient than using a commercial lab. While our Canine Heartworm Test is aggressively priced to take market share fast. And with that I will turn it back over to Clint. <strong>Clinton Severson</strong> Great, thank you Martin. Next Chris Bernard. Chris. <strong>Christopher Bernard</strong> Thanks. Good afternoon folks. U.S. medical sales minus the military were up 10% at $4.66 million year- over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. U.S. medical disc sales minus the military were up 51% at 357,000 versus 235,000 a year ago, and flat quarter-over-quarter. In this economy of declining workforce and office business, we continue to focus on treatment centers paid dividends this past quarter. We closed 47 Piccolo's at Urgent Care walk-in clinics and added 15 oncology centers to the customer list. This compares to only 18 total placements in the FP/GP internal medicine arena. The average daily rotor usage amongst all customers remained steady at 5.2 panels per day. In the U.S., we sold a 136 Piccolo's at total placement of a 144 sets with pistons but the selectiveness of the capital spending at the office level, we continue to explore alternative acquisition programs for the offices while maintaining our capital revenue growth. This past Q3 historically a very strong capital quarter, so a slow down primarily attributed to software labs on this year from PSM. Top rep sold 15, 14 and 13 units respectively. We currently have 14 and 15 territories are currently filled. The lab for evaluations concluded near the end of Q3. We will be meeting with them in the coming weeks to discuss next steps. In the health-screening sector we've commitments from industrial pilots, two large health-screening organizations, also evaluation of two occupational screening sites. Our goal is to conclude all of these pilots and evaluations by the end of the Q4. Marketing strategies for Q4 includes, by the end of Q4 we would have touched via marketing all the pertinent officers from the national CLIA list, selling in the neighborhood of 170,000 sites. We'll continue to target all levels of treatment centers, oncology, urgent care, cardiology and pediatric. Overall we will turn off our direct marketing efforts two fold in an effort to identify physicians in our offices, who’re still looking to purchase in the near-term. Lastly, we've completed materials for full educational campaign aimed at occupational health-screening companies, employers and employees. Initial feedback has been very positive from the screeners. Q4 will be transitional quarter for us, as we compete for the reduced capital spending dollars with other manufacturers. The key will be our ability to customize pricing and programs that mitigate the risk and commitment concerns that are increasing at the office level. Sales force has been given a clear direction and now will provide flexibility solutions to new prospects of the circle back to the accounts that have been on the sideline waiting for the economy to change. With that I'll pass it back to Clint. <strong>Clinton Severson</strong> Great, and thank you Chris. With those comments concluded we are open for questions."

Thank you, Joe and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q3 FY 2010, some of the goals for Q4 and then after my short presentation, I will ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing to give an update on their respective businesses. We'll then take questions. While Q3 FY 2010 was another record, but we did have some short-term issues. First, let's talk about the Medical business. While it finished down year-over-year by about $2 million most of that was a result of lower instrument shipments to the government and the domestic medical market. While we had record domestic instrument placements, a larger chunk of these units were shipped from our distributor's warehouses. More to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. Government medical sales of about $400,000 were down about $700,000 or 64% year-over-year and down about 49% quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to instrument sales. Medical disc sales of just under 400,000 units were down about 81,000 units versus Q3 last year, 33,000 of those units were from Europe that were sold in Afghanistan and Libya Q3 last year but did not materialize Q3 this year. And 49,000 fewer units shipped from the U.S. due to distributor orders moving from late December to early January. As we compare non-military Piccolo instrument sales shipped from Abaxis over the last four quarters. The result are as follows: Q4 '09, 82; Q1 2010, 88; Q2 2010, 116; and Q3 2010, 130. So far the strategy on the Medical side looks like it's working. On the Vet side, disc sales increased about 57,000 units to finish it just under 900,000 units, even though we had two domestic distributors moved from quarterly shipments to monthly shipments. More to follow from Marty shortly. Even with this movement of sales from one quarter to the next, we finished the quarter with total sales of $31 million, up 15% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter, a new record. Even though we had fewer Piccolo instrument sales, total instrument sales also finished at an all-time record of 1,212 units, up 326 units or 37% year-over-year and up 286 units or 31% quarter-over-quarter. We sold 572 VetScan, also a new record versus 403 Q3 last year and 363 last quarter. We sold 256 hematology instruments versus 241 Q3 last year and 210 last quarter. And then of course, 134 Piccolos versus 242 last year and 143 last quarter. And 250 coag (coagulation) and i-STAT units versus 210 last quarter. While this sales were in a seasonal slow time, we finished the quarter with just under 1.3 million units at $16,300,000, up 5% year-over-year but down about 11% quarter-over-quarter. While our total medical sales for the quarter were down $2 million year-over-year, total Vet sales were up $6 million or up a remarkable 33% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter, finishing at $23.9 million. Record international sales for Q3 2010 totaled $6.1 million, up 48% year-over-year and 11% quarter- over-quarter. Europe, with record Q3 sales of $4.9 million was up 60% year-over-year and 9% quarter- over-quarter. Pac Rim sales of $1.2 million for Q3 were up 16% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over- quarter. Total North American sales of $25 million were up 9% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over- quarter. Total government sales for Q3 2010 totaled $473,000, down about 61% year-over-year and down about 53% quarter-over-quarter. Sales to the government are not predictable but we have had very strong quarters after we've launched. 27% of sales for the quarter were capital sales while 73% were consumable and this compares with 30%, 70% Q3 last year and 22%, 78% last quarter. 20% of total sales for the quarter were international sales while 80% were domestic. This compares with 15%, 85% Q3 last year and 18%, 82% last quarter. 17% of Q3 sales were Medical sales, 77% were Vet sales and 6% other. This compares with 27%, 66%, 7% Q3 last year; and 21%, 72%, 7% last quarter. The disc average selling price finished at a record $12.75, up $0.78 year-over-year and $0.28 quarter- over-quarter. Disc cost at $4.09 were down $0.17 year-over-year but up $0.05 quarter-over-quarter due to slightly lower unit volumes mostly due to the timing of distributor orders. Gross margin on discs finished at 68%, up 346 basis points year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Total gross margin at 59% was up 300 basis points versus Q3 last year and led to record gross profit of $18.3 million, up 21% year-over-year and 2.5% quarter-over-quarter. Total operating expenses of $12.9 million, including a non-cash compensation charge of about $1,448,000, about $1 million higher than the charge Q3 last year and they finished at 41.5% of sales, slightly lower than the 42.5% of sales last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses at about $7.5 million including the charge or about 24% of sales were higher than the 22.5% of sales Q3 last year but slightly less than the 25.1% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses at $2.8 million including the charge, or about 9% of sales were up from 7.6% of sales Q3 last year and up from 8.6% of sales last quarter. Admin expenses of $2.6 million including the charge were 8.2% of sales and were flat year-over-year and down versus last quarter's 8.9% of sales. Higher sales and improvements in gross margin led to higher operating income which finished at $5,423,000, up 14% versus Q3 last year or 17.5% of sales. Quarter-over-quarter operating income was up 9%. Without the non-cash charge, operating income would have finished up 31% year-over-year and about 22% of sales. Net income totaled $3,430,000, up 2% versus Q3 last year or about $0.15 a share. Without the non-cash comp charge, net income would have finished at $0.19 a share. On the R&D side of the business, we continue to optimize the scale of our Heartworm on the rotor product and we completed the expanded studies, submitted the data and received FDA clearance on our CRP test. We are focusing on the development of more rapid tests as well as adding hemoglobin on the rotor. Our two-by-two project continues with progress made on process improvements that led to the 300 basis point increase in gross margin realized this quarter as compared to Q3 of last year and with increased volumes, these improvements should continue. Q4 goals include aggressive sales targets for all markets especially the Medical business, as we validate this new sales and marketing strategy. Also, making sure all of our Abaxis IDEXX customers are fully informed on how to order consumables and have an opportunity to purchase other Abaxis instruments. We want to keep the focus on instrument sales in the Vet market by promoting our new Heartworm on the rotor and we will continue to put a priority on the two-by-two project, as well as expanding our rapid test menu. As I have mentioned over the past few quarters, I exercised the 70,000 share stock option that was close to expiring in October of '08. And because the price of Abaxis stock was still unattractive, I borrowed the cash from a bank to exercise this option to pay the taxes. Because of this obligation, I may sell some Abaxis stock over the next few months to pay back the bank. With that out of the way, Marty, you're up. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon, everybody. In my prepared remarks, I will break out a few numbers for the North American Animal Health business, and I'll speak further to the December 17, 2009 press release announcing our entry into production animal diagnostics. The North American Animal Health Organization generated record revenues of over $18.8 million for the third quarter of our fiscal year, up 25% or $3.7 million year-over-year, and up 10% or $1.8 million in the record revenue reported last quarter. Fiscal year-to-date, Animal Health recorded revenues of $53 million, up 23% or almost $10 million versus the same period last year. Instrument revenue was up 52% quarter-over-quarter and up 30% year-over-year. Our reputation for innovation, quality, reliability, service and support along with we think, simply better instruments, coupled with effective marketing and sales execution resulted in our shipping in the quarter a record 842 instruments. Recurring revenue from the continuous instrument sales focus and effort we expect will drive sustainable long-term growth. In fact, consumer revenue was up 23% from a year ago. With the Q3 intense instrument sales focus along with some other factors, consumer revenue was flat compared to last quarter's record consumable revenue. A couple of comments regarding the announcement of Abaxis Animal Health entering the production animal diagnostics business. Abaxis had a very strong presence in the animal diagnostics market. 23% of veterinary practices in North America have now integrated an Abaxis chemistry analyzer. Across our entire product portfolio, we are now doing business with almost one-third of the veterinary practices in the U.S. and Canada. We have a significant market share in the companion animal market. We are very strong in the exotic animal market. We have market share in the very difficult to reach equine market segment, and significant inroads have been made in the even harder to reach research and laboratory animal science market. Abaxis now is the second-largest and fastest-growing animal health Point-Of-Care of laboratory diagnostics company in the world. Given our continued success in the companion animal market segment, exotic animals, equine, laboratory animals and research markets, we believe our existing product portfolio has opportunities in production animal diagnostics as well. We have technology and product advantages that make Abaxis a natural fit in this arena. We also have very strong strategic relationships. We have solid partners here where we can capitalize on certain synergies that already exist. Now the rapid avian influenza antigen test announced last month is our entry into the growing production animal diagnostics marketplace, a market we estimate at $250 million in global sales. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you, Marty. Brenton, you're on. Brenton G. A. Hanlon Former Vice President of Medical Sales & Marketing for North America Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon, everyone. When I joined Abaxis a little less than five months ago, we began to focus on three priorities. Priority one was to stabilize the sales organization. So I'm pleased to report that we have not lost any sales people during the past five months. Also, the new people who have recently joined our sales team are doing very well. In fact, six of our top 10 performers in Q3 have been with Abaxis for less than 12 months. And our overall productivity per salesperson improved 84% in Q3 compared to Q2 and was more than double the productivity of Q1. Priority number two was to simplify and rationalize our sales channel. To this end we have narrowed our distribution focus to the three major national distributors: McKesson, Henry Schein and PSS. As we expected, eliminating several distributors require a rebalancing of the inventories and our sales channel. Something which impacted rotor sales in Q3. This is a one-time adjustment and all the sales growth has resumed in January. Priority three was to expand our customer base as quickly as possible. If you recall in Q1, we placed 86 Piccolos and in Q2 we placed 114. So I'm pleased to report that in Q3 we placed a record 193 Piccolos. 32 of the Piccolos were placed in Q3 via a reagent rental agreement with a wellness screening company. This company began operating with 18 Piccolos, which they quickly increased to 32. And due to continued strong demand, just this week the company added an additional 10 Piccolos to bring their total to 42. Incidentally, this week we also closed a 12-center urgent care chain in Texas. Of the 193 Piccolos we placed in Q3, 71 generated revenues for Abaxis and 87 came from distributor inventories. Clearing the distributor shelves had the effect of depressing Piccolo revenues in Q3. However, now that the channel has been cleared, going forward, all Piccolo placements will generate realtime revenues for Abaxis. The breakdown by segment for Piccolo placements in Q3 was: Urgent care centers, 21%; family practice, 17%; wellness clinics, 16%; internal medicine, 14%; oncology centers, 9%; and other, 23%. Looking forward to Q4, our focus is to one, launch an ambitious program to further expand our customer base and further enhance the productivity of our sales people. Number two, continue our very aggressive sales training program and three, to continue to work with our national accounts with the goal of closing one large account each quarter. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you, Brenton. With that, we'll open the call for questions."

With that having been said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Okay, thank you Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q3, 2011, some of the goals for Q4 and then after my short presentation I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Brenton our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing to give an update on their respective businesses. We’ll then take questions. Now challenges in Q3 centered in two areas, one was in the factory where we had problems with some plastic disc bases that were too brittle and caused scrap, zap some of our productivity gains and drove up some of our costs. The other was sales in Europe which were down both quarter-over-quarter and year- over-year mostly due to economic issues in Southern Europe and the UK. We believe the plastic issues will be resolved in the next few months and our marketing and sales efforts in Europe are going to be refocussed in the areas where the economies are stronger. Even though we had these challenges, we set another quarterly sales record finishing Q3 at just under $36 million up 16% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. The star of the quarter was the medical group where sales finished at a record $8.1 million up 57% year- over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter. Very strong government sales of $1.7 million were up triple digits or 261% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, which contributed partially to the success of the Medical segment with an order for 24 Piccolos from the Navy. Randy Knick, our Government Sales and Marketing has been working on this and other segments in the government over the last two years and has now seen some of those successes. Now, excluding the government sales total medical sales were up 36% year-over-year and up 9% quarter- over-quarter. More to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. That team continued its strong performance with total vet sales coming in at $26.3 million up 10% year-over-year, but flat quarter-over-quarter. Domestic vet sales finished at $21.5 million up 14% year-over-year or about the same as last quarter. More to follow from Marty in a few minutes. North American or domestic sales at $30.1 million for Q3 set another record and were up 21% year-over- year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Total international sales for the quarter of $5.8 million were down 4% year-over-year due to lower sales in Europe, which finished at $4.5 million down about 7% versus the same period last year. Quarter-over-quarter international sales were up 2% due to strong sales in the Pac- Rim, which finished at $1.3 million up 7% year-over-year and 27% quarter-over-quarter. We had record instrument sales in Q3 finishing with a total sales of 1261 instruments up 4% year-over- year or 49 instruments and up 28% quarter-over-quarter or 273 instruments. In dollars, total instrument sales were up 10% year-over-year finishing at $9.3 million. Quarter-over-quarter instrument sales finished up about $1.6 million or up 22%. We sold 433 VetScans versus 572 Q3 last year and 383 last quarter, 303 hematology instruments versus 256 Q3 last year and 225 last quarter, 235 Piccolos that included 59 sold to the government versus 134 Q3 last year and 198 last quarter. For those of you that are following the run rate of non-government Piccolo instrument sales since we changed our strategy, here it is, Q4 ‘09 82, Q1 ‘10 88, Q2 ‘10 116; Q3 ‘10 130, Q4 ‘10 144, Q1 ‘11 147, Q2 ‘11 172, Q3 ‘11 176. Again more to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. And finally 290 i-STAT and COAG instruments versus 250 Q3 last year and 182 last quarter. Total disc sales of 1,549,000 units were up 21% year-over-year in units and 20% in dollars. Vet disc sales at 975 units were up 10% in units and 12% in dollars. Medical disc sales at 575,000 units were up 49% in units and 50% in dollars. Other vet consumable sales that include heartworm, i-STAT, and COAG cartridges as well as hematology reagents finished Q3 at $5 million up 31% year-over-year and down about 16% quarter-over-quarter. North American sales made up 84% of total sales for Q3 while international sales made up 16%. This compares with 80, 20 Q3 last year and 84, 16 last quarter. 26% of total sales were capital sales while 74% were consumable. This compares with 27, 73 Q3 last year and 22, 78 last quarter. 23% of sales were medical sales and vet sales were 73%, and 4% other. This compares with 17, 77, 6, Q3 last year and 19, 76, 5 last quarter. The disc average selling price finished Q3 at $12.57 down about $0.18 versus Q3 last year and down about $0.17 versus last quarter. The reason for this decline is the mix. Disc cost at $4.14 was up 5% year- over-year and $0.07 quarter-over-quarter mostly due to plastic issues that I mentioned earlier in the call. While gross profit was up 8% year-over-year and about the same quarter-over-quarter, gross margin for Q3 finished at 55.2%, down 3.8 percentage points year-over-year and 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter. Plastic based issues in the factory and lower average selling price on disc due to the mix along with investments we are making in the 2x2 program were the main reasons. As we get closer to completing more of our efficiency projects should see the disc go below $4. Operating expenses for Q3 finished at 38.9% of sales an improvement over the 41.5% of sales Q3 last year and 40.7% of sales last quarter, which is mostly due to lower bonuses as a result of lower international sales and lower gross margins. Sales and marketing expenses at 8.2 million or 22.9% of sales were down versus Q3 last year’s 24.1% of sales and last quarter's 23.8% of sales. R&D expenses at 2.9 million or 8.2% of sales were down from 9.1% of sales Q3 last year and down from 9.3% of sales last quarter. Administration expenses at $2.8 million or 7.9% of sales were down from Q3 last year’s 8.2% of sales, but up from last quarter 7.5% of sales mostly due to higher legal costs. We believe legal costs will trend higher with the Cepheid patent litigation and the legal cost associated to complying with the subpoena for documents from the FTC related to an investigation of a competitor. Operating income finished at $5.8 million up 7.6% year-over-year and 8.2% quarter-over-quarter and net income at $3,835,000 or $0.17 per share was up 12% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. On the R&D side of the business, we finished the development in the clearance for our rapid parvovirus test and expect Giardia to be approved any day. The two other rapid tests under development missed our year end calendar goal, but could be completed by the end of this quarter. The hemoglobin on the disc test development is mostly completed and is in the manufacturing development stage, as this product requires a different manufacturing process. On the business development side, as you’ve probably already heard, I’m happy to report that we have reached an agreement with K-State University of Vet School to form a strategic partnership and launch the Abaxis Veterinary Reference Lab. This has been on the process for about 20 months and we’ll start organizing operations in late February or early March. The start up will take about six months with an investment of about $3 million from Abaxis. The operating losses from the lab over the six months startup period will total somewhere between 800,000 and $1.2 million. Once we have the lab in operation we can expect breakeven in about three quarters. Goals for Q4 include clearly getting the lab operations going, maintaining our strong sales momentum especially in the medical market. Completing the development of the next two rapid test and are slightly behind schedule. Continue to reduce expenses as a percent of sales and continue to meet the objectives of the 2x2 project. So with that, Marty you’re on. Marty Mulroy Great, thank you Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I will report some additional details regarding the North American Animal Health business. On third quarter of fiscal year 2011 North American Animal Health generated revenues of $21.5 million. While flat quarter-over-quarter, the business grew 14% year-over-year or $2.7 million. The year-over-year increase is led by (inaudible) of $1.5 million or 16% while our hematology reagent revenue was up $700,000, an increase of 74% compared to same period last year. We boarded 267 new customers this quarter accounting for 67% of its total transaction at the clinic level. These new customers purchased on average few Abaxis instruments. In aggregate, we hit a record 865 instruments this past quarter. At American Association of Equine Practitioners Meeting December 5th, we launched third fully automated quantitative equine fibrinogen test, running on Abaxis VetScan VSpro and it is a rapid and reliable assay that can be performed in the clinic or patient side or in the field. While providing the updated software and our shipping of the fibrinogen cartridges did not start till late December, we already have about 50 equine and mid dental practices having purchased an Abaxis VSpro for fibrinogen testing. At North American Veterinary Conference January 15, we announced our new K9 parvovirus, viral flow rapid test. Parvovirus a potentially life threatening disease in dogs is approximately a $6 million market in the U.S. We anticipate (inaudible) of the product in about four weeks. Additionally, we plan on announcing our Giardia rapid test at Western States Veterinary Conference on February 21st. Giardia is a parasitic infection which is an estimated $4 million U.S. market. This new product we anticipate shipping in March. I like to once again thank and congratulate the North American Animal Health Group and the entire Abaxis organization for a job well done. It was a productive quarter in terms of instruments placements, revenue, and expense management. The team is excited about the current quarter with the parvo and Giardia test launches in the companion animal market and our fibrinogen test continuing to build momentum in the equine and mixed animal marketplace. Our first commercial lab facility, as Clint mentioned will be operational in about six months with promotions begin in three months. We have a lot to do. Once operational, it will allow for Abaxis to become a sole provider for veterinary clinic laboratory needs, providing routine test in critical care and in emergency medicine laboratory needs, active points of care, and providing for the balance of the clinic laboratory testing requirements through our reference lab, the quality results, rapid turnaround time and extensive professional complicative[phonetic] support. With that, I’ll turn it back to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you Marty. Okay, now from the medical team, Brenton you are next. Brenton Hanlon Thanks, Clint and good afternoon everyone. In Q3 2011 the U.S. medical team continued to expand our position off a flat customer base adding 145 new feel well customers. And revenues from instrument sales increased 60% over Q3 2010 for a total of $1.2 million. Our sales to the urgent care sector continued to be strong and represented 23% of new customers added in Q3. Family practice sales were also strong in Q3 representing 26% of new customers and internal medicine accounted for 12% of new customers. Several of our larger medical systems accounts continued to add Piccolos in Q3. For example, an urgent care chain increased their number of Piccolos to 37. This customer plans to open 50 more clinics in calendar year 2011. The Concierge Medical chain increased in number to 41 and mobile (inaudible) screening company increased their number of Piccolos to 53. In Q3, we closed three new medical systems accounts, the second Concierge Medical chain, the Concierge employee wellness company and our third urgent care chain. At this point the numbers of these new customers are still small, but if these accounts follow the typical pattern, over time we expect to see a steady growth in new business. On the consumable side of the business, Q3 revenues were $3.8 million, an increase of 43% compared to Q3 2010 and 15% higher than Q2 2011. This increase indicates we are beginning to enjoy the benefits of our expanded customer base. So despite the confusion and uncertainty in the healthcare market, our overall sales grew 45% year- over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Our sales team is expanding both skills and knowledge as we continue to invest heavily in their development. And as a result, the productivity keeps increasing each quarter. Going forward, we plan to focus on those elements of our strategy that are yielding the best results in the PLL segment and continue to expand our presence within the large medical system segment. Back to you Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you very much Brenton. Now we’ll open for questions."

Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q3 FY 2012 and then some of the goals for Q4. After my short presentation, I will ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing to give an update on their respective businesses, we will then have time to take questions. Now the operating challenges in Q3 were Europe and government sales along with a decrease in royalty income of $317,000. In Q3, we completed the setup of our distribution warehouse in Germany to more efficiently and cost-effectively serve our customers and distributors. Because we can now ship any Abaxis products in Europe within 24 hours, our distributors needed to carry less inventory. This one-time adjustment especially with our German distributor resulted in a decrease of Vet consumable sales of about $818,000 compared to Q3 last year. While we believe this will normalize in Q4, the business environment in Europe, especially southern Europe is definitely more challenging. Total sales in Europe finished Q3 at $4.5 million, flat over Q3 last year. Medical sales in Europe however finished at a record $1.6 million, up 44% year-over-year and 63% quarter-over-quarter. As all of you know the U.S. has withdrawn the troops from Iraq, which impacted our government sales to the tune of about $933,000 versus Q3 last year. For the quarter, government sales totaled $772,000, down from $1.7 million in Q3 of last year. While we are working on adding Piccolos to VA clinics, prisons and other government installations, we believe sales to the government will be close to this level for the next couple of quarters. We continue to focus significant resources on our 4 projects, as well our distracting short term could produce positive results longer term. AVRL was launched nationally in Q3 which Marty will review shortly and we incurred about $640,000 of legal expenses in Q3 associated with the Cepheid lawsuit in the FTC investigation of a competitor. The big Piccolo opportunity is still in the works and Brenton will cover our progress in a few minutes. Even with these challenges and distractions, we grew the business finishing Q3 with sales of $37.9 million up 5% year-over-year but down about 5% quarter-over-quarter. Domestic sales, excluding government sales totaled $31.1 million up 10% over Q3 last year. Worldwide medical sales finished at a record level, even though medical sales to the government were down almost $1 million to finish at $8.1 million up about $21,000 year-over-year and up $814,000 or 11% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding the government sales, worldwide medical sales were up $978,000. Domestic medical sales were also at record levels finishing at $5.7 million up 10% year-over-year, up 11% quarter-over-quarter and more to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. Worldwide Vet sales for Q3 totaled $28.5 million up 8% versus Q3 last year with North American Vet sales up 11% versus Q3 last year, finished the quarter at $24.2 million. More from Marty in a few minutes. Pac- Rim sales totaled $1.5 million for Q3 up 12% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. Total discs or rotor sales, even with the lower performance from Europe and the government, finished at 1.6 million units, up 5% versus Q3 last year. Piccolo disc sales, despite the government being down 23,000 units, finished at a record 655,000 units, up 14% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter. Total Vet disc or rotor sales at 966,000 units were negatively impacted by Europe and finished down 1% in units but in dollars they were up 3%. North American Vet disc sales at $12.7 million were up a strong 12%. Other Vet consumable revenues that include i-STAT and coag cartridges, Heartworm and hematology reagent packs, finished Q3 2012 at $6.4 million up 28% versus Q3 last year. Total instrument sales of 1195 units were down about 66 units when compared to Q3 last year but the AFPs were up about $200 or 3%. We sold 438 VetScans versus 433 in Q3 last year and 504 last quarter. We sold 245 hematology instruments versus 303 in Q3 last year and 262 last quarter. We sold 226 Piccolos that included 26 sold to the government versus 235 in Q3 last year and 168 last quarter. U.S. Piccolo sales excluding the government finished Q3 at a 133 units versus 117 last year. And finally, we sold 286 i-STAT and coag [coagulation] instruments versus 290 last year and 293 last quarter. 22% of sales were medical sales while 75% Vet and 3% other. This compares with 23/73 for Q3 last year and 18/79 3 last quarter. 24% of total sales were capital, while 76% were consumables, this compares with 26-74 last year and 22-78 last quarter. 16% of sales were international sales while 84% were domestic and that compares with 16%-84% Q3 last year and 20%-80% last quarter. Disc or rotor average selling price finished Q3 at $12.56, down about $0.01 versus Q3 last year and down about $0.38 versus last quarter. The reason for the decline was the mix. The good news is disc cost hit a record low, finishing at $3.72 down $0.42 year-over-year and $0.29 quarter-over-quarter. This takes our gross margin for disc to an all-time record of 70%. While some of this improvement can be attributed to reduced incentive compensation, process improvement side to the two-by-two program clearly made a difference. We have the [indiscernible] good position for a disc cost to be consistently below $4 next year. Gross margin was negatively affected by the launch of AVRL. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health I apologize for interrupting, but you broke up there just a couple of sentences ago. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Okay, so I’ll restart. Okay so we’ll start with the disc average selling price here at $12.56, down about $0.01 versus Q3 last year and down about $0.38 versus last quarter, the reason for the decline was the mix. The good news though is disc cost hit a record low finishing at $3.72, down $0.42 year-over-year and down $0.29 quarter-over-quarter. This takes our gross margin for discs or rotors to an all-time record of 70%. While some of this improvement can be attributed to reduced incentive compensation, process improvements tied to the two- by-two program have clearly made the difference. We have the 8 cavity cover and barcode ring being cut in this quarter so we should be in a good position for disc cost to be consistently below $4. Gross margin was negatively affected by the launch of AVRL and the loss of $317,000 of royalty income along with continued strong sales growth of lower margin OEM products. Gross margin, excluding the effect of AVRL finished up 20 basis points to 55.4%. but with the cost of AVRL, gross margin declined 110 basis points compared to Q3 last year to finish at 54.1%. Quarter-over-quarter margins were up 40 basis points without AVRL or down about 90 basis points with the lab expenses included. With disc gross margins increasing, lab revenues growing along with some recovery of our Vet disc revenues in Europe, next quarter we should see improvements in gross margins going forward. Operating expenses excluding the investment in AVRL finished at $15 million or 39.5% of sales which is up from 38.9% of sales in Q3 last year and up from 39.2% of sales last quarter. Including the expenses for AVRL, operating expenses finished at 42% of sales, about the same as last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses excluding the expenses tied to AVRL totaled $9 million or 24% of sales which is up from 22.9% of sales Q3 last year and 23.3% of sales last quarter. Including the AVRL expenses, sales and marketing expenses were $9.9 million or 26% of sales. R&D expenses of $2.6 million or 7% of sales were down from 8.2% of sales Q3 last year and down from 7.5% of sales last quarter. Admin expenses including $640,000 of legal expenses, totaled $3.3 million or 8.7% of sales and were up from 7.9% of sales Q3 last year but down from 11% of sales last quarter. Legal expenses and AVRL operating cost negatively affected operating earnings which totaled $4.6 million, down 21% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. Operating income, excluding the legal and AVRL cost would have finished at $6.7 million, up 14% versus Q3 last year. Net income at $2.9 million was down 26% versus Q3 last year and down 14% versus last quarter and finished at $0.13 a share. If you exclude the lab and legal cost, net income would have finished at $4.1 million or about $0.19 a share. On the R&D side of the business, we are completing the validation of 8 cavity cover and barcode ring. We have submitted our lactate test to the FDA and our Lyme test to the USDA. We are close to completing the hemoglobin test and are making excellent progress on the [indiscernible] rapid test. Q4 goals include the keeping the focus on building our Vet Reference Lab business. We have some excellent trends and to keep this momentum going, we have a good chance of hitting our aggressive goals in our next fiscal year. Getting our European business back on track in Q4 is also a priority. We sold 218 instruments last quarter which was up 45% versus Q3 last year and with our warehouse project completed we expect consumable sales back to historic levels. Both our domestic Vet and medical businesses grew at double-digits last quarter, so keeping that momentum going is also a key goal and our two-by-two project is yielding excellent results as these cost reduction projects progress. While this is taking resources from both R&D and operations, keeping them on schedule is also a focus for Q4. The Abaxis board of directors has approved an additional $15 million to our stock buyback program which takes it to a total of $55 million. We bought back about $27 million in Abaxis stock in Q2, so there is about $28 million left in the plan. So with that, Marty, you’re on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I will provide some additional details surrounding the North American Animal Health core business and separately review our new AVRL division’s first quarter of operations. In our third quarter of fiscal year 2012, North American Animal Health reported revenues in our core business of $23.9 million, sequentially down 2% or just over $500,000 but up, year-over-year, $2.3 million or 11%. The quarter-over-quarter decline I attribute primarily to the short-term impacts of 2 Abaxis distributors last year being purchased by purchased by IDEXX distributors and as a result had to forego the Abaxis product line. These 2 distributors accounted for $1.7 million in revenues for Abaxis in our fourth quarter last year. While much of that business is now being served by other Abaxis distributors, a percentage did prefer to open accounts with Abaxis Direct and are now holding that inventory here. Our instrument business at the clinic level was very positive in our third quarter. We shipped 720 instruments and recorded a record 941 placements. Instruments purchased by animal hospitals, veterinary clinics and research facilities, the difference between these shipments and placements being a reduction in distributor inventory levels. We had record placements of our Chemistry Analyzer at 368 units, record placements of our hematology line and 277 units, record VSpro sales to clinics of 165 units and record i-STAT instrument sales at a 131 units. Abaxis instruments were purchased by 540 clinics in the quarter, 321 of which we were not previously doing reagent business with. Inclusive of our rapid diagnostics product line, Abaxis now does business with almost 14,000 of these 33,000 clinics in the U.S. and Canada. Some additional highlights for our third quarter, our rotor revenue was up 12% from a year ago, hematology reagents up 11% from a year ago, and our rapid test product lines up 123% or up $1 million versus a year ago. Once again I attribute our continued double-digits year-over-year growth to our investment in great people across the entire organization, representing great products and services and with world-class customer support. For example, in the U.S. and Canada, we have now 90 individuals in field sales, field sales management and professional services focused both on servicing the account base and 40 new customers. Now as to Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories, AVRL, in its first 90 days of nationwide operations, signs up and provided requisition forms and supplies to 1,351 clinics across the entire country. The marketplace’s interest level at launch was actually more than anticipated. We launched with some very aggressive programs including what we call couponing providing upfront credits at AVRL to incent the clinics to move some business from the competition to AVRL, and get a taste of what Abaxis can do in terms of turnaround time, quality, service and support. AVRL received over 5000 requisitions in the first 90-days of operations, in December, averaging over 100 per day. The highest number of requisitions per day in December was 154. Average revenue per requisition product promotional credits and discount programs was $38.39, again over what we had anticipated. We averaged in Q3 1.74 requisitions per day, per clinic, with average gross revenue before credits and discounts of $69.58. For the quarter, average gross revenue per day was $2,542 while for December that number was $3,845. By December, we crossed the $6000 mark for revenue in a given day, with at that time over 400 unique clinics already doing business with AVRL. In Q3 AVRL process and tool of 8,688 individuals assays or panels and we have already received samples from all 50 states and Puerto Rico. The mix has been 74% specialty esoteric-type testing, such as pathology, microbiology, immunology and 26% routine chemistry and hematology. So the mix was also better than expected. Our staff and 41 consultants representing 14 specialties has already assisted our customer base in taste management in a 117 instances. Pleased with marketplace’s acceptance and the nationwide attention AVRL has received the net revenue after credits and discounts was just over a $131,000. As I indicated, prior to the close of Q3, we had our first day of $6,000 in gross billing. So the business is already tracking at a $1.7 million business. December over November, the sequential growth in gross billings was 54%. We expect that growth rate to accelerate as we continue to capitalize on the Q3 aggressive sales and marketing programs and we have launched additional unique programs for our Q4. As to AVRL’s impact to our core business, we believe that we have already, in 90 days, we have proof-of-concepts. 87 clinics purchased Abaxis instruments in conjunction with utilization of AVRL services; 56 new customers and 31 we were previously doing business with, who had added or upgraded instruments along with signing up for AVRL. A total of 171 Abaxis instruments were bundled with AVRL services in its first quarter of operations accounting for $1.3 million in Abaxis revenue. Additionally, there were 43 instruments sold as a result of local AVRL launch events held across the country. So I think we can trace over $1.6 million in Q3 instrument revenue back to our AVRL division. Now the residual business, going forward from these 214 instruments will help sustain Abaxis growth and I expect the AVRL impact to instrument sales and reagent utilization to accelerate. And with that, Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you very much, Marty and I would like to introduce Brenton Hanlon, in charge of our Piccolo business in North America. Brenton you’re on. Brenton G. A. Hanlon Former Vice President of Medical Sales & Marketing for North America Thanks, Clint. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q3 the U.S. team posted record revenues of $5.7 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter and Q3 rotor sales continued to be very strong at $4.3 million, 14% over Q3 of last year and 9% higher than Q2 this year. The uncertainty regarding the future direction of healthcare continues to depress the market for capital equipment within the physician office sector. Despite these current difficult market conditions, the U.S. medical team sold 133 Piccolos in Q3. This is a 14% increase over Q3 of last year and a 46% increase over Q2 of this fiscal year. Primary Care, which includes family practice, urgent care clinics, pediatrics and internal medicine continues to our sweet spot, accounting to approximately 75% of the new customers we added in Q3. Primary Care will continue to be a focus, the focus of our physician office sales organization. We believe our more selective approach to Piccolo placements and our new value proposition of real-time actionable information patient convenience and practice efficiency is gaining traction and results in greater instrument utilization by physicians. As the rotor per instrument ratio improves, so does our sales per employee and our selling expenses continue to decrease as a percentage of sales. In addition to our physician office efforts we continue to expand our portfolio of larger accounts. For example, a chain of urgent care clinics now has 53 Piccolos and a concierge medicine company now has 47. We are also making headway with our new IDN initiatives. The sales cycles for these larger opportunities is quite long, however the potential rewards are very attractive. We also continue to work with our large potential customer which has been evaluating the Piccolo for their in-store clinics. They’ve requested our assistance with some joint commission requirements and regulatory support for our finger state application. Our focus is to work on these projects to make sure the implementation of the Piccolo point-of-care chemistry instrument throughout this system is seamless. While we cannot predict the timing or outcome of these projects, we believe the Piccolo is a tool that will help our customer’s vision to become a reality. Now there has been a change in their plan. The original pilot study is complete and the customer no longer considers it necessary to perform an expanded pilot, rather they plan to go directly to a rollout. So overall, Q3 was a quite a successful one for the U.S. medical team and we continue to make progress in all areas. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Okay, Brenton, thank you very much and with that, we are open for questions."

Clint? <strong>Clint Severson</strong> Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q4 FY08 along with fiscal year FY08, and then some of the goals for FY09. After my short presentation, I will ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Sales and Marketing, and Chris Bernard, our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing, to give us an update on their respective businesses. We will then take questions. Well, we did it. Over $100 million in sales for the year, a milestone for Abaxis. Over the last 12 years, we have grown sales at a compounded annual growth rate of 34%, and over the last seven years since we reached profitability our operating earnings have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 106%. This has all been accomplished in an environment of stiff competition and doing things no one else has ever successfully done before. While we are proud of these accomplishments, we had challenges for the quarter and for the year. As many of you know, we entered FY08 with production problems on our new chemistry platform, the VS2 and Piccolo xpress. While we have made many improvements in manufacturing, and have reduced instrument infant mortality field failures by about 62% since June '07, these issues have had a negative effect on our performance for the year. We are on track for cutting in the new parts from our new vendor starting this quarter and ending next quarter. While the impact of these instrument issues continues to decrease, it will be another one to two quarters before they are fully behind us. The result of these instrument problems was fewer sales of VetScans in FY08. While we made up for some of the shortfall in hematology and Piccolo sales, our overall growth rate was negatively affected with these problems. We expect going into FY09 to see improvements in VetScan instrument sales, especially in the last two quarters. Even though these instrument challenges have haunted us for the last six quarters, we posted another record quarter, finishing Q408 at $26.7 million, up 17% year-over-year and 4% quarter- over-quarter. For the year, we finished at $100,551,000, up $14,330,000, or 17%. Clearly our soft spot for the year was Vet instruments. Total VetScan sales of 1,355 units was down 258 units, or down 16% year-over- year. While part of this was due to a change in the responsibilities of our Vet sales team from instrument sales only to both consumables and instruments, the bulk of the problems were due to field failures. Now the improvements we have made over the last three quarters have led to quarter-over-quarter VetScan sales increases in FY08, with Q2 sales of VetScans of 297 units; Q3 sales of VetScan 341 units; and Q4 sales of 385 units. We need to finish the scale-up project to get the growth in Vet instrument sales back to historical levels. Vet hematology instrument sales totaled 212 units for Q4. This is down from Q3 sales of 301, but up slightly from Q407 sales of 207. For the year we sold 977 hematology instruments, up 105 units, or 12%. Total Vet sales for the quarter finished at a record $18.6 million, up 10% year-over-year. VetScan instrument sales of 385 units were flat versus Q4 or last year's performance of 382. Vet disc sales for the quarter finished at $12,400,000, up 17.3% year-over-year, and 9% quarter-over- quarter. In units, Vet disc sales for the quarter finished at just under 1 million units or 977,000. For the year, Vet disc sales totaled $46,320,000, up 23% or about 3,643,000 units. For the year, worldwide Vet sales finished at $71.1 million, up 11%. Consumables sales of $50.1 million were up 21% for the year, while Vet instrument sales of $20 million, or 2,332 units, were down about 6%. Record total medical sales of $6,309,000 were up 27% year-over-year and beat last quarter's record by 5%. Medical disc sales of $369,451 were also a record, up 31% year-over-year and 17% quarter- over-quarter. For the year, medical disc sales totaled $1,298,000, up 27%. Excluding the government, worldwide medical disc unit sales for the quarter were up 45% year-over-year and up 24% quarter-over- quarter. For the year, excluding the government sales or military sales, worldwide medical disc sales were up 39%, finishing at 1,116,000 units. We sold a total of 218 Piccolos last quarter, up 19%, or 35 units versus Q4 last year. This was in addition to the installation of over 100 units sold in the last month of Q3. For the year, we sold 811 Piccolos, up 26%, or 167 units versus FY07. For FY08, total medical sales of $22.8 million, a record and a milestone, first time over $20 million, were up 30%. Excluding the military, total medical sales FY08 was up 35%. North American sales totaled $22 million for Q4, up 13% year-over-year and 1.5% quarter-over-quarter. Flat Vet instrument sales both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter slowed our growth in this region. For FY08, North American sales finished at $83.8 million, up 16% or about 83% of our total sales for the year. International sales of $4.8 million, also a record, were up 39% year-over-year and up 18% quarter-over- quarter. European sales of $3.8 million were up 36% year-over-year and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, European sales totaled $13,470,000, up 30%. Sales in the Pac Rim finished Q4 at $935,000, up 51% year-over-year and 41% quarter-over-quarter. Sales in Q4 included an order from Japan for about $402,000. For the year, international sales totaled $16,700,000, up about 18% or about 17% of our total worldwide sales. Military or government sales of $1,062,000 were up a strong 61% year-over-year and up 16% quarter- over-quarter. For the year, government sales of $3,776,000 were up 15% or about 3.8% of our total business. Capital sales for the quarter made up about 29% of the total sales, and consumables finished at 71%. This compares with 32%, 68% for Q4 last year, and 33%, 67% last quarter. Medical sales were about 24% of total sales for this quarter; Vet sales about 70%; and others 6%. This compares with 22%, 74%, 6% Q4 of last year, and 23%, 77% last quarter. Total disc sales finished the quarter at a record 1,347,000 units, up 17% year-over-year and 11% quarter- over-quarter. For the year, we sold 4,941,000 discs, up 20%. Disc average selling price for the year finished at $11.78, up $0.34, or 2.9%. Average disc cost for the year finished at $4.34, down $0.14 versus FY07, or down about 3.1%. We had a price increase on domestic Vet discs of about 7% effective April 1, 2008. For the quarter, we sold a total of 815 instruments, up 43 units, year-over-year, or up about 6%. Quarter- over-quarter instrument sales were down about 65 units. Q3 is usually a stronger instrument quarter than Q4. For the year, we sold a total of 3,143 instruments, up only 14 units compared to FY07. And as I mentioned before, Vet instrument sales were negatively affected by the manufacturing problems; and within the next quarter or two we should have the scale-up project completed. Gross profit for the quarter finished at a record of $14,600,000, up 19% year-over-year and 7% quarter- over-quarter, or 54.5% of sales, up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 60 basis points year- over-year. For the year, gross profit of $55 million was up 17% or 54.7% of sales, up 40 basis points versus FY '07. Again, instrument manufacturing problems negatively affected our performance in this area. Operating expenses for the year met our goal of decreasing as a percent of sales year-over-year. For the quarter, operating expenses at $9.8 million finished at 36.7% of sales versus 36% of sales Q4 last year. For the year, operating expenses as a percent of sales were 37.1%, compared with 37.7% of sales FY07. Sales and marketing expenses of $6 million, or 22.5% of sales were down from 23.1% of sales Q4 last year and down from 23.6% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses of $1,862,000, or 7% of sales were up year-over-year by 61 basis points and up 62 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Admin expenses of $1,920,000, or 7.2% of sales were higher year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to the implementation cost of our new ERP system. Year-over-year, they were up 59 basis points and quarter- over-quarter they were up 106 basis points. Despite our instrument manufacturing issues and the disruption and upfront costs associated with the implementation of a new ERP computer system, our operating earnings hit a new record, coming in at $4,756,000, or 17.8% of sales, up 17% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter, or $0.21 a share. For the year, operating income finished at 17,708,000, up 23% or $0.80 a share. Pretax income for the quarter at $5,272,000 was up 13% or $0.24 a share. For the year, pretax income totaled $19,804,000 or about $0.89 a share. Net income for the quarter finished at a record $3,312,000, up 19% or $0.15 a share. For the year, net income totaled $12,503,000, up 24% or $0.56 a share. On the R&D side of the business, the focus continues to be on optimizing the manufacturing process of the VS2 and Piccolo xpress. We expect the new and improved parts from our vendors to be cut in this quarter and next quarter. Our goal over the next few months is to have bulletproof instruments with a capacity of thousands of units per quarter. The last four tests for CLIA-waiver status are at the FDA, and we expect to hear any day on the three that were submitted in Q3. The heartworm project is just about completed, and the clinical trials are scheduled for this quarter. We hope to have this important product ready for USDA submission in June or July. The C-reactive protein test is also close to completion, with clinical trials scheduled for the end of Q1 or the beginning of Q2. Goals for FY '09 include completing the instrument scale-up project by the end of Q2, expanding the sales and marketing coverage in both the Vet and medical markets, reducing operating expense as a percent of sales, expanding our gross margins, completing the development and launch of our heartworm and CRP tests, and to continue to make progress in hitting our dollar a share in earnings. So with that, I would like to introduce Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Sales and Marketing. Marty? <strong>Martin Mulroy</strong> Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. The North American veterinary business finished the fourth-quarter FY08 with $14.4 million in revenue, up only 4% year-over-year due to fewer chemistry instruments sold year-over-year. Revenue continues to be impacted by the VS2 manufacturing problems experienced over the past six quarters, resulting in field failures and impacting field sales productivity. Additionally, we made changes this fiscal year to the responsibilities of the field sales team where there is accountability for both capital equipment and consumable sales. While we have seen a big improvement in infant mortality on the VS2, we are still doing multiple site visits, trainings, and installations in 10% to 15% of new customers. The loss of field sales productivity has been a drag on our performance for both the quarter and the fiscal year. In Q4, we sold 443 Vet instruments, 10 fewer than Q4 last year; and for the year we sold 1,742 Vet instruments, down 40 units from the prior year. For fiscal year 2008, North American veterinary sales were a record $56.3 million, up 11% or $5.6 million. Consumable sales for the quarter finished at a record $10.7 million, up 9% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, consumable sales were a record of $40.9 million, up 20% or $6.7 million versus FY07. Again, our holding the Abaxis field sales force and field sales management team this past fiscal year accountable also for consumable sales and customer care has met the goal of increasing sales, despite the limited market coverage of our distribution. For the coming fiscal year with more VS2 volume quality improvements being rapidly implemented and the infant mortality rates declining, we are confident we can get the capital equipment segment of our business back to historical growth levels. Goals for FY '09 include optimizing our distribution through a program whereby we have increased incentives to distributors that surpass aggressive sales goals and are reducing margins where minimum performance requirements are not met. Goals for FY09 include also continued increased market penetration in geographic areas with limited or no distribution through our moving instruments on a direct basis exclusively with our own sales force and further expansion of the field sales and sales management teams in these areas. And with that, I will turn it back over to Clint. <strong>Clint Severson</strong> Great, thank you, Marty. Okay, now we will hear from Chris Bernard, our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing. Chris, you are on. <strong>Christopher Bernard</strong> Thanks, Clint. Afternoon, folks. Strong performance on the medical side despite some of the earlier challenges that Clint had mentioned. First, the fiscal year numbers were as follows. Annual US medical sales, minus the military, increased 31% to $16.5 million versus $12.1 million in FY07. Piccolo sales FY08 $7.1 million, were up 24% or $1.4 million compared to FY07. That's 489 Piccolos versus 573 in FY08. In FY08 we surpassed the 1,000 placement milestone for Piccolos, and presently we are just under 1,500 placements to-date. Disc sales for FY08 were up 35% or $2.3 million over FY07. We finished FY08 just shy of a total of 1 million discs at 983,000. This was in spite of some flatness Q2 to Q3 in FY08. For the quarter, US medical sales, minus the military, were up 24% at $4.5 million year-over-year and up 7% quarter-over-quarter. US medical disc sales, minus the military, were up 35% at 291,000 versus 207,000 year-over-year and up 25% quarter-over-quarter. With continued focus on the higher volume accounts, the average daily rotor usage Yemongst customers continues to eke up. We now estimate the average rotor usage per day to be around 5.3 rotors per day. In the US, we sold 143 Piccolos and had a total placement of 115 systems in Q4 versus 138 Piccolos sold a year ago. Placements by segment were 44 FP/GP internal medicine; 13 multi-specialties; 18 hematology/ oncology; 9 radiology; 7 urgent care; and 10 domestic government sales. For the year, top new customers were as follows. 185 new FP and GPs; 96 new accounts in FY07 -- versus 96 new accounts in FY07; 54 radiology; 47 urgent care; and 28 new hematology-oncology accounts. Top distributor for the quarter went to PSS with 46 placements. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the revenue strategy and the performance of the medical sales team in FY08. Despite the instrument challenges we achieved a number of milestones this past year. Some quick highlights. Launch of the first-ever point-of-care waived chemistry analyzer, surpassing the 1,000 Piccolo customer barrier; surpassing the quarter-million mark in rotors Q4, and narrowly missing the 1 million rotors for the year; the addition of McKesson, Cardinal, and NDC to the distributor channel; the first distributor to pass $1 million in revenue reagents in a single quarter; and of course the launch of our kidney check panel specific for imaging centers in Q2 of this past year. As mentioned in the January earnings call, Q4, due to reimbursement hurdles, was to be a challenging quarter. Instrument challenge coupled with the delay in the Medicare loading of the QW modifier to the existing CPT codes resulted in the expected shortfall in the instrument sales in Q4. As of April 1, these codes are now officially loaded, and Medicare is in the process of notifying its regional carriers. Aligning growth expectations with our distributor partners has proved to be challenging as well. We will be aggressively working with each of them these next few quarters to maximize not only market coverage but sales potential. Our goal is to obtain consistent exposure to the respective sales forces throughout the year versus quarterly programs. An initial look into FY '09 reveals continued headcount expansion heading towards 18; continued execution of our URL program specifically targeting market segmentation; media [ph] exploration and expansion into the health screening, health promotion, occupational health and mobile screening markets; anticipation of final three panels becoming CLIA-waived -- the renal, hepatic, and Metlyte 8; positive price adjustments to certain well-reimbursed panels; and lastly, the addition of a strategic business director to hunt and cultivate all the markets outside of the physician office lab. With that I will pass it back to you, Clint. <strong>Clint Severson</strong> Great, thank you, Chris. With that, we are open for questions."

With that having been said, I'd like to turn the call over Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q4 FY '09 and the full-year FY '09 and then some of our goals for 2010. After my short presentation I'll ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing to give an update on his business. And Rick Betts, our Director of Marketing for North American Medical Market to outline the plan for our medical business, going forward. We'll then take questions. Well, for the year, we grew the business at 5% and finished the year at 105 million, a new record. But for the quarter, we were down slightly about 1% year-over-year, finishing the quarter at $26.3 million. With the exception of our Domestic Vet business, which grew 13% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over- quarter, we have challenges in all the other segments. Now, first for Domestic Medical business. For those who were on our last conference call, you may remember my discussions regarding our goal to put together a plan to move Piccolo® instrument sales from the hundreds to a thousand quarter. In Q4, we started working on this plan by testing sale tools, pricing flexibility and direct instrument sales. This was a significant change from our previous strategy of chasing leads and chasing numbers. In order for us to build a strong medical business, we will need to focus our market coverage on segments where demand is the strongest at the tools to make purchasing of Piccolo® easier, have flexible pricing for areas where reimbursement is less, recruit key influencers in each market segment to help with the message and participate on our scientific advisory board. We need to attend their trade shows and get to know them on a level where we develop credibility. All this started in Q4 and Rick Betts will share more of you later on the call. While we were working on validating these new strategies and not focused on chasing numbers, we sold fewer Piccolo® instruments, finishing the quarter at 96 units. The domestic market placed 71 units, 41 of those were shipped from Abaxis and the balance 30 came from distributor inventory. Another change in Q4 is we shipped only three Piccolo® units to distributor warehouses and do not intend to ship any warehouse units in the future. We expect, going forward, most instrument sales will be direct in our target markets. More to come from Rick later. Piccolo® instrument sales in Europe and the Pac Rim finished at 41 units, down from 57 units in Q3, but up from 38 units Q4 last year. Government Piccolo® instrument sales of 14 units were down from 49 units in Q3 and 37 units in Q4 last year. As we move away from a strategy of chasing leads and numbers to a strategy that focuses on target markets, we should see more consistency in instrument sales. For the year, total Piccolo® instrument sales finished at 713 units, down from 811 units sold last year, mostly due to lower sales in Q4. Piccolo® disc sales, however, were up year-over-year, finishing at 412,464 units, or up about 12%. The down about 12% from last quarter strong showing, which was up 48% in Q3. So the timing of orders to distributors in Europe and the U.S., and to some extent the slower economy, were reasons for the decline quarter-over-quarter. For the year, Piccolo® disc sales finished at 1,718,000 units, up a very strong 32%. Total medical sales for the quarter finished at five million down both year-over-year and quarter-over- quarter due to fewer instrument sales. For FY '09, medical sales finished at 24.8 million, up above 9% for the year and represented 23% of total sales. Total worldwide net sales for the quarter at 19.6 million were up 5% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter with strong domestic sales and weaker international sales. For the year, worldwide Vet sales at $74 million were up 4% and represented 70% of total sales. Total VetScan® instrument sales of 345 units for Q4, while down from 385 in Q4 last year and down from 403 last quarter, were strong considering a weak economy. The weakness for the quarter was in the international market, with VetScan® sales of 71 units versus 115 Q4 last year and 116 last quarter. The U.S. market saw an increase year-over-year and Marty will cover that shortly. For the year, we sold a total of 1,524 VetScan®s up 12% or 169 instruments. Total Vet disc sales in Q4 at $13,264,000 were up about 7% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter, with the growth coming from the US market. In units, disc sales for Q4 finished at 946,000 units, up 14% quarter-over-quarter but down about 31,000 units year-over-year due to slower international Vet disc sales, which were down 41,000 units year-over- year but up 55,000 units quarter-over-quarter. Total Vet disc sales for the year finished at the 48.6 million or 3.6 million units, up 5% in dollars and down about 2% in units mostly due to slower international Vet disc sales. Hematology instrument sales of 177 units were also down from Q4 last year’s total of 212 and last quarter sales of 241. However, hematology reagent packs at $1.2 million were up 27% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Fewer instrument sales were due to more focus on the coag and heartworm in the domenstic market and the slower economy worldwide. For the year, we sold a total of 805 hematology instruments down from 977 sold last year. In FY '09 we sold $4.6 million worth of hematology reagent packs up 22%. For the quarter, we sold a total of 715 instruments including 97 coag machines. This compares to 815 instruments sold in Q4 '08 and 886 in the seasonal's stronger Q3 '09. For the year, total instrument sales finished at 3,139 down only four instruments from FY '08, each [ph] finish of 3,143, which is not bad for the economy the way it is. Total disc sales for Q4 at $17 million were up 8% year- over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. In units, total disc sales finished at 1,358,000 units in Q4, up about 1%. For the year, total disc sales of $64 million were up 10% versus FY '08. And in units, disc sales for the year finished at just under 5.3 million units, up 7%. Total international sales for Q4 of 4.1 million were down 14.2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over- quarter. European sales at 3.2 million were up quarter-over-quarter by 6%, but down about 16% year- over-year, mostly due to the economy and currency. Pac Rim sales of $887,000 were down about 5% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to currency which in some cases almost doubled the price of our products in local money compared to last year. We believe it will take a couple of quarters for the international distributors to adjust to this current environment. We believe we can get our growth back in these markets in FY '10. For the year, total international sales finished at 17.8 million, up 6% or about 17% of total sales. Military or government sales in Q4 totaled $707,000, down 33% compared to Q4 last year and down 42% over the last quarter. We had exceptional sales growth from the government in the first three quarters of FY '09, which could explain the weakness in Q4. Total government sales for the year at 4,463,000, now we're up 18%. Domestic sales finished Q4 at 22.2 million up 1.3%. For the year, domestic sales totaled 87.8 million, up 5%. For the quarter, 84% of sales were domestic and 16% were international. For the year 83% of sales were domestic and 17 international. For Q4, 21% of the sales were capital sales while 79% were consumable. This compares with 29 71 Q4 last year and 30 70 last quarter. For the year, capital sales made up 27% of total sales while 73% were consumable. This compares with 30 70 FY '08. Medical sales for the quarter totaled 19% of total sales while Vet finished at 74% and other was 7%. This compares with 24 76 Q4 last year and 27 66 seven last quarter. For the year, medical sales were 23% of total sales, Vet 70% and others seven, about the same as last year. Gross margins for Q4 '09 were up about 120 basis points year-over-year finishing at 55.7%. For the year, gross margin was up 80 basis points. Strong gross margin on discs and lower cost on instruments were the main reasons. Disc average selling price for the year finished at a record $12.14, up $0.36 over FY '08 or up 3%. Average disc cost of $4.21 was down $0.13 or about 3% versus FY '08. Total disc gross margin finished the year at 65%, up 217 basis points versus last year. Operating expenses for Q4 totaled 10.5 million or 39.8% of sales, higher due to increased spending in sales and marketing and R&D for the launch of our Vet products. This is up from 36.7% of sales Q4 last year and 38% of sales last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses of 6.3 million or 24% of sales, were up from 22.5% compared to Q4 last year and 22.5% last quarter. R&D expenses at 2.2 million or 8.5% of sales were up compared to 7% Q4 last year and 7.6% of sales last quarter. As I mentioned before, higher spending was due to costs associated with the launch of the heartworm and the coag product. Admin expenses of 1.9 million or 7.2% of sales were flat as a percent of sales year-over-year and down from 8.3% of sales quarter-over-quarter. Total expenses for the year at $40.8 million 38.7% of sales were up 155 basis points versus last year. Slower sales growth and higher expenditures on the new products were the main reason. Even though gross profit for Q4 was up about 1% year-over-year, higher operating expenses tied to the launch of the new products resulted in lower operating earnings finishing the quarter at 4.2 million, down about $558,000 year-over-year and $568,000 quarter-over-quarter. Now this new product investment depressed earnings short term. We believe these new products and the ones we'll be launching in FY 2010 will help us get us back to double-digits sales and earnings growth this year. For the year, operating income totaled 17.8 million up about 1%. Lower operating income and lower investment income depressed our net income in Q4, which finished at $2.6 million down about 728,000 versus Q4 last year, and down 772,000 over quarter finishing $0.12 a share. $385,000 or about $0.02 of the reduction in net earnings versus Q4 last year was due to reduced interest income on our cash balance. For the year, net income per share totaled $0.54, down $0.02 compared to FY '08. $0.04 of the reduction in net income can be attributed to lower investment income due to lower interest rates on our investments. On the R&D side of the business, we are very productive. The team validated the new coag instrument and consumable as well as our new rapid Heart/Lung test. We started and completed the clinical trial and C-reactive protein and the heartworm on the disc. Both have been submitted to the FDA and the USDA. The C-reactive protein rotor will be launching outside the U.S. next week. The magnesium has been recalibrated and will be submitted to the FDA for waive status as soon as the validation is completed against the atomic absorption, at the Mayo Lab. Validation and submission for waive status is expected within a week. The direct billing rotor [ph] and recalibration project led to the recognition at the reference method probably lacks specificity which causes inaccurate results. We'll be working with the one site in the US that runs this method to reconcile this problem so we can get our detailing test made. The detailing test, however, is not material to our medical business at this point. Our goals for FY 2010 include restoring sales and earnings growth to double digits, out with the goal of a dollar share in earnings. We'll be implementing our new segment focus marking a sales and strategy in the medical markets and expanding the sales force to about 20 folks, including one additional area sales director. We'll be expanding our market coverage on the Vet side and launching the heartworm and rotor. We'll be completing the development of two to three more rapid tests for the Vet market. We'd continue to work on reducing expenses as a percent of sales. We have a continued focus on new factory initiatives to improve cost and quality with the goal to expand gross margins and we'll be developing and launching the C-reactive protein test with the Vet market. So with that, Marty, you're on next. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. I'll provide a brief overview breaking out a few numbers to the Abaxis North American Animal Health business. The Veterinary business in the US and Canada generated record revenues of $16.3 million in our fourth quarter fiscal year in 2009, up 8% or 1.2 million in the prior quarter and up 13% or 1.9 million year- over-year. For the year, our revenue was 59.3 million, up 5% or up over $3 million from FY 2008. In the U.S., our instrument revenue has yet to be significantly impacted by the economic uncertainty and global recession. Both Q4 year-over-year and for the fiscal year versus last year, our instrument revenue is unchanged. Our Consumable business did very well. For the fiscal year up 7%. Q4 versus prior quarter up 15% and Q4 versus year ago, our Consumable business was up 19%. This quarter we launched some shift to new products: there are VetScan Canine Heartworm Rapid Test, a highly accurate, sensitive and specific assay which is fast, easy use and easy to read. We also launched this product to the market place at a price significantly less than currently entrenched competitors. We also launched the VetScan Vspro, an instrument for measuring coagulation time in clinics in minutes. Demand is accelerating now for both products. A key off [ph] in current quarter is the same as it was last quarter and the quarter before. Continued emphasis and focus by our marketing team and sales force and the economic advantages and efficiencies provided by Abaxis laboratory products relative to any alternatives. The teams here in the building and those in the field clearly are executing very, very well. This is what brings us new business. Additionally, we have put in place several new customer-centered programs, such as a new customer rewards program, enhanced continuing education program and other in-clinic, laboratory, educational programs for veterinarians and technicians. While building momentum with the two new products mentioned, we are busy preparing for the launch of the rotor-based canine heartworm antigen test. We anticipate rapid acceptance and adoption of this new product upon its release as well. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much, Marty. And now I'd like to introduce Rick Betts. He's probably new to everybody here. He's been associated with Abaxis for about three years and he's been managing all of our marketing functions in-house here. So with that, Rick, you're on. Rick Betts Former Director of Medical Sales & Marketing - Medical Diagnostics Thank you, Clint and good afternoon, everyone. As Clint mentioned in his opening statement, the domestic medical division has been working on validating a new focus strategy in our top vertical market. This validation is complete and we are in the process of executing this strategic plan. The primary vertical markets we are targeting are urgent care, internal medicine and oncology, with radiology and pediatrics as secondary target. In these markets, the Piccolo® technology is more of a necessity rather than a luxury due to the time-sensitivity, business [ph] volume and critical nature of these practices. As a result, demand is higher in these markets and the RY [ph] picture for point of care diagnostics is better. Q4 placements by segment were, 28 urgent care, 14 general and family practitioners, eight internal medicine, seven hematology and oncology, five radiology and nine multispecialty in hospitals to account. In our current customer base, 16% or 302 customers are urgent care. 173 are internal medicine and 164 are ecology. These three markets represent roughly 35% of our current Piccolo® install base and greater than 50% of our reagent disc usage. Together these markets total roughly 50,000 practices in our target geography. And as Clint mentioned, we have initiated an aggressive multi-prong marketing plan to get our message out to these practices. This marketing effort is already driving a significant amount of interest in comprehensive clear wave point of care chemistry for which the Piccolo® is the only solution. In addition to focus revenue placements, we're implementing a plan to assist our distribution partners in covering the rest of the medical market place which includes the general practitioner. We began fiscal year '10 with a field sales force of 12 reps. They will be quickly moving to 15 headcount with plans to finish the year with 19 full-time sales representatives and three area directors. Additional upside for fiscal year '10 will come from traction with our business development initiative. This initiative is focused on large health care organizations, health screening companies, occupational health and reference laboratory companies, all of which represent double or triple digit increment purchases, along with large reagent disc commitment. Additional development underway for fiscal year '10 are: first, as Clint mentioned, the new release of the C-reactive protein which is currently in 510(k) review by the FDA and is expected to be released and is expected to be released in early July. The CRP will appear on a new disc titled ""MetLife Plus CRP"". Secondly, we are aggressively expanding our strategic advisory board to getting in with one of the top urgent doctors in the United States and growing into internal medicine and oncology. We look for continued penetration into the health screening, occupational health and large multi-regional clinic marketplace through our business development initiative. And lastly, we are implementing a focus plan on improving rotor usage for our current customers. [indiscernible] and we remain highly optimistic about the prospects for a solid fiscal year 10. With that, I will turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Rick. At this point we're open for questions."

With that having been said, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Okay, thank you Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I will take a few minutes here and review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q4, 2011, and for the full fiscal year 2011 and then some of the goals for FY 2012. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, our VP of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of Sales and Marketing for North American Medical to give an update on their respective businesses. And then we’ll take some questions. The challenges for Q4 is centered mostly on expenses, legal expenses tied to the FTC investigation of competitor and the Cepheid patent suit cost us about 738,000 in Q4 and for the year, these legal costs were about 971,000. We also had lower royalty income which was down 88% year-over-year and down 11% quarter-over-quarter, which negatively affected our gross margin. In the factory while the incidents of traffic problems almost disappeared as we continue to do extra QC testing which resulted in slightly higher factory cost. As of April 18th, our QC testing is returned to normal levels. In Q4, the bonus and profit sharing plans adjust for the year and because of our performance our incentive compensation was higher in Q4 than it was in Q3. But even with these issues, our pre-tax and net income increased double digits for Q4 and the year more to follow little later. We finished the quarter in the fiscal year with record sales, our Q4 sales totaled $37.5 million up 12% year-over-year and up 5% quarter-over-quarter and for the year total sales were up 15% finishing at $143.7 million. Record net sales for Q4 at $28.7 million were up 15% for the year finishing at $108 million over the $100 million milestone for the first time and up 17% versus last year sales of $92.4 million. Worldwide medical sales also finished at record levels for fiscal year 2011 and totaled $29 million up 20%. For Q4 worldwide medical sales finished at $7.6 million up 10% versus Q4 last year. Total North American sales for Q4 also finished at record $30.6 million up 11% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter and for the year North American sales totaled $118 million up 16%. Total international sales for Q4 at $6.9 million were up 14% year-over-year and 19% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, international sales finished at a record $25.7 million up 11%. European sales for Q4 totaled $5.5 million up 13% year-over- year and up 21% quarter-over-quarter. For the year European sales finished at a record $20 million up 10%. Pac-Rim sales for Q4 finished at $1.5 million up 20% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter and for 2011 Pac-Rim sales finished at a record $5.4 million up 16%. Government sales for Q4 totaled 706,000 down about 9% versus Q4 last year but for FY 2011 government sales totaled $4.4 million up 23%. Worldwide instrument sales in units finished the quarter at 1,074 units, up 9 units or about 1% versus Q4 last year. For the year, instrument sales totaled 4,348 instruments, up about 8% or 312 units. For Q4, we sold 427 VetScans versus 399, Q4 last year and 433 last quarter. For the year, we sold 1,620 VetScans which was down about 6% versus last year. We sold 226 hematology instruments versus 236, Q4 last year and for the year we sold a total of a 1,000 hematology units of about 12%. We sold 173 Piccolos including 15 units to the government versus 150 Q4 last year and 235 last quarter. The run rate of the non-government Piccolo sales was since we changed our strategy is as follows, Q4 ‘09 82, Q1 ‘10 88, Q2 ‘10 116, Q3 ‘10 130, Q4 ‘10 144, Q1 ‘11 147, Q2 ‘11 172, Q3 ‘11 176 and Q4 ‘11 158. While Q4 was down from Q3, non-government Piccolo instrument sales were up 10% versus Q4 last year. For FY 2011, total Piccolo instrument sales finished at 769 units, up 34%. Now excluding government sales, Piccolo instrument sales finished up 37%. So, I think it was pretty good indication that this loop focus is working. And finally, we sold 248 coag and i-STAT units versus 280 Q4 last year and 290 last quarter. For the year we sold 959 coag and i-STAT instruments versus 844 in FY 2010 up 14%. Total disc sales were also have record levels finishing Q4 at just under $1.8 million units up 15% year-over-year and 14% quarter- over-quarter. In dollars disc sales finished the quarter at $22.5 million up 18% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter. For the year total disc sales finished at $6.4 million units up 12%.

This compares with 2,278 Q4 last year and 2,674 last quarter. For the year the mix was 2,278. 18% of total sales in Q4 were international sales while 82% were North American.

Total disc gross margin at 67% for the year was down about 49 basis points. Some of the new cost reduction processes will come on line this year and if successful we should see disc drop to below $4 in 2012. While gross profit for Q4 was up 9% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter, gross margin for Q4 finished at 54.5%, down about 1.4 percentage points year-over-year mostly due to lower royalty income, slightly higher factory cost mentioned earlier and for the year gross profit was up 11% and gross margins finished at 55.5% versus 57.9% in 2010. Operating expenses for Q4 finished at 40% of sales, an improvement over the 42% of sales Q4 last year but 9% of sales last quarter. Excluding the higher cost mentioned earlier operating expenses would have finished Q4 at 38% of sales.

For FY 2011 net income totaled $14.5 million, up 12% or $0.64 a share and per share was up 10% compared to 2010. On the R&D side of the business, we together with a partner finished the development and introduction in our waiting clearance from the UFDA so we can start shipping the Giardia rapid test. And we completed most of the development on the next two rapid tests. We are working on deciding whether to manufacture these new tests in-house or contract it out. Our objective is have this decision made in the quarter all started this quarter with the submission next quarter. The hemoglobin and the disc test is in manufacturing scale up and because this test requires a different manufacturing process than our chemistry test, it’s very important we understand all the potential issues required to hundreds of thousands of these test a day. We expect this to be completed in the next six months. Rapid test is almost ready to go to clinicals and we expect this to be submitted to the regulatory authorities in the next four or five months. Goals for FY 2012 include number one, gaining the new Abaxis Veterinary Reference Lab up and running, keeping the cost in line with the budget and start taking samples in the next six months, maintaining our strong sales momentum in both the medical market moving our R&D projects specialty in to rapid test on schedule, continue to reduce expenses as a percent of sale. We see objectives on the 2x2 project with the focus of disc cost below $4 this fiscal year. And with that Marty, you’re on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon everybody. In my prepared remarks I will provide an update for the North American Animal Health business. For our fourth quarter fiscal year 2011 North American Animal Health generated record revenues of $23.2 million, up $1.7 million or 8% from the prior quarter and up 16% or $3.2 million from a year ago. For the fiscal year North American Animal Health generated $87.2 million in revenue, up $14.4 million or 20% versus FY ‘10, excuse me. A record 894,708 rotors were purchased in Q4, up 22% from the prior quarter and up 24% from a year ago. Rotors accounted for a record $13.8 million in revenue in Q4. We shipped 672 instruments in Q4 supporting 275 new customers. For the fiscal year we shipped a record 2,724 instruments supporting a total of 938 new reagent customers. Abaxis veterinary reference laboratory is as Clint on track to begin processing samples in our fiscal third quarter. We have assembled quite a team beginning with the executive staff hired in Olathe, Kansas, our partners at K-State University in Manhattan, Kansas with the team here in Union City at Abaxis corporate and with our advisory board and some well-known and highly respected consultants participating. Early indications are that our ability to provide routine critical care and emergency laboratory medicine at the point of care as well I assume being able to provide a balance of the marketplaces testing needs through our Reference Lab facility will be very well received. I want to once again thank and congratulate the North American Animal Health Group on a record quarter and a record great fiscal year with a lot in the pipeline and everyone is excited about FY ‘12 and the years to follow. And with that back to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great thank you Marty. Okay next, Brenton you are on. Brenton Hanlon Thanks, Clint. Good afternoon, everyone. Two floors away is a difficult quarter for Piccolo Sales because many physicians have purchased capital equipment in Q3 to take advantage of the tax credit. Even so in Q4 2011 the U.S. team continued to expand our business base adding 104 new customers. Once again the top three practice segments for urgent care was 21% of the new customers, family practice was 15%, and internal management with 11% of the new customers. Our U.S. Medical Systems segment continued to grow in Q4. We added two more integrated delivering network customers and one more Concierge Medical chain customer. We now have 13 national accounts with a total of 190 Piccolo in that segment. Each of these accounts started small and as added Piccolo over the time. Our largest national account accounted for approximately $500,000 in rotor revenues in 2011. On the consumable side of the business Q4 U.S. medical revenues were $4.1 million, an increase of 7% of the Q4 2010 and an increase of 9% compared to last quarter. This increase indicates that we’re beginning to enjoy the benefits of our expanded customer base. Despite the continues little uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare marketplace, in fiscal 2011 Piccolo revenues increased 31% over the prior year, rotor revenues increased 14% and total sales increased 18%. I am pleased with that progress in 2011, our sales team continues to expand those skills and knowledge and as a result our productivity keeps increasing. And our marketing team continues to enhance our value proposition and find creative ways to communicate that value proposition to customers. Strong sales team and the persuasion of value proposition is a powerful combination. Going forward, we plan to expand our physician office sales force to 21 territories. The timing of this expansion will depend on hitting our productivity milestones and will be a stepwise process. We’ll also be adding 11 specialized sales professionals to focus exclusively on integrated delivery networks. The timing of this scale up will be tied to the early success implementing the marketing, the IND marketing models that we had developed. Back on to you Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you Brenton and with that, we’re open for questions."

Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you very much Joe, and good afternoon everybody. I will review the accomplishments and the challenges for our Q4 FY’12 and then our total year 2012 and then some of the goals for FY 2013. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, who is recently promoted to Chief Commercial Officer for the North American Animal Health Market and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of Sales and Marketing for the North American Medical Market to give an update on their respective businesses, and then we’ll take some questions. While we had record performance in Q4, we did have a few challenges. Our medical disc sales had about 565,000 units, light compared to last quarter and Q4 last year. We usually had lower medical disc sales in Q3 due to the fact that visits to the doctor drop off between Thanksgiving and New Year’s, and higher medical disc sales in Q4 as the business recover. This year, however, our Q3 came in at a new record up 14% over Q3 2011 and Q4 finished light, down 9% year-over-year at 14% quarter-over-quarter. Now the timing of distributor orders can affect the timing of sales and disc shipments. And for the year medical disc sales finished at a record 2.4 million units, up about 8%. Now total worldwide medical sales finished Q4 at 7.6 million up only 1% year-over-year and down 6% quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to lower government sales, which were down 19% compared to Q4 last year. For the year, medical sales finished at a new record $30.3 million, up 4%. Our domestic medical sales, excluding the government sales finished the year at $21 million, up about 9%. More to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. Our legal expenses tied to the FTC investigation of a competitor and the Cepheid patent suit costs us about $700,000 in Q4 and AVRL had an operating loss of about $1.2 million in Q4. For the year these legal expenses were about $2.7 million and the cost of expenses related to AVRL totaled about $ 4.9 million. Our other sales for Q4 2012 were about $350,000 lower compared to Q4 last year and for the year other sales were down about $1.8 million or down 28% due to lower royalties. But even with these challenges how we experienced record performance in Q4. Total sales finished at a record $42.7 million, up 14% year-over-year and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, sales totaled $156.6 million, up 9%. Worldwide Vet sales at $34.1 million were up 19% in Q4, compared to Q4 last year and up 20%, compared to last quarter. For the year, worldwide Vet sales totaled $121.8 million, up 12%, so a few records. We also had a record domestic sales of $35.4 million for Q4, up 16% year-over-year and up 11% quarter-over-quarter. For the year domestic sales totaled a $129 million, up 9%, also a new record. International sales for Q4 finished at $7.3 million up 21%, compared to last quarter and up 5%, compared to Q4 last year. Europe finished Q4 with sales of $5.6 million, recovering nicely from Q3s disappointing performance and was up 24% quarter-over-quarter and up 2% versus Q4 last year. For the year, European sales finished at a record $21.9 million, up about 8%. Pac-Rim sales totaled $1.7 million in Q4 FY’12 up 15% year-over-year and up 14% quarter-over-quarter. For the year, total Pac-Rim sales finished at $5.7 million, up 6%, also a new record. We have record Vet disc sales at 1.2 million units for Q4 up 27% quarter-over-quarter and 7% year-over- year. For FY 2012 Vet disc sales finished at 4.4 million units up about 4%. North American Vet disc grew about 7%, we will have more from Marty in a minute, in 2012 and Pac-Rim and government disc sales were flat and Europe was down 7% mostly due to lower disc sales in Q3 due to the fact that we added a Abaxis distribution center in Europe in October. Our total disc sales for Q4 amounted to 1.8 million units, also a record, but up only 1% year-over-year due to lower medical disc sales. Quarter-over-quarter general disc sales were up 11%. For the year total disc sales finished at 6.8 million units up 5%. Now in dollars, total disc sales for Q4 totaled $23.8 million up 6% year-over-year and up 17% quarter-over-quarter. For the year total disc sales finished at $87.7 million, up 8%. Other vet consumable revenue that include i-STAT and COAG cartridges, Rapid Test and hematology reagent packs finished Q4 2012 at a record $7 million, up 33% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over- quarter. For the year, other vet consumable sales totaled $26.1 million, up 22%, also a new record. Now we had record instrument sales as well in Q4 finishing at 1,212 instruments up 22% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter. For the year we sold a total of 4751 instruments up 9% versus last year. In Q4, we sold 456 VetScans versus 438 last quarter and 427 Q4 last year. For the year we sold a total of 1765 VetScans, up 9%. We sold 285 hematology instruments versus 226 Q4 last year and 245 last quarter. For the year, we sold 1042 hematology analyzers, up 4% versus last year. And we sold 264 Piccolos, including 10 sold to the government versus 173 Q4 last year and 226 last quarter. For the year we sold 830 Piccolos, up 8% compared to last year. And finally, we sold 370 i-Stat and COAG instruments versus 248 Q4 last year and 286 last quarter. For the year, we sold 1,114 i-Stat and COAG instruments up 16% compared to FY 2011. 23% of sales for the quarter were capital while 78% were consumables. This compares to 21/79 Q4 last year and 24/76 last quarter. For the year, the mix was 22/78. 17% of total sales were international sales while 83% were North America. This compares to 18/82 Q4 last year and 16/84 last quarter. For the year, the mix was 18/82. Now our disc or rotor average selling price hit a record $13.25, up $0.53 versus Q4 of last year and up $0.69 versus last quarter. Disc cost at $3.93 were down $0.45 versus Q4 last year and up $0.21 versus last quarter. Disc gross margin finished at 70%, up from 66% Q4 last year. For the year disc cost were down $0.23. And our gross profit for Q4 2012 was up 14% year-over-year and gross margins were up 20 basis points. Even though the margins in AVRL were negative and royalty income was down. For the year gross profit was up 70% - excuse me 7%, our gross margins were down about 120 basis points. Mostly due to the AVRL startup cost and lower royalty income. Operating expenses for Q4 finished at 39.7% of sales, an improvement over the 40.4% sales for Q4 of last year and the 41.9% of sales last quarter. Excluding the legal cost and cost associated with the startup of AVRL and the operating expenses for AVRL, we would have finished at 36.3% sales for Q4. Sales and marketing expenses for Q4 2012 finished at 26.2% of sales up from 24.3% of sales Q4 last year and flat with last quarter. For the year, sales and marketing expenses finished the year at 25.3% of sales up from 23.9% of sales last year. R&D expenses for Q4 at 7.4% of sales are up from 7.1% of sales Q4 last year and 7% of sales last quarter. For the year, R&D expenses finished at 7.8% of sales, down from 8.3% of sales last year. Admin expenses for Q4 of 6.1% of sales were down from 9% of sales Q4 last year and 8.7% of sales last quarter. For the year, admin expenses finished at 8.8% of sales versus 7.6% of sales last year. Operating income for Q4 finished at a record $6.4 million, up 22% year over year and 39% quarter over quarter. For the year operating income totaled $19.5 million, down from $22.5 million last year. Now, excluding the AVRL operations and the legal expenses tied to the Cepheid and the FTC investigation of a competitor, operating income would have finished at $26.4 million. Our pre-tax income for Q4 totaled around $6.9 million, up 21% year over year and up 52% quarter over quarter. For the year, pre-tax income totaled $20.2 million versus $23.6 million last year. Net income at $4.7 million for Q4, also a new record, and it was up 40% year over year and 65% quarter over quarter or $0.21 a share. For fiscal year 2012, net income totaled $13.1 million or $0.58 a share, down from $14.5 million or $0.64 a share from fiscal year 2011. Now, excluding the expenses from AVRL and the excess legal expenses discussed earlier, net income would have totaled $17.6 million or about $0.78 a share. On the R&D side of the business, we completed the development, submitted to the USDA and launched our Lyme Rapid Test. The Lactate test and the finger stick data on cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides have been submitted to the FDA. Hemoglobin and [indiscernible] development should be completed this quarter or next and the multi- cavity barcode ring and disc covered parts are being cut in the factory and once the inventory of all parts is completed, we should see the $0.20 disc reduction cost fully implemented. Our goals for Q1 and FY 2013 include keeping the focus on building our reference lab business. The trends continue to look very good so if we can keep this momentum going there’s an excellent chance of hitting our aggressive goals for this fiscal year. We could have some new distribution options for the U.S. for our Vet business, so we’ll be working on plans to take advantage of this new market coverage opportunity. The 2-by-2 program in the factory is also a priority for FY 2013, with the goal of continuing to reduce the costs of both our instruments and consumables. And we had 2 quarters with disc costs below $4 and now the goal is to achieve a cost below $3. Priorities in R&D are to finish the [indiscernible] Rapid Test, the Hemoglobin test, and shepherd our recent FDA submissions through the agency. In addition to that, R&D is supporting the 2-by-2 program, focusing on the validation of the new plastic parts and process improvements. So with that, Marty, you’re on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I’ll provide some additional detail surrounding the North American Animal Health core business and separately review our new AVRL divisions in the second quarter of operations. In our fourth quarter fiscal year 2012, North American Animal Health recorded record revenues in our core business of $27.8 million, up $4 million or 17% from the prior quarter and up year over year $4.6 million or 20%. Revenue inclusive of our AVRL division was $28.3 million, up $4.3 million or 18% from the prior quarter and, versus year ago, up $5.1 million or 22%. For the fiscal year, our core business generated a record 98.5% million in revenue up $11.3 million or 13%. Total revenue from North American Animal Health inclusive of our AVRL division was $99.1 million, up $11.9 million or 14% compared to FY 2011. As Clint mentioned, Abaxis previewed its lateral flow Lyme Rapid Test at the North American Veterinary Conference in January, launched and began taking orders at the Western States Conference in mid- February and began its first shipments late in March. The product has been well received and has created a lot of excitement as it is now the first and only single test rapid Lyme assay that can be performed in clinic in minutes. [indiscernible] been a control launch as we are still scaling up their manufacturing capacity in Union City and building inventory. Our instrument business at the clinic level was again very, very strong. Abaxis and its distributor partners combined for shipping in 905 instruments to clinics, up 17% in the same period year ago. This is only 36 units or 4% off our record third quarter. Much of this we attribute to the impact of our AVRL momentum. In the fourth quarter, 133 facilities purchased instruments in conjunction with an AVRL service agreement or program, 50 of which we were not previously doing business with. These 133 facilities accounted for 248 instruments sold and accounted for about 1.8 million in Q4 instrument revenue. This compared to last quarter where AVRL programs were a factor in 87 clinic transactions of which 56 for new customers for a total of 171 instruments and about 123 million in instrument revenue. Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories in the second whole quarter of operations generated revenue of $470,000. Compared to its first quarter of operations net sales increased 258%. Total acquisition grew 241% and the customer base increased 130%. To break this down a bit further, January net sales versus the prior month grew 43%, AVRL grew 61% in February versus January and we followed that with 67% growth in net sales March over February. So the growth continues to accelerate. In Q4, AVRL's first week of net sales versus the 13th week of the quarter grew approximately 237%. Total acquisitions grew 34% January versus December then to 51% February over January and then 65% March over February. AVRL is now servicing almost 1,000 veterinary clinics across all 50 states and the momentum continues to build. North American Animal Health commenced the fiscal year very strong, 22% for the quarter year-over- year. We have great products and great people. It’s an organization of individuals who are experienced, knowledgeable and skilled, full of energy, excited, motivated and tenacious. Despite the challenges faced everyday with very limited and, in fact, declining distribution in the U.S., everyone rolls up your sleeves and then contribute to the cause, that being to provide best diagnostic products and services to the veterinarian, so they in turn can provide the highest quality and most economical care for their clients with 73 million families in this country who own pets. To close, we had another record fiscal year and I’d like take this opportunity to thank all the employees of Abaxis, for all that you could do and I’m very proud to work alongside each of you. And with that I’ll turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you Marty. Okay. Brenton, you’re next. Brenton G. A. Hanlon Former Vice President of Medical Sales & Marketing for North America Thanks Clint, and good afternoon everyone. Q4 is typically a difficult quarter for instrument sales because many physicians purchase capital equipment in Q3 to take advantage of the tax credit. Even so, in Q4 of 2012, our instrument sales were very strong. In total, we sold 163 Piccolo’s, which represents a year-over-year increase of 57% and a quarter-over- quarter increase of 22%. After a record third quarter, Q4 rotor sales were lower than expected at $3.7 million, a decline of 9% year-over-year and a 13% decline quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to the timing of distributor orders. Total Q4 sales were up 7% year-over-year, but down 6% quarter-over- quarter. And for the year instrument revenues were 14% higher than fiscal year 2011, rotors ended up 7% higher, and overall sales were 9% higher than fiscal year 2011. The uncertainty surrounding the future direction of healthcare continues to depress sales of capital equipment to physician-owned offices and clinics. But we believe our value proportion of real-time actionable information, patient convenience and practice efficiency continues to gain traction. In particular, our message of real time laboratory test information continues to resonate whether it’s in care clinics, and depend on fast patient turnaround. We are enjoying good growth in this market and currently have 577 urgent care customers and are in advance discussions with some larger urgent care chains. In fact, we recently attended the Urgent Care Association of American Convention and we’re pleased to learn that the Piccolo is now considered to be the standard of care for urgent care centers. Primary care continues to be the focus of our physician office sales organization and in addition to the 577 urgent care customers, we now have a 1,180 internal medicine customers. We’re also making headway with our new IDN initiative. In Q4, our second IDN account purchased the first Piccolo of a plan rollout and we expect to close IDN account number 3 any day now. In addition, 6 IDNs are purchased to Piccolo for the purpose of the product evaluation and the pilot testing in the satellite clinics. Regarding the large retail clinic chain that has been discussed previously, the customers continuing to run the Piccolo on selected sites and we’re working closely together with them to move the deal forward. In summary, the fourth quarter was quite a successful one for the U.S. medical team as we continue to make progress on all fronts. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Yes. Thank you very much, Brenton. And with that, we’ll open for questions."

With that having been said, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Joe and good afternoon, everybody. I will spend a few minutes here to review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q1 FY13 and then some of the goals for Q2. After my short presentation, I'll ask Marty Mulroy, the Chief Commercial Officer for North American Animal Health and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of Sales and Marketing from North American Medical market to give an update on their respective businesses. And then we will take some questions. Now one of the major challenges for Q1 was government sales which were down 32% versus Q1 last year with lower sales to the military, the main reason. Our Piccolo instrument sales to the government in units were down 35% and disks were down 28%, compared in Q1 last year. While non-government Piccolo disk sales were up 2% versus Q1 last year. Total worldwide Piccolo disk sales at 551,000 units were down about 2% compared to Q1 FY2012. Now on the debt side of our business we continue to scale up our sales and marketing team. We hired 17 additional field people along the three in-house support folks. This brings our domestic team in the field to about 93 people. This expansion of market coverage in Q1 should produce some excellent results as we hit our goals for this current fiscal year. More from Marty here in a few minutes. Our total legal expenses in Q1 were about 850,000, which majority was due to the Cepheid litigation. Again the negative gross margins for AVRL in Q1 was about 620,000. While these expenses impacted earnings in Q1, we believe we should get good returns for the rest of our fiscal year. Even with these challenges we finished Q1 FY13 with sales of $42 million up 17% versus Q1 last year. Total worldwide vet sales finished the quarter at $32.5 million up 17% year-over-year, but down about 5% over last quarters record levels. Worldwide medical sales totaled $8.4 million a new record up 18% year- over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter helped by a $1.6 million in sales to our new CRO account. We also have had record international sales for Q1 ‘13, totaling $8.9 million up 41% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter. European sales at $7.2 million were up 39% helped by the $1.6 million order from our new CRO customer. I’d also like to note that 417,000 of this order was shipped to North America. Pac Rim sales for the quarter totaled $1.6 million up 47% versus Q1 last year. Total North American sales finished the quarter at $33.2 million up 12% versus Q1 last year with domestic sales at $26.5 million and they were up 18% compared to Q1 last year. More to follow from Marty in a few minutes. Domestic medical sales totaled $5.1 million up 5% versus Q1 last year, and included $417,000 sales to our new CRO customer, that was reported under European sales. More to follow from Brenton in a few minutes. Vet disc sales at 1.2 million units for Q1 were up 16% year-over-year, but down 3% quarter-over-quarter. Now in dollars, Vet disc sales totaled $18.7 million, up 20% year-over-year but down about 1% quarter- over-quarter. Total disc sales for the quarter at $1.7 million units went up 9% year-over-year and down about 3% quarter-over-quarter and in dollars total disc sales for Q1 totaled $23.6 million, up 14% year- over-year, but down 1% over last quarter’s record. Other Vet consumable revenues that include i-STAT, coag cartridges, Rapid Test and hematology reagent packs finished Q1 ‘13 had at $5.9 million, down about 2% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to lower hematology reagent sales. We had a price increase on hematology reagent packs effective April 1 as some of the distributors increased their orders last quarter. Instrument sales in Q1 finished strong at 1,303 instruments, up 28% year-over-year or 286 instruments, but down about 1% or 9 instruments quarter-over-quarter. In dollars, instrument sales finished Q1 at $9.9 million, up 31% versus Q1 last year. In the quarter, we sold 446 Vet camps versus 367 Q1 last year and 456 last quarter. We sold 233 hematology instruments versus 250 Q1 last year and 285 last quarter. We sold 324 Piccolos, including 15 sold to the government versus 172 Q1 last year and 264 last quarter. 157 Piccolos were sold to our new CRO customer. And finally, we sold 300 i-STAT and COAG instruments versus 228 in Q1 last year and 307 last quarter. Now 24% of the sales for the quarter were capital sales while 76 were consumable and others, this compares to 21/79, Q1 last year and 23/77 last quarter. 21% of total sales were international sales while 79% were North America. This compares to 17/83 Q1 last year and 17/83 last quarter. 20% of total sales were medical sales and 77 were Vet sales and 3% other. This compares with 20/77/3 Q1 last year and 18/80/2 last quarter. Disk average selling price hit a record $13.55, up $0.54 versus Q1 last year, and up $0.30 versus last quarter. Disk cost at $3.89 were down $0.09 versus Q1 last year and down $0.04 versus last quarter. Disk gross margin finished at a record 71%, up from 69% Q1 last year. Gross profit for Q1’13 was up 19% year-over-year, and gross margins were up 100 basis points versus Q1 last year, even though the margins in AVRL were negative. Operating expenses for Q1 finished at 43% of sales down 150 basis points versus Q1 last year, and higher than the 39.7% of sales last quarter. Higher sales and marketing costs due to the expansion of Vet team are the main reasons for this increase. Sales and marketing expenses for Q1’13 finished at 28% of sales up from 25.4% of sales in Q1 last year, and 26.2% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses for Q1 at 7.1% of sales are down from 9.6% of sales Q1 last year, but up from 7.4% of sales last quarter. And admin expenses for Q1 at 7.9% of sales were down from 8% of sales Q1 last year, but up from 6.1% of sales last quarter. Operating income for Q1 finished at $4.8 million, up 50% year-over-year, but down 26% quarter-over- quarter, mostly due to higher sales and marketing costs. If we exclude the losses at AVRL, and the legal charges from [indiscernible] suit, operating income would have finished at $7.2 million. Pre-tax income for Q1 was negatively effected by $400,000 of currency losses and totaled $4.6 million, up 31% year-over-year, but down 34% quarter-over-quarter. Net income at $2.9 million for Q1 was up 29% compared to Q1 last year or $0.13 of share, which was up 30% compared to $0.10 of share Q1 last year. Now excluding the expenses for AVRL and the excess legal expenses discussed earlier, net income would have totaled $4.4 million or about $0.20 of share. Now on the R&D side of the business, we completed the Outline of Production for [indiscernible] and submitted it to the USDA. The laboratory [ph] test without the FDA and the hemoglobin development should be completed this quarter or next. A multi-cavity barcode ring and disk cover parts are being cut in the factory, once the inventory of all parts is depleted, we should see the $0.20 cost reduction in the factory. Our goals for Q2 include keeping the focus on building our Vet reference lab business. The trends continue to look very good so if we can keep this momentum going, we have an excellent chance of getting our aggressive goals this fiscal year. We should have some new distribution options in the U.S. for our Vet business, so we will continue working on plans to take advantage of this new market coverage opportunity. On the medical side of our business, we are working on sizing the clinical research opportunity for the Piccolo and initial indications are this could be a large market and there could be good demand for point- of-care solutions. We will be working very hard in making sure our current customer gets the support they need to make our first sales in this market a success in a model from the future. The two by two program in the factory continues to be a priority for the rest of FY ‘13 with a goal of continuing to reduce cost of both our instruments and consumables. We now have three quarters with disc sales below $4 and now the goal is to achieve cost below $3. Priorities in R&D are to finish the Giardia [ph] Rapid Test submission and hemoglobin test. In addition, R&D is supporting the two by two program focusing on the validation of the new plastic parts and other process improvements. So, with that, Martin, you are on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I’ll provide some additional details surrounding the North American Animal Health core business and review our AVRL division, it’s now third quarter of operation. In our first quarter fiscal year 2013, North American Animal Health recorded revenues in our core business of $25.6 million, up year-over-year $3.2 million or 14%. Revenue inclusive of our AVRL division was $26.5 million, up $4.1 million or 18% growth versus year ago. Our instrument business at the clinical level was again very strong. Abaxis and its distributor partners combined for shipping 821 instruments to clinics, up 19% from the same period year ago. Much of this, we attribute to the impact for their continued AVRL momentum, combined with the continued investment in U.S. and Canada field sales and field sales support. 124 facilities purchased instruments in conjunction with an AVRL service agreements or AVRL program, 49 of which we were not previously doing business with. These 124 facilities accounted for 200 instruments sold and accounted for a $1.6 million in Q1 instruments revenues. Abaxis Veterinary Reference Laboratories in its third full quarter of operations generated revenue of over $860,000 compared to the prior quarter of operations net sales increased 83%. Total acquisitions grew by 82% and the customer base has now increased to 1,115 customers across all 50 states. Other North American Animal Health highlights include a record number of i-STAT instruments placed at a 145, i-STAT instrument revenue up 48% from year ago. The [indiscernible] revenue was up 31% versus year ago and Vetscan VS2 revenue was up 19% versus a year ago. Additionally, [indiscernible] revenue was up 22% or $2.7 million from year ago. Our investment in infrastructure in the U.S. and Canada continues to pay off and we believe the stage is set for continued double-digit growth through all of FY’13. Once again, I would like to thank and congratulate the North American Animal Health team for another good quarter. Strong revenue growth and I look forward to continued momentum across the entire organization. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you Marty. And with that Brenton, you are next. Brenton G. A. Hanlon Former Vice President of Medical Sales & Marketing for North America Thanks, Clint and good afternoon everyone. Our major challenge for Q1 was [indiscernible] sales, which were down 5% year-over-year. The root cause was inadequate account management on the part of some of our distributors. The Abaxis sales team is focused on acquiring new customers and we depend on our distributors to ensure that our existing customers are fully utilizing the Piccolos. And while we recognize that current market conditions are difficult and there is a breakdown in distributor follow-up in Q1. This is the first time we have experienced a year-over-year decline in [indiscernible] sales and we have responded quickly by working closely with our distributors to increase the level of account management and we expect to see an impact in Q2. On the positive side, in Q1, we were able to close our first CRO project. Sometime ago, we recognized that real time clinical information provided by the Piccolo may help reduce the time and cost of clinical drug trials. And in Q1, 157 Piccolos were shipped for drug study, for clinical trials around the world. The balance of an estimated total of 300 Piccolos for this study will ship in Q2 and Q3. Including consumables, the total revenues for this particular study will be approximately $4 million. Going forward, we plan to expand our CRO activities and what we believe will be over time, a significant new area for Abaxis. In Q1, we placed 147 Piccolos in the U.S., of which 43 were associated with the clinical trial. This represents a 48% increase over the corresponding quarter of last year. Once again, Piccolos sales to urgent care centers were strong at 29 units. Piccolos is an excellent tool to assist urgent care physicians with a rapid patient turnaround. We now have 606 urgent care customers and expect to close another large chain in Q2. In Q1, we sold 32 instruments to primary care physicians reflecting, we believe a greater emphasis on patient wellness. We now have 1,212 primary care accounts. Additionally, our activities in the IDM market continue to show results. In Q1 a new IDM account purchase 16 Piccolos and an existing customer added two more bringing their total to 24. Going forward, we plan to better manage our current customer base, while at the same time expanding sales to physician offices in IDMs, as well as increasing our business with wellness companies and CROs. Bringing actionable real time diagnostic information to the medical system requires innovation and commitment, and at Abaxis we have the fine team of energetic and creative people who are up to the challenge. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, very good. Okay now, we’ll open to questions."

With that having said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I’ll spend a few minutes here and review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q1 FY14 and then some of the goals for Q2. And then after my short presentation, I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, our Chief Commercial Officer for North American Animal Health, and Rick Betts, our Director of Marketing for the North American Medical market to give an update on their respected businesses. Yes, one of the major challenges in Q1 was working through our transition for mostly direct sales, especially instruments, to working with partners MWI and Abbott. The processes are different and this change in market coverage means our focus of our sales and marketing people is to work more with our partners instead of mostly working directly with our customers. While MWI is doing an excellent job with sales up quarter-over-quarter from 3 quarters, our smaller distributors are experiencing slower growth as our direct sales force has more time with the MWI team and less time with our smaller partners. MWI has also picked up business from their customers that were previously buying Abaxis’s consumables from other distributors prior to January of this year, when our distribution went into effect. While we believe this movement from one distributor to the other is mostly complete, this change has led to some of our smaller partners to see lower sales and to more conservatively manage their inventory build, which led to slower sales of some of Abaxis products this quarter, both year-over-year and quarter- over-quarter. As our sales and marketing team becomes both more proficient in working through distributors and gets more experience with MWI, we’ll allot more time to working with our smaller partners and expect overall sales performance per rep to improve, which will result in higher sales per salesperson and lower marketing and selling costs as a percentage of sales to Abaxis. Even with these challenges, our worldwide Vet sales grew by 12% compared to Q1 last year to finish at $36 million, and more from Marty in a few minutes. Now while Abbott is doing a good job of integrating the Piccolo into their organization, they still don’t sell as many Piccolos as our direct team did. Their performance continues to improve and we expect that over the next couple of quarters, we’ll see Piccolo sales surpass the performance we had with our direct team, and more to follow-up from Rick in a few minutes. Our Q1 last year, we closed our first CRO account, which totaled about $1.6 million in medical sales, mostly instrument sales. While we are focused on closing our second account with 2 Abaxis’s people working on 4 potential products, this is yet to materialize leading to difficult comparisons year-over- year for our Medical business. While our expectations for Q1 met our internal forecast, our total medical sales were down 29% compared to Q1 last year due to lower Piccolo instrument sales, which totaled 126 instruments for Q1 this year versus 324 Q1 last year. Piccolo sales, however, were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter finishing Q1 2014 at 580,000 units versus 551,000 Q1 last year and 541,000 last quarter, that’s 541,000 last quarter. Over the next couple of quarters, we expect to close new CRO accounts, which along with the continued improvement of Abbott’s performance should lead to higher medical sales in the following quarters. These challenges also negatively affected our gross margin, which went from 54.4% Q1 of last year to 48.4% Q1 this year. Sales mix, that is, higher sales and lower margin other Vet consumables, Vet instruments, and AVRL lab services contributed to our lower gross margins. In addition, we have lower gross margins with our medical products sold to Abbott. And sales to the CRO market last year had significantly higher gross margin than medical sales to other markets. Now even with these challenges we finished Q1 2014 with modest growth in sales of $43.2 million, up 3% versus Q1 last year. Domestic Vet sales finished the quarter at $29.5 million, up 11% year-over-year, but down about 18% over last quarter’s record levels. More from Marty in a few minutes. As I indicated before, we have worldwide medical sales that totaled $6 million Q1 this year and we are down 29% year-over-year mostly due to lower instrument sales. We did have strong international sales for Q1 FY2014, totaling $8.5 million and excluding the CRO deal closed Q1 last year, international sales were up 17% versus Q1 last year and up 6% quarter-over-quarter. European sales at $6.6 million were up 17%, excluding that $1.6 million CRO deal we closed Q1 last year. And if you include the CRO deal, European sales were down about 9%. Pacific Rim sales for the quarter totaled $2 million, up 20% versus Q1 last year and up 5% versus last quarter. Earlier this month, we received clearance from the Chinese FDA to market our Piccolo products in China. This has been a multi-year project with a lot of complexities and we are now working with Abbott on a plan to start selling in China. While some market segments in certain provinces have reimbursements that are not attractive, others appear to have rates that are more conducive to our Point-of-Care solution. We believe this is a great opportunity for Abaxis and we’re looking forward to working with Abbott to finalize the plan for our focus launched sometime this fiscal year. Now total North American sales finished Q1 at $34.7 million and were up 4% versus Q1 last year. Domestic medical sales totaled $3.7 million and were down about 21% year-over-year and 13% quarter- over-quarter mostly due to lowered Piccolo instrument sales to Abbott, more to follow from Rick in a few minutes. Vet disc sales at 1.2 million units for Q1 were down 2% year-over-year and down 20% quarter-over- quarter, mostly due to lowered disc sales to our smaller distributors. In dollars, Vet disc sales totaled $18.3 million, also down about 2% versus Q1 last year. Total disc sales for Q1 totaled 1.7 million units and were flat year-over-year and down about 13% quarter- over-quarter, due to lower disc sales to our smaller Vet distributors. In dollars, total disc sales for Q1 totaled $22.8 million, down 3% year-over-year and 16% over last quarter’s record. Other Vet consumable revenues that include i-STAT and COAG Cartridges, rapid test and hematology reagent packs finished Q1 2014 at $7.8 million and were up 32% versus Q1 last year. Instrument sales in Q1 finished at 1,229 instruments, down from 1,303 instruments Q1 last year, mostly due to lower Piccolo instrument sales. In Q1, we sold 475 VetScans versus 446 Q1 last year and 473 last quarter. We sold 271 hematology instruments versus 233 Q1 last year and 341 last quarter. And as I mentioned before, 126 Piccolo instruments versus 324 Q1 last year and 183 last quarter. And finally, we sold 357 i-STAT and COAG instruments versus 300 Q1 last year and 488 last quarter. AVRL sales totaled $2.2 million, up 157% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter, with losses down both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. 20% of the sales for the quarter were capital, while 80 were consumable and other; this compares with 24.76% Q1 last year and 21.79% last quarter. 20% of total sales were international sales, while 80% North America. This compares with 21.79% Q1 last year and 16.84% last quarter. 14% of sales were medical sales and 84% were Vet sales and 2% other. This compares with 20.782% Q1 last year 13.861% last quarter. The disc average selling price for Q1 this year came in at $13.08 down $0.47 versus Q1 last year, and down $0.45 versus last quarter, due to lowered Vet disc sales. Disc costs for the quarter came in at $3.90 up $0.01 versus Q1 last year and $0.14 last quarter, also due to lower volume. Disc gross margin finished at 70%, down from 71% last year. As I mentioned before, gross margin finished both lowered quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, finishing the quarter at 48.4% versus 54.4% Q1 last year and 52.4% last quarter, mostly due to sales mix. Operating expenses for Q1 2014 totaled $16.3 million, down 10% year-over-year or 37.7% of sales, down 530 basis points versus Q1 last year, but higher than the 34.4% of sales last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses for Q1 2014 at $10 million or 23.2% of sales, were down from 28% of sales Q1 last year, but up from 22.6% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses for Q1 at $3.2 million or 7.4% of sales were up 7.1% of sales Q1 last year and up from 6.5% of sales last quarter. Admin expenses for Q1 at $3.1 million, or 7.1% of sales, were down from 7.9% of sales Q1 last year, but up from 5.3% of sales last quarter. Operating income for Q1 finished at $4.6 million, down 3% year-over-year and 48% quarter-over-quarter mostly due to lower gross margin and lower sales due to product mix. Our pretax income for Q1 totaled $5 million, up 10% year-over-year, but down 44% quarter-over-quarter. Net income for Q1 2014 at $3.2 million was up 13% year-over-year but was down 52% compared to last quarter, and finished at $0.14 a share of $0.01 compared to $0.13 a share Q1 last year. Now in the R&D side of the business, we have [indiscernible] in clinical trials that expect to submit to the USDA sometime next month. The other rapid tests are on schedule and be completed over the next 2 quarters. We have an agreement in principle with the partner that has the technology, we believe will allow us to produce high sensitivity immunoassays on our discs. Our attorneys are working on the details of the contract and once this is completed, we’ll start the feasibility work in the lab. Also, Q2 include working with our smaller distributors to up their performance was still keeping a focus on making sure the momentum built with MWI stays positive. This is clearly our number one objective for Q2. We need to keep the focus on our AVRL business, the trends look very good, and if we keep this momentum going, we have an excellent chance of hitting our aggressive sales goals and profitably this fiscal year. Now completing the development of our rapid test product line getting approval, then launching will be important to meeting our aggressive sales and margin goals for the fiscal year. On the medical side of our business, we’re working on 4 clinical research opportunities for the Piccolo, and we continue to focus on helping Abbott close Piccolo deals and expect Abbott’s sales to grow throughout the year. And on the retail side of our medical business, we’re close to closing our first PO for a pilot that includes instruments and discs, and we’ll hear more about this from Rick Betts in a few minutes. With that, Marty, you're on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Great. Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I’ll provide some additional colors of adding the North American Animal Health business. The U.S. business is transitioning from primarily what is a very challenging direct sales effort combined with working alongside local and regional distributors, holding an aggregate less than 10% market share. Today, in the U.S., there is less of a direct sales effort and we have moved to more of a traditional distributor model with the addition of a national distributor, MWI itself having about 30% market share in the U.S. We are now 2 quarters into the transition, and while this past quarter’s revenue of $29.6 million and 11%, or $3 million in revenue year-over-year growth, may have been disappointing to us, it’s still a very, very exciting time this year and the future looks incredibly bright. The markets here are taking place, in Iraq through local and regional distributors are making inventory adjustments in response, but again, we're generally fully engaged now. We’re working hard with those distributors to get and back to their prior after door sales levels and records of purchase levels, and most again, most will contribute to our historically consistent double-digit growth. Meanwhile, MWI continued to rapidly ramp up in the sales of the Abaxis products line: instruments; associated reagents; and rapid tests. And currently, our national account GPO business is beginning to trend up nicely with organization such as the association and Zoos and Aquariums, the Humane Society of the United States and others, and discussions are taking place with several other potentially significant national account opportunities. I’m also pleased to report Canada is now tracking at a $10 million business for us. In addition to the 11% year-over-year growth in revenue and other highlights from our first quarter fiscal year 2014 include: instrumental revenue up 18%; hematology reagent sales up 32%; Rapid Tests sales up year-over-year at 61%; and as Clint mentioned, AVRL our commercial lab business, up 157% versus a year ago. Again, AVRL with net revenue of $2.2 million, up 22% or 400,000 in the prior quarter is marching towards profitability and soon to be a $10 million annual business segment for Abaxis. Additionally, last quarter of 194 facilities combined insulin purchases with one or more of our AVRL programs, accounting for 278 instruments, and $2.1 in instrument revenue. Finally, I want to touch on some more innovational changes in the North American Animal Health business units. With the departure of our director of sales in late May, we have promoted Jeff Sumpters, and Manager U.S. Distribution to National Sales Manager overseeing our first line of sales managers in the U.S. Tom Beaver, our National Accounts Manager and John Therrien, Country Manager for Canada, all now reports directly to me, flattening somewhat the North American sales organization. With a coming soon of 4 new rapid assays, significant opportunity abound for organic growth and are continuing to take market share. We continue to be very well poised for capitalizing on quality opportunities that lie ahead of us in the U.S. and Canada. And with that, I will turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Marty. Okay, now I would like to introduce Rick Betts, our Marketing Director for Medical. Rick, you are on. Rick Betts Former Director of Medical Sales & Marketing - Medical Diagnostics Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon all. For the quarter, the Domestic and Medical division finished with revenues of $3.71 million. The quarters yielded 109 Piccolo replacements and 447,000 reagent discs sold by Abbott for distribution in the U.S. POL market. The Abbott team continues to grow in a knowledge and efficacy of selling and marketing the Piccolo and they are coming up to speed with the sales traction. We expect the growth to continue as their team gains more experience with our product in the coming quarters. In Canada, we successfully completed an extensive evaluation with Canadian Medical Laboratories, one of the nation’s largest laboratory service providers. Additionally, the interest in Piccolo use continues to grow in the regional provincial hospitals, physician offices, and retail pharmacies throughout Canada. With the clinical trials initiative, we signed a key distribution agreement with MESM, a U.K. clinical trial equipment supplier. With this partnership, the impressive clinical trials pipeline continues to accelerate with multiple pilots in the planning stages. The clinical trials team is on track to meet its revenue projections for the fiscal year. And finally, as Clint mentioned earlier, we reached an agreement with CDS to begin an extensive pilot of Piccolo technology across an entire area of mini clinic sites. While we cannot discuss the details of the pilot, this is the second major step we’ve taken together and it does lead to national rollout. There is also proof that Piccolo was reaching its potential to improve the efficacy of care in this new healthcare environment. We are excited to be working with CDS, and we believe that with the Piccolo, mini clinic is well positioned to handle the influx of patients who are about to hit the primary care market in early 2014, when Obamacare kicks in. Thank you. And I will turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you very much, Rick. And with that, we are open to questions."

Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I’ll review some of the accomplishments and challenges for Q2 of FY 2013 and then some of the goals for Q3. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Martin Mulroy, our Chief Commercial Officer of North American Animal Health Sales and Marketing and Brenton Hanlon, our VP of North American Medical Sales and Marketing to give an update on their respective businesses. We’ll then take questions. Our challenges for Q2 included a change in product mix that resulted in record instrument sales and lower disc sales when compared to Q2 last year and last quarter. For those who follow Abaxis closely, you may remember last year we shipped 2 containers of Vet discs to Europe in Q2 FY’12 versus one container in Q1, Q3 and Q4. Demand for Vet discs from Europe prior to our setting up our own warehouse in Germany in Q3 last year was 5 containers a year, and because the fifth container shipped in Q2 last year, we sold about $1.5 million more in Vet discs in Q2 than we did in Q1, Q3 and Q4. So comparisons for Europe Q2 this year was difficult due to the 2-container shipment. Each container holds about 110,000 discs. Another challenge was government sales that totaled $612,000 for Q2 FY’13 and were down about 48% year-over-year and 16% quarter-over-quarter mostly due to lower sales to the military. Now with the announcement last quarter that Abaxis had a potential opportunity to partner with one of the 3 leading Vet distributors in the U.S., our smaller partners decided this new potential competition could negatively affect their disc volume. So last quarter they adjusted their disc orders down when compared to Q1, ’13. Now we believe that disc volume will adjust up over the next 2 quarters as our market coverage improves in Q4 and we’ll have some more from Marty in a few minutes on that subject. Now while AVRL sales continue to grow, and they were up 26% quarter-over-quarter, over $1 million, our gross margins are still negative as we scale up the operation. The gross margins for Q2, ’13 were negative by about $810,000, up from a negative of $620,000 last quarter. And we believe we now have enough infrastructure in place and expect better performance from AVRL in Q3 and Q4. We settled the Cepheid patent suit in Q2 with an agreement that covered our legal costs. Now while this settlement is reported as other income, reported operating expenses do include those legal costs. Now while we were managing distractions and complexities in Q2, we still had a record quarter finishing at $44.3 million, up 11% versus Q2 last year and up 5% compared to last quarter. We sold a record 1,567 instruments Q2 ‘13, up 28% or 340 instruments compared to Q2 last year and up 20% or 264 instruments compared to last quarter. In dollars, instrument sales were up 33% compared to Q2 last year. We sold 572 VetScans, a new record versus 504 Q2 last year and 446 last quarter. We sold 372 hematology instruments, also a new record, compared to 262 Q2 last year and 233 last quarter. We also sold 259 Piccolos including 8 to the government versus 168 Q2 last year and 324 last quarter. And finally, we sold 364 i-STAT and coag instruments versus 293 last year and 300 last quarter. Now worldwide Vet sales finished Q2 ‘13 at a record $34.9 million, up 11% year-over-year and 8% quarter- over-quarter. North American Vet sales for the quarter were also at record levels, finishing at $28.8 million, up 17% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter and we’ll get more from Marty in a few minutes. North American sales for Q2 totaled $35.9 million, up 12% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter, also a new record. Total worldwide medical sales finished Q2 at $7.9 million, up 7% versus Q2 last year, but down 6% over last quarter’s record levels. International sales finished Q2 at $8.3 million, up 4% year-over-year despite the difficult comparisons, but down 6% quarter-over-quarter. Last quarter we had about $1.6 million in sales shipped from Europe to our new CRO account and this quarter it was about $717,000. Total disc sales at 1.7 million units were down 6% compared to Q2 last year, mostly due to the difficult comparisons in Europe and down 4% over last quarter mostly due to our domestic Vet distributors adjusting their inventory levels. In dollars, disc sales finished Q2 at $22 million, down 4% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter. Total Vet disc sales at 1.1 million units were down 7% year-over-year due to lower sales in Europe and down 9% quarter-over-quarter. In dollars, Vet disc sales finished just under $17 million, down 3% year- over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter. Now other Vet consumable sales that include rapid tests, i-STAT, coag cartridges and hematology reagents finished Q2 ’13 at a record $7.4 million, up 12% year-over-year and 26% quarter-over-quarter. Medical disc sales totaled 578,000 units, up 5% quarter-over-quarter, but down 4% year-over-year mostly due to lower government sales. 18% of total sales were medical, 79% were Vet and 3% other. This compares with 18, 79, 3 Q2 last year and 20, 77, 3 last quarter. 26% of sales were capital sales and 74% consumable. This compares with 22, 78 Q2 last year and 24, 76 last quarter. 19% of total sales were international while 81% were domestic and this compares with 20, 80 Q2 last year and 21, 79 last quarter. Now the disc average selling price finished Q2 at $13.21 up $0.27 year-over-year but down $0.34 quarter- over-quarter. Disc cost at $3.87 was down $0.14 year-over-year and down $0.02 quarter-over-quarter. Disc gross margin finished at 71% up 200 basis points year-over-year and about the same as last quarter. Now our mix of higher sales of lower margin instruments and lower sales of higher margin discs along with record sales from lower margin OEM products pressured our gross profit which finished Q2 at $23.1 million up 5% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Gross margin for Q2 at 52.2% was down about 280 basis points year-over-year and down about 220 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Now as we see improvements in our sales mix going forward, the continued success of our 2-by-2 program [ph] and the improvements in AVRL we should see margins expanding in Q3 and Q4. Now operating expenses, excluding the patent settlement and adjusting for bonuses and profit sharing due to the reimbursement of our legal expenses, finished the quarter at $17 million or 38.5% of sales which is down from 42% of sales Q2 last year and 43% of sales last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses for Q2, ‘13 including the adjustments for bonuses and profit sharing, totaled $10.9 million or 24.7% of sales, up from 23.3% of sales Q2 of last year, but down from 28% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses for Q2 including the adjustments for bonuses and profit sharing finished at $3.4 million or 7.8% of sales, up from 7.5% of sales, Q2 last year and 7.1% of sales last quarter. Now administration expenses including the adjustment for bonuses and legal fees reflected in the settlement, totaled $2.7 million or 6% of sales and down from 8.4% of sales Q2 last year, and 7.9% of sales last quarter. Operating earnings after adjustments for legal expenses, bonuses and profit sharing for Q2, FY 2013 totaled $6,533,000, up 26% year-over-year and 36% quarter-over-quarter. Net income after adjustments totaled $4,116,000 or $0.18 a share, up from $0.15 a share Q2 last year and up from $0.13 a share last quarter. Now on the R&D side of the business, we continue to make progress on our Ehrlichia rapid test submission which was slowed due to difficulties in finding positive samples. We now have some of the samples we need and expect to acquire the rest this quarter and if successful we may able to submit to the USDA sometime next quarter. We have also started the development of Anaplasma and 2 other rapid tests for the Vet market. We continue to focus our hemoglobin test development on scaling up the manufacturing process. Meeting our tight design goals for this product has been a challenge, but we are making good progress and should have it completed by next quarter. Now goals for Q3 include training and achieving the pre-launch goals for a successful start with our relationship with MWI. This is an opportunity to significantly expand our market coverage and help us build sales momentum going in to Q4 and FY2014. We need to keep the 2-by-2 program [ph] on track as well as the development projects for hemoglobin and Ehrlichia. We'll also be focusing our attention on efficiency improvements at AVRL and believe if we can stay on this growth curve, operating losses should start to go down significantly. Now before I introduce Marty, I would like to let everybody know that I’ll probably be doing some tax planning this quarter and there is a possibility I could exercise some stock options which would require me to sell some shares to cover the options and the taxes. So with that, Marty, you are on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Great, thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks, I will provide some additional details surrounding the North American Animal Health business. In our second quarter fiscal year 2013, including government, North American Animal Health recorded record revenues of $28.5 million, up year-over-year at 17%, an increase of over $4 million, versus our Q1 revenue was up 8% or over $2 million. As Clint mentioned, AVRL contributed 1.1 million to the revenue at commercial laboratory business, tracking now already at a $4.4 million business. And again, this is up 26% from the prior quarter. Total [indiscernible] sales in unit were flat versus year ago, but in dollars up 5%. This was again due to some distributors reducing inventory levels in anticipation of some new competition from MWI for both existing and new business. The balance of reagents and consumables was up double-digits, in dollars 11% versus a year ago. Our instrument business was once again very strong; we shipped a record 983 instruments, over $7 million in revenue, also a record and up 33% from year ago. This included a record 378 VS2 instruments, while the ASP for the VS2 was up 15% versus year ago. Much of this we attribute to the impact of our AVRL momentum combined with continued investment in U.S. and Canada field sales and field sales support. Meanwhile, we are preparing for the January 2 launch of MWI as a new distributor partner who we believe will add considerable incremental value to our sales and marketing efforts. I would like to congratulate and once again thank the North American Animal Health team for another great quarter of strong revenue growth and we look forward to the continued momentum and future contributions from the entire organization. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you, Marty. Okay, Brenton, you’re next. Brenton G. A. Hanlon Former Vice President of Medical Sales & Marketing for North America Thanks, Clint, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, maintaining rotor sales levels continued to be our major near-term challenge. With improved account management, second quarter rotor revenues did post a 6% increase over Q1 of this year. We believe there is still room for us to improve our account management. In Q2, we sold 141 instruments, which is a record for a second quarter. This is a testament to the ever-increasing efficiency and skill of our sales people, and indicates that our revised value proposition continues to resonate. Also in Q2, we continued to expand beyond our traditional independent physicians’ office market. We have identified 5 areas where customers place a premium on real-time information. The first area is corporate loaners. Our largest customer in this sector is preparing for a national rollout, and in Q2 we finalized a 10-year, $5.9 million rotor agreement. This company currently deploys 40 Piccolos. Secondly, concierge medicine [indiscernible] continues to be a very attractive market for Abaxis. Our largest concierge [indiscernible] customer has accelerated their national rollout and in Q2 opened 10 additional centers. They now have a total of 59 Piccolos. The third area is urgent care change. In Q2, our largest urgent care customer opened 3 additional clinics, bringing their total number of Piccolos to 53. The fourth area is standalone emergency care centers; these centers compete with hospital emergency rooms and began opening in Texas the past year or 2. To date we have sold 60 Piccolos in the standalone emergency care centers, which represent about 90% penetration of the Texas market. In Texas a chemistry analyzer is mandatory for these centers and currently the Piccolo is the only system in the formulary, so we expect to see continued growth in this emerging market. Finally our newest initiative outside of the physician office is the clinical research market. If you recall, in Q1 of this fiscal year the U.S. medical team closed our first CRO project. In Q2 this customer contributed $720,000 in worldwide revenues, which is in addition to the $1.6 million posted in Q1. This brings the current fiscal year worldwide total to $2.3 million for this first customer. Of the $2.3 million, $510,000 were shipped to the U.S. and Canada, while the balance was shipped to various European countries. In our traditional physician office space, Piccolos into primary care set the pace with 46 additional units, bringing the total number of primary care placements to 1,258. Urgent care centers continue to be strong and total urgent care placements increased to 639 with the addition of 33 new accounts. The entire U.S. medical team did an outstanding job in both Q1 and Q2. In Q3 we will continue to focus on maintaining rotor usage level amongst our more mature physician customers while expanding our physician customer base, and in parallel we will accelerate our expansion into attractive markets beyond the physician office space. Back to you, Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, okay. Thank you very much, Brenton. And now we are open for questions."
136,GV_024888_2014Q2,"Presentation Operator Good day, and welcome to the Abaxis Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2014 Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Joe Dorame of Lytham Partners. Please go ahead, sir. Joe L. Dorame Thank you, Denise. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today to review the financial results of Abaxis for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014 ended September 30, 2013.

With that having been said, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody. I’ll review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q2 FY 2014 and then some of the goals for Q3. And then after my short presentation, I’ll ask Don Wood, our Chief Operations Officer and the Interim Director of North American Animal Health, as well as Rick Betts, our Director of Sales and Marketing for the North American Medical market, to give an update on their respective businesses, and then we'll take questions. The continuing major challenge in Q2 is working through our transition for mostly direct sales to working with partners. The processes are different and this change in market coverage means the focus of our sales and marketing people is to work more with our partners instead of mostly working with just customers. This process change in Abaxis has been too slow, and with the change in management, we are stepping up the pace. While MWI is doing a very good job with sales up quarter-over-quarter for 4 quarters, our small distributors are still experiencing lower sales year-over-year. We are working with our smaller partners to help them set and achieve growth goals in this new environment and expect to see improvements over the next couple of quarters. Another issue we are dealing with is the imbalance of inventory in our distribution network since the addition of MWI. We have some distributors that have too much disc inventory and not enough cartridges, some with too many hematology instruments and not enough i-STAT instruments, some with too many Prep Profiles and not enough T4 disc, and this imbalance also has a short term negative effect on our gross margins because of lower sales of high-margin discs and higher sales of lower margin other vet consumables and instruments. This is the second quarter we have been working through this. We believe we may have a quarter or 2 more to go in making sure our distributers have the right balance of products. Now Abbott has picked up the pace and the results have improved over Q1 with domestic medical sales finishing Q2 2014 at $5.1 million, up 36% quarter-over-quarter but still down about 3% versus Q2 last year. We did sell 5 Piccolos to a new CRO customer in Q2, with 4 units to the U.S. and 1 to the U.K., and more to follow from Rick in a few minutes. Last quarter, we decided that was in our interest to modify our contract with Abbott and eliminate China from the agreement. Changes in reimbursement and our interest in having Abbott focus on U.S. market were the reasons for this modification. We are working on launching the Piccolo with partners we are currently interviewing and believe not having a second layer of distribution will provide more flexibility and higher gross margin in this market. Our AVRL posted lower sales growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year but had a significant reduction in net loss, down 3 times the sales increase quarter-over-quarter, finishing at a loss of under $1 million or $930,000. Our AVRL sales were up 4% quarter-over-quarter and 114% year-over-year and finished Q2 at $2.3 million, and distractions with the changes in distribution along with the focus on tying AVRL services with instrument sales and spending less time on just selling AVRL services to non- instrument customers, meant less total selling time spend on AVRL in Q2. We are committed to making AVRL a key part of our strategy, but in order for this to work, we need to tie both instruments and AVRL services together. This is a change from our previous quarters where setting up an AVRL customer without an in-house instrument purchase was encouraged. This is a deviation from our proposal of splitting the sample, doing your routine test in-house and sending out the specialty test to AVRL. Without the point-of-care capabilities in our new account, our solution is not compelling enough to satisfy some vet practices. So it is mostly a waste of time and expense to deviate from our complete solution. Now even with these challenges, total worldwide vet sales grew 8% when compared to Q2 last year to finish at $38 million and were up 4% versus last quarter. Domestic vet sales finished Q2 at $31.1 million, up 7% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter. Total sales for Q2 FY'14 finished at $45.9 million, up 4% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter. Worldwide medical sales for Q2 finished at $7.2 million, up 19% quarter-over-quarter, mostly due to higher sales to Abbott. Year-over-year, medical sales were down 10%, but if you exclude our first large CRO deal closed last year, worldwide medical sales would be down only 2%. Domestic sales totaled $37.3 million, up 4% year-over-year and 8% quarter-over-quarter. International sales in Q2 finished at $8.5 million, up 2% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. However, international sales in Q2 last year included about $720,000 from our first large CRO account. So if that is excluded, international sales would have been up 11% year-over-year. European sales finished Q2 at $6.4 million, down 1% percent year-over-year, but x the CRO deal they would have been up 10% versus Q2 last year. Pac Rim sales for Q2 totaled $2.1 million, up 13% versus Q2 last year. Vet disc sales at 1 million units were down year-over-year by about 7% due to the imbalance of inventory in our distribution channel. This imbalance of vet disc inventory started with the addition of MWI and mostly affects our small partners. Their forecasts were wrong and they ordered too many discs in Q3 and Q4 last year, and now we are making the adjustments. Based on our internal calculations, actual shipments of discs to end users in Q2 FY'14 were approximately 1.2 million units, which were up about 8% versus Q2 of last year. In dollars, vet disc sales totaled $16.1 million, down about 5% versus Q2 of last year. Medical disc sales finished the quarter at 635,000 units, up 10% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over- quarter. A pickup from Abbott was the main reason for the increase. In dollars, medical disc sales totaled $4.8 million, down 3% year-over-year, due to the lower average selling price to Abbott, but up quarter- over-quarter by 7% due to the higher volume. Total disc sales of 1.6 million units were down about 1% year-over-year and down about 6% quarter-over-quarter due to the issues discussed earlier. Other vet consumable revenues that include, i-STAT, coag cartridges, rapid tests and hematology reagent packs, finished Q2 2014 at $7.7 million, up 4% versus Q2 last year but down about 1% versus last quarter. Instrument sales for Q2 finished very strong at 1,768 units, up 13% year-over-year and up 44% quarter- over-quarter. In dollars, instrument sales finished at $13.5 million, up 17% year-over-year and 56% quarter-over-quarter. The strong performance was due to higher sales to both Abbott and MWI. In Q2, we sold 577 VetScans versus 572 in Q2 last year and 475 last quarter. We sold 480 hematology instruments versus 372 Q2 last year and 271 last quarter, and 242 Piccolos versus 259 Q2 last year and 126 last quarter. And finally, we sold 469 i-STAT and coag instruments versus 364 Q2 last year and 357 last quarter. Now one word of caution when comparing instrument sales Q2 this year versus Q2 last year. We sold about 373 more units that went into the distributor inventory Q2 this year than Q2 last year. This change was due to a commitment made by one of our vet distributor partners for a year-end promotion that started this month and will run through December. Now, 30% of our sales for the quarter were capital sales while 70% were consumables and other. This compares with 26%-74% Q2 last year and 20%-80% last quarter. 19% of total sales were international while 81% were North American. This compares with 19%-81% Q2 last year and 20%-80% last quarter. 16% of total sales were medical sales, 83% were vet sales and 1% other. This compares with 18%-79%-3% Q2 of last year and 14%-84%-2% last quarter. Disc average selling price finished Q2 this year at $12.80, down $0.41 versus Q2 last year and down $0.28 versus last quarter into lower vet disc sales. Disc cost for the quarter came in at $3.91, up $0.04 versus Q2 last year and up $0.01 versus last quarter, also due to lower volume. Disc margin finished the quarter at 69% versus 71% Q2 last year. Our sales mix with higher instrument sales along with growth in the lower margin other vet consumable sales and fewer vet disc sales led to lower gross margins for Q2 this year, which finished at 47.7%, down from 52.2% Q2 last year and 48.4% last quarter. Once we fix the inventory imbalance and see shipments of vet discs back to normal, we expect gross margins to get back to the low to mid 50% level. Operating expenses at $16.2 million were 35.3% of sales, were down from the adjusted non-GAAP operating expenses of 38.3% of sales which were adjusted due to the legal settlement in Q2 of last year and down from last quarter's 37.7% sales. Excluding the adjustment due to the legal settlement in Q2 of last year, operating expenses finished at 45% of sales. Sales and marketing expenses for Q2 2014 totaled $9.9 million or 21.6% of sales, and they were down from 26% of sales in Q2 of last year and down from 23.2% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses at $3.4 million or 7.5% of sales were down from 8.1% of sales Q2 last year but up from 7.4% of sales last quarter. Admin expenses at $2.9 million were 6.2% of sales, were up from 6% of the non-GAAP admin expenses in Q2 last year but down from the 10.4% GAAP admin expenses Q2 of last year. Last quarter, admin expenses were 7.1% of sales. Operating income totaled $5.7 million, up 67% excluding the gain from the legal settlement in Q2 of last year. After the adjustments for the legal fees and bonuses, non-GAAP operating income for Q2 last year was $6.3 million. Quarter-over-quarter, operating income was up 23%. Pre-tax income finished at $6.2 million, down from the pre-tax income in Q2 last year that included the $17.25 million legal settlement and totaled $20.9 million. Excluding adjustments and legal fees and legal settlement, the pre-tax income for Q2 last year finished at $6.5 million. Quarter-over-quarter, pre-tax was up 23%. Net income for Q2 FY '14 totaled $4 million, down from the GAAP net income in Q2 FY '13 that totaled $12.9 million and down slightly from the $4.1 million non-GAAP net income from Q2 last year. Earnings per share for Q2 FY '14 finished at $0.18 a share, the same as the adjusted non-GAAP earnings for Q2 last year. Quarter-over-quarter, net income was up 24%. On the R&D side of the business, we have completed the development, clinical trials and submitted our Ehrlichia test to the USDA and look forward to clearance at any time. The development of the other 3 rapid tests is on schedule to be completed by the end of the calendar year. We signed a deal with LamdaGen [ph], a small company that has the technology that will allow us to do high sensitivity immunoassays on the disc. The feasibility has started, and if successful, we'll start on product development in about 6 to 8 months. Now going through Q3 include working with our vet distributors to help them manage their inventories so we can eliminate the imbalances that have existed over the last couple of quarters. In additions, we are working with all our partners to up their overall performance which includes working with our field sales team to optimize the selling process so it becomes more consistent with our new sales model of working through distribution partners. We have reorganized field structure and are changing the comp plan so incentive pay is more aligned with our goals. More from Don in a few minutes. Keeping the focus on our AVRL business is also a priority, not only growing sales but continue to make improvements in our cost structure. Our team in Kansas did a nice job last quarter reducing the loss to below $1 million and now we need to make sure all new VetScan customers get a chance to experience the benefits of using AVRL along with the new Abaxis instrumentation. Q3 is usually a strong instrument quarter so we should have more opportunities to promote AVRL this quarter. On the medical side of our business, we continue to work on the 4 clinical research opportunities for the Piccolo, and as I indicated before, we did sell 5 Piccolos last quarter to a new CRO account. On the retail side of our medical business, we are training the folks at the validation sites for our first new customer this week and are working on helping them set up a couple more sites this quarter. More from Rick in a few minutes. With that, Don, you're on. Donald P. Wood President & COO Good afternoon. The U.S. vet business continues to transition this quarter from primarily a direct sales model including working with local and regional distributors with less than 10% market share to a model with less selling direct and transitioning to a traditional distributor-partner model once we've added MWI, a national distributor, who currently has a 30% market share in the U.S. Our transition has covered 3 quarters now and Q2 fiscal year 2014 revenues of $30.8 million was up 7% or $2.1 million year-over-year and we were up 4% or $1.3 million quarter-over-quarter. As you can see, results are improving as we continue to balance the distributor inventory mix and imbalances issues that Clint spoke about. We've begun meeting with our distributor partners to improve our performance back to double-digit growth model that we historically have been. Our new management team is busy delivering a new target list and opportunities to all our distributors along with new programs to offer a complete solution sale to the veterinarian. This has been viewed as good news by our distributors and there is much excitement going forward. In additions to the 7% year-on-year growth in revenue, our highlights from our second fiscal quarter '14 include, disc revenues up 39% year-on-year at $9.8 million; total instruments sold in Q2 was 1,201 up 22% year-over-year; and chemistry instruments up 12% on the year, hematology 17%, and i-STAT instruments up 119%. Our national accounts revenue was trending nicely and is up 89% year-on-year and 32% up quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating the hard work is paying off into this segment of the market. We expect further good news as we explore additional opportunities. AVRL with net revenues of $2.3 million was up 4% or $97,000 from the prior quarter and 114% versus year ago. Additionally last quarter, 212 facilities combined instrument purchases with 1 of our AVRL programs accounting for 332 instruments sold and $2.4 million in our instrument revenue, and I'm very excited about the expense controls leading to a large reduction in our net loss. AVRL is the leading focus for our new management team going forward and we are expecting improved results over the next few quarters. AVRL has also successfully completed a bidirectional interface with AVImark, the largest practice management system provider to the veterinary industry, covering an estimated 30% of all vet clinics nationally. This allows AVRL to integrate into their laboratory management system to streamline ordering of tests, results reporting and automatically delivering the results to the vet and invoice to patients for those services. This additions will improve our opportunity to add new customers to AVRL. Finally, I wanted to update you on organizational changes in the North American Animal Health business unit. With the retirement of our Chief Commercial Officer, Mr. Marty Mulroy, we have promoted Dr. Craig Tockman to lead our vet sales group and he will be responsible for all outside sales activities. Craig has been a veterinarian since 1989 and grew his practice into 5 locations. He has been with Abaxis for over 12 years where he developed utilization programs for our customers, created training programs for our sales teams, participated in multiple product launches including AVRL where he represented the voice of our customer. He also managed a field sales team leading them to a number 1 position in the country. He's been riding with our sales team for years helping them in their performance and adding to their success. David Bannister has been with Abaxis for over 6 years as the Director of Customer Care and has developed an incredible customer focus team here at Abaxis. David has over 36 years of experience including the past 28 years specifically in medical diagnostic segments for laboratory diagnostics. David will be in charge of all inside activities in Union City. Both Craig and David will report directly to me and they both demonstrate the strong bench that we have built here in Abaxis and with them our future is very strong. Our distributors and our sales force are very excited about the changes and we look forward to nothing but great results from Craig and David. Thank you. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Don. Okay now, Rick, you're on. Rick Betts Former Director of Medical Sales & Marketing - Medical Diagnostics Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon all. For the quarter, the domestic medical division finished with revenues of $5.07 million, up 36% from $3.71 million in the previous quarter but down 3% from last year. The quarter yielded 190 [ph] Piccolos that were put into use and 540,000 reagent discs consumed. The Piccolo total includes 155 placed by Abbott with the remainder being spread across our Canadian clinical trials, the cruise line and retail health businesses. More on those respective areas in a moment. Abbott's progress grew nicely overall this quarter. Their sales included a large placement of over 30 instruments to a single urgent care customer further illustrating that the Piccolo continues to be the standard of care in the expanding urgent care segment. Now 9 months into selling the Piccolo, Abbott sales organization is becoming seasoned with the product and the positioning in the POL market. The Abbott sales engine has a ton of horsepower, and through an increased marketing effort as fuel, we expect the acceleration to continue. Our heightened focus in Canada is paying dividends and the market acceptance of the Piccolo product continues to rise. In half a year, we already have more new customers up North and double the revenue from the entire previous year. With a provincial RFP concluding and our Class 3 submission to Health Canada completed, we expect this upcoming quarter to be a very exciting one for the Piccolo in Canada. In the clinical trials market, we closed and engaged a substantial pilot with one of the world's largest clinical trials laboratories in partnership with a very large and respected pharmaceutical company. As Clint mentioned, this pilot contains 5 sites, 4 in the U.S. and 1 in the U.K. The Piccolos were purchased for this pilot and it is short in duration, months versus years. When complete, it will prove with actionable metrics the Piccolo's value to the patient recruitment aspect of clinical trials initiation. This pilot served as the second major proof point for the Piccolo's utility in clinical trials and with our growing pipeline of interested organizations, we are excited about what the future holds for this segment. On the retail health front, we executed a confidentiality agreement with the new customer we mentioned last quarter. While we won't be able to mention the names or specifics moving forward, I can say that the initiative is underway and progressing nicely. As Clint mentioned, the sites are installed, the operator trainings are in progress, and the initiative is expanding to other areas of the country as the pharmacy chain prepares itself to take the lead in the post-Obamacare world. Thank you and I'll now turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you very much, Rick, and now we're open for questions."

With that having been said, I’d like to turn the call over to Mr. Clint Severson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis. Clint? Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, thank you Joe, and good afternoon everybody. I’ll review the accomplishments and the challenges for Q3 2013 and then some of the goals for Q4. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, our Chief Commercial Officer of North American Vet Sales and Marketing and Rick Betts, our Director of North American Medical Marketing to give an update on their respective businesses, and then we will take questions. Our operating challenges for Q3 were fewer than last year but included lower government sales, which finished Q3 2013 at just under $400,000, down about 49% year-over-year and down 35% quarter-over- quarter. Going forward, Abbott will be responsible for the majority of our government revenues as they pickup our medical business in the U.S. We will still focus on the Vet portion which was about 19% of the total government sales so far this fiscal year. Another challenge for Q3 was lower rapid task sales compared to last year and last quarter which lowered gross margins due to the minimum royalty payment we made to Lehr [ph]. Our focus on instruments, disks, the training of our new distribution and the seasonality of this business are the main reasons for the shortfall. While we continue to lose money to AVRL, the total loss was reduced this quarter by about $218,000 but was still a drag on gross margins. With AVRL sales up by more than 28% quarter-over-quarter, and losses down about 13% I think we’re on the right track but we’ll hear more from Marty in a few minutes. Even though we had challenges, we set many records in Q3 FY13. First we had record sales at just under $50 million finishing the quarter with total sales at $49.8 million, up 32% year-over-year and up 13% quarter-over-quarter. Worldwide Vet sales for Q3 also set a record and totaled $39.9 million, up 40% versus Q3 last year. And North America Vet sales were also up 40% versus Q3 last year finishing the quarter at $33.6 million also a new record and more from Marty in a few minutes. North American total revenue finished at a record at $41.8 million, up 31% year-over-year and up 16% quarter-over-quarter with double-digit growth from both medical and Vet growth. International sales finished Q3 2013 very strong at $8 million, up 33% over Q3 last year. European sales totaled $6.2 million, up 37% year-over-year and the PAC-RIM sales finished at $1.8 million, up 22% over Q3 last year. Worldwide medical sales finished at a record level even though the medical sales to the government were done almost 49% to finish at $9 million, up 10% year-over-year and 14% quarter-over-quarter. Domestic medical sales were also at record levels finishing at $6.7 million, up 18% year-over-year and 29% quarter-over-quarter and included our first order from Abbott and a strong instrument quarter from our sales team, more from Rick in a few minutes. We broke all past records with our instruments sales in Q3 FY13, with total unit sales of 1,818 instruments, up 623 instruments and 52% year-over-year and up 251 instruments or 16% quarter-over- quarter. In dollars, instrument sales finished up 54% year-over-year and 20% quarter-over-quarter. We sold 545 Vet scans versus 438 Q3 last year and 572 last quarter. 395 hematology instruments versus 245 Q3 last year and 372 last quarter. 306 Piccolos versus 226 Q3 last year and 259 last quarter. And finally, we sold 572 i-STAT and COAG instruments versus 286 last year and 364 last quarter. Total disc sales at 2.1 million units finished the quarter at a record and were up 29% versus Q3 last year and up 25% versus last quarter. In dollars, total disc sales were up 31% versus Q3 last year. Piccolo disc sales finished at a record 764,000 units, up 17% year-over-year and 32% quarter-over-quarter. Total Vet disc sales at 1.3 million units also a new record were up 37% year-over-year and 22% quarter-over-quarter. Other Vet consumable revenues that include i-STAT and COAG cartridges, rapid tests and hematology packs finished Q3 FY13 at $6 million and we’re down 6% versus Q3 last year, mostly due to lower rapid test sales. 18% of our sales this quarter were medical sales while 80% were Vet and 2% other. This compares to with 22/75/3 Q3 last year and 18/79/3 last quarter. 28% of total sales were capital sales while 72% were consumable. This compares with 24/76 last year and 26/74 last quarter. 16% of sales were international while 84% were domestic. This compares with 16/84 Q3 last year and 19/81 last quarter. Disc average selling price finished Q3 at $12.83, up $0.27 versus Q3 last year but down about $0.37 versus last quarter. The reason for the decline quarter-over-quarter is the mix. Disc cost at $3.77 was up $0.05 year-over-year but down $0.10 quarter-over-quarter. Disc margin finished the quarter at 71%. Now the gross margin was adversely affected by the continued negative gross margin of AVRL and our mix of higher instrument sales as a percent of total sales and finished at 52.4%, down 170 basis points year- over-year. Quarter-over-quarter, however, margins were up 20 basis points. Now if you exclude AVRL, the investment we’re making there, gross margins would have finished Q3 at 55.6%. As we near our breakeven at AVRL and continue to reduce disc costs, we should see margins continue to expand throughout the rest of this calendar year. Operating expenses for Q3 FY13 finished at $18.4 million or 36.9% of sales, which is down from 41.9% of sales Q3 last year and down from 38.3% of sales last quarter, which was adjusted for the Cepheid legal settlement. Operating expenses for AVRL decreased $230,000 or about 28% versus last quarter. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $12.4 million or 24.8% of sales, which is down from 26.2% of sales Q3 last year and included the severance costs for the 7 medical sales folks who are leaving due to the Abbott deal and the extra training costs associated with the addition of MWI and Abbott as new distribution partners and it was up slightly from the 24.7% of sales last quarter. R&D expenses of $3.8 million or 7.6% of sales were up from 7% of sales Q3 last year and down from 8.1% of sales last quarter. Admin expenses totaled $2.2 million or 4.4% of sales and we’re down from 8.7% of sales Q3 last year and down from 6% of sales last quarter, after the adjustments related to the Cepheid settlement. We also have record operating earnings for Q3 2013, which totaled $7.7 million up 66% year-over-year and up 23% quarter-over-quarter after adjusting for the Cepheid settlement in Q2. Net income of $5 million also a record, excluding the adjustments for the Cepheid in Q2 and it was up 75% versus Q3 last year and up 21% versus last quarter, again after the adjustments for the Cepheid lawsuit settlement. And we finished at $0.22 a share, up from the adjusted $0.18 a share last quarter or up 22%. Now on the R&D side of the business, the focus is on completing the menu of Abaxis rapid test. One should be submitted this quarter and the rest on various stages of development. These new products are key to growing this product line with a goal set to have all these test developed by the end of September this year. Q4 goals include, keeping the sales momentum going in the vet market especially with our MWI partnership. We’ve invested and now we believe our future return will be significant. AVRL sales growth and the reduction of the operating loss is also a key success factor for Q4. On the medical side of our business, we are focusing with Abbott to make sure the loose ends on the transfer of our U.S. business that started in January, get tied up and they get the support they need to meet their aggressive targets. We have 2 senior sales managers working on the clinical research opportunity with 2 potential projects in the works. In addition, we now have a full-time senior sales manager responsible for Canada, which is an area with good potential that has not been covered in the past. Europe is another area where we continue to get good growth in both Vet and medical markets and that’ll also be a priority in Q4. Disc costs of the 2x2 project continue to show results, so keeping this project on track will be important for meeting Q4 financial goals. With that, Marty, you’re on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Thank you, Clint. In my prepared remarks I will provide some additional details surrounding the North American Animal Health business. In our third quarter fiscal year 2013, North American Animal Health recorded record revenues of $33.6 million, up 18% from our prior quarter or $5.1 million and year-over- year up 40%, an increase of $9.6 million. As Clint mentioned, AVRL contributed just under $1.4 million to revenue, up 28% from our prior quarter. Our reference laboratory segment is rapidly approaching now a $6 million business. 237 customers last quarter purchased or leased Abaxis instruments combined with one or more AVRL programs, accounting for 444 instruments and $3.8 million in revenue. In dollars, records were set for i-STAT instruments, VSpro instruments, VSpro cartridges and rotor sales with the rotor revenue in Q3 for the U.S. and Canada at $17 million. In units, records were set in VSpro instruments, i-STAT instruments, VSpro cartridges and again rotors at over 1 million units purchased in the U.S. and Canada in our Q3. ASP in-roads continue to be made with the i-STAT cartridges and our line of rapid diagnostic tests. Our instrument business continued to be very strong. We shipped a record 1,264 instruments, up 29% versus last quarter’s record instrument sales of 983. Additionally, the ASP on hematology year-over-year improved 15% and the VetScan VS2 chemistry ASP improved 9% year-over-year. Much of the success we attribute to the impacts of our AVRL combined with continued investment in the U.S. and Canada field sales and field sales support. The MWI initial stocking order also had an impact. The MWI partnership is off and running sales through and with MWI commencing January 2nd and early signs are very promising. We are excited about the mutual opportunity to continue to grow our respected businesses and additionally I would like to congratulate and thank the North American Animal Health team for yet another quarter of strong revenue growth. And we look forward to the continued momentum and future contributions from the entire organization. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to the boss. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Thank you very much Marty. Okay, for all of you that might not have met Rick Betts before, Rick has been with us for about 5 years as Director of Marketing for the Medical team. And Rick will be the person responsible for managing the Abbott relationship and so I think he’s been on conference calls before but it’s been a while. So I would like to introduce Rick Betts, you’re on now. Rick Betts Former Director of Medical Sales & Marketing - Medical Diagnostics Thank you, Clint and good afternoon all. I’m proud to report that the U.S. Medical team set a host of new records in Q3. As Clint mentioned, record domestic medical revenues of $6.7 million were up 29% quarter-over-quarter and up 18% year-over-year. Piccolo placements of 172 instruments topped the previous best and our sales team averaged 15.6 placements per headcount which was almost 50% higher than the old mark. In addition to the placements, we also sold 103 instruments to distributors which included the initial Abbott stocking order, more on Abbott later. U.S. Medical disc sales were up 21% at a record 646,000 units versus 536,000 units a year ago and they were also up 41% quarter-over-quarter. Q3 disc sales also include the initial Abbott inventory stock. The breakdown of Piccolo placements for Q3 is as follows, 56 to general practitioners, 49 to urgent care, 26 to internal medicine, 15 to large clinics and hospitals and 26 to various other specialties. Catapult Health also employed another 10 instruments in their occupational health offering. There are several reasons for the sales growth we experienced. First, the election ended and while the jury may still be out on the impact of health care, it did eliminate a lot of uncertainty that was causing physicians to delay purchases for their practices. Secondly, since the physicians didn’t buy many things in 2012, the year-end section 179 tax benefits were more prevalent than in previous years creating more purchasing opportunities. And lastly, being the competitors they are, our sales team wanted to set the bar very high for the incoming Abbott team and they did exactly that. With regards to the Abbott transition, I’m also proud to report that in just 12 weeks since the announcement, Abbott is now mission ready to support the piccolo customer base and existing channel partners. A mountain of work was completed in a very short time and both the Abaxis and Abbott transition teams are collaborating closely to ensure that there is minimal impact to the customers. With any transition of this magnitude, there is still a great deal of work to do in order to ensure success. But if the past is any indication of the future, Abbott is well on its way to exceeding expectations. As for me and the rest of my remaining teammates we will be focusing on ensuring Abbott’s success through training and ongoing consultative collaboration, in addition, we will also be working on building new medical business and revenues through some exciting carve outs including the clinical trials, retail, Canada, Catapult Health and the merchant marine. Thank you. And now I’ll turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you very much, Rick. And now we’re open for questions."

Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everybody, and welcome. I’ll spend a little bit of time here reviewing the accomplishments and challenges for Q4 FY13 and for the fiscal year ending in March, and then I'll cover some of the goals for FY2014. After my short presentation, I’ll ask Marty Mulroy, our Chief Commercial Officer of North American Animal Health and Rick Betts, our Director of Marketing for the Medical Market in the U.S. here, to give an update on their respective businesses, and then we'll take questions. Now while we had record performance in Q4, we did have some challenges in our Medical business due to the transition from a direct sales model to a distribution model with Abbott. The assignment of distribution contracts in the last formal training session that was completed in late January resulted in field activity starting in February. There's always a startup period that can delay some sales in making big changes like we have, and we believe this transition will be fully complete over the next couple of quarters. More from Rick in a few minutes. In Europe, medical sales were also less than expected due to the difficulties in both the Italian and Spanish markets. The Osteri [ph] programs implemented over the last few quarters affected Piccolo instrument sales in both these countries. Total worldwide medical sales finished the quarter at $6.3 million, down about 18% versus Q4 last year. And for the year, medical sales finished at $31.6 million, up 4% versus FY2012. Domestic medical sales, excluding the government sales, finished the year at $21.2 million which was flat compared to last year. More to follow from Rick in a few minutes. Now even though we had big changes in our medical distribution that resulted in some lower sales in the Medical market for the quarter, we experienced record overall performance in Q4 2013. Total sales finished at a record $50 million, up 17% year-over-year, and for the full year sales totaled $186 million, up 19%. Worldwide veterinary sales at $42.9 million were up 25% in Q4 compared to Q4 of last year, and up 8% compared to last quarter. For the year, worldwide vet sales totaled $150.5 million up 23%, both new records. North American vet sales also set a new record finishing Q4 at $36.3 million up 26% versus Q4 last year. And for FY2013, North American net sales totaled to $125.8 million, up 25%. More from Marty in a few minutes. We also have record domestic sales of $41.9 million for Q4, up 18% versus Q4 last year. And for FY 2013, domestic sales totaled $152.8 million, up 18%, also a new record. International sales for Q4 finished at $8.1 million, up 10% versus Q4 last year even with the difficulties in Spain and Italy. For the year, international sales totaled $33.3 million, up 20%. Europe finished Q4 with sales of $6.2 million, up 10% versus Q4 last year. And for the year, European sales finished in a record $26.1 million, up 19%. Pac Rim sales totaled $1.9 million in Q4 ’13, up 11% compared to Q4 last year. And for the year, total Pac Rim sales finished at $7.2 million, up 26%, a new record. Record vet disc sales at 1.5 million units for Q4 were up 18% year-over-year. For FY 2013, net disc sales finished at 5.1 million units, up 15%. Total disc sales for Q4 totaled 2 million units, up 11% year-over- year. For the year, total disc sales finished at 7.5 million units, up 11%. In dollars, total disc sales for Q4 totaled $27 million, up 17% year-over-year. For the year, total disc sales finished at $99.3 million, up 13%. Other debt consumable revenues that include i-STAT and coag cartridges, rapid tests and hematology reagent packs finished Q4 '13 at a record $8.8 million, up 25% compared to Q4 last year. And for the year, other vet consumables totaled $28.2 million, up about 8%, also a new record. AVRL sales in Q4 grew 31% quarter-over-quarter to a new record of $1.8 million, while operating losses declined to $1.2 million, a $232,000 improvement over Q3. We had instrument sales in Q4 of 1,485 instruments, up 13% year-over-year. And for the year we sold a total of 6,173 instruments, up 30% over last year. We sold 473 VetScans versus 545 last quarter and 456 Q4 last quarter. For the year, we sold 2,036 VetScans up 15%. We sold 341 hematology instruments versus 285 Q4 last year and 395 last quarter. For the year, we sold 1,341 hematology analyzers, up 29% versus last year. We sold 183 Piccolos versus 264 Q4 last year and 306 last quarter. For the year we sold, 1,072 Piccolos, up 29% compared to last year. And finally, we sold 488 i-STAT and coag instruments versus 307 Q4 last year and 572 last quarter. For the year, we sold 1,724 i-STAT and coag instruments, up 55% compared to FY 2012. Now 21% of the sales for the quarter were capital sales while 79% were consumable and this compares with 23%/77% Q4 last year and 28%/72% last quarter. For the year the mix was 25%/75%. 16% of total sales were international sales while 84% were North American. This compares to 17%/83% Q4 last year and 16%/84% last quarter. For the year the mix was 18%/82%. 13% of sales were medical sales while 86 were Vet sales and 1% other. This compares with 18%/82% Q4 last year and 18%/82% last quarter. For the year, Medical sales were 17% of total sales and Vet sales were 81% and 2% other. Now the disc average selling price at $13.53 was up $0.28 versus Q4 last year and up $0.70 versus last quarter. Disc cost at $3.76 were down $0.17 versus Q4 last year and $0.01 versus last quarter. Disc gross margin finished at 72%, up from 70% Q4 last year. And for the year disc costs were down $0.07. Now gross profit for Q4 FY '13 was up 12% year-over-year, but gross margins were down about 230 basis points, mostly due to the lower ASPs on medical products sold to Abbott and higher sales of other debt consumable products that have a lower gross margin than products we manufacture. For the year gross profit was up 15% and gross margins were down about 150 basis points, mostly due to AVRL losses in the Abbott distribution deal. Operating expenses for Q4 finished at a very efficient 34.4% of sales, down from 39.7% of sales Q4 last year and 36.9% of sales last quarter. For the year operating expense as a percent of sales, excluding the adjustment for the Cepheid legal settlement gain and related expenses, finished at 37.9% of sales compared to 41.9% of sales last year. Now sales and marketing expenses for Q4 FY '13 finished at $11.3 million or 22.6% of sales, down from 20 -- I'm sorry, 22.6% of sales, down from 26.2% of sales Q4 last year, and down from 24.8% of sales last quarter. For the year sales and marketing expenses finished at 25.2% of sales, down from 25.3% of sales last year. R&D expenses for Q4 at $3.2 million or 6.5% of sales were down from 7.4% of sales Q4 last year and 7.6% of sales last quarter. For the year R&D expenses finished at 7.3% of sales, down from 7.8% of sales last year. Now admin expenses for Q4 at $2.7 million or 5.4% of sales were down from 6.1% of sales Q4 last year and up from 4.4% of sales last quarter. For the year admin expenses finished at 6.9% of sales versus 8.8% of sales last year. The operating income finished at a record in Q4 at $9 million, up 40% year-over-year and 17% quarter-over-quarter. For the year operating income excluding the adjustments for the Cepheid settlement totaled $27.7 million, up 43%. Operating income per share excluding the Cepheid adjustment for the year totaled $1.24 beating our goal of $1 a share operating income by $0.24. Now our new company goal is going to be at 10% market share of the Clinical Chemistry market, which is about a $5 billion market. Now net income at $6.7 million for Q4 is also a new record and was up 42% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter or $0.30 a share. Net income for 2013 -- for fiscal year 2013, net income totaled $27.5 million or $1.23 a share up from $0.58 a share last year. Now excluding the Cepheid adjustment for settlement gain and related expenses, a net income for the year finished at $18.7 million or $0.83 a share, up 43%. Now the R&D side of the business, we received FDA clearance on our lactate test along with the finger- stick clearance for cholesterol and HDL. Ehrlichia is close to being submitted to the USDA and we continue to make progress in scaling up the manufacturing process for the hemoglobin test. Goals for Q1 and FY 2014 include clearly a focus on the Abbott relationship and keeping the excellent sales momentum going with MWI. We’ll keep as a priority the building of our vet reference lab business. The trends look very good. And if we can keep this momentum going we have an excellent chance of hitting our aggressive goals of this fiscal year we're in right now. R&D goals for the year include finishing the menu of rapid tests, completing the scale up and submission on the hemoglobin, supporting the 2x2 program in the factory and identifying a high sensitivity immunoassay platform that is compatible with the Piccolo. This new platform could allow us to expand our test markets -- our test menu into markets that are even larger than the Clinical Chemistry market. Now in addition to closely working with Abbott to scale up our medical business we'll also be working on the CRO retail and Canadian opportunities. We have 2 folks working full time on the CRO opportunity, 1 on Canada, and the 2 folks working with Abbott are on the retail. In the factory, the 2x2 program continues to be a priority with the goal of getting closer to $2 disc in cost. In addition to all of this stuff, we also have very aggressive sales and marketing goals for 2014. So with that, Marty, you're on. Martin V. Mulroy Former Chief Commercial Officer for North America Animal Health Great. Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon. In my prepared remarks I'll provide some additional detail surrounding the North American Animal Health business. In our fourth quarter fiscal year 2013, North American Animal Health recorded record revenues of $36 million, up 7% from our prior quarter or $2.3 million and year-over-year up 27%, an increase of $7.6 million. For the fiscal year North American Animal Health recorded revenues of $124.5 million in revenue, up 26% versus FY '12, an increase of $25.4 million. As Clint mentioned AVRL contributed $1.8 million to the Q4 revenue, up 31% from the prior quarter. Our reference laboratory segment annual run rate now is exceeding a $7 million business. In our Q4 167 customers purchased or leased instruments combined with one or more AVRL program accounting for a total of 274 instruments and $2.3 million in revenue. In dollars, along with AVRL records were set in Q4 for hematology reagents, our rapid test product line and rotor sales with rotor revenue in Q4 at a record $18.5 million. We are also very pleased with our total instrument revenue, instrument revenue up 40% year-over-year. Much of this success we attribute to the impact of our AVRL sales and marketing programs, combined with our investments in infrastructure, [indiscernible] sales expansion, continuous product improvement and new product development. And with that I'll turn it back to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great. Thank you, Marty. Okay, Rick, you're next. Rick Betts Former Director of Medical Sales & Marketing - Medical Diagnostics Thank you, Clint. Good afternoon, all. For the quarter the domestic medicals division brought in $4.145 million, which resulted in a fiscal year total of $20.695 million versus $20.997 million the previous fiscal year. The quarterly total included 130 Piccolo instruments and 346,000 reagent discs sold to Abbot for distribution in the U.S. POL market. Q4 was filled with a mountain of activities associated with helping Abbott get up to speed as quickly as possible, Abbott's sales team are quick learners and since they began selling in early February, each passing week has seen a growth in Piccolo placements. While a considerable amount of work remains on both Abbott and our parts to ensure success, we are encouraged by the professionalism, level of engagement and determination of this Abbott sales organization. In addition to Abbott's ongoing ramp-up, we began to make some significant traction in the carved out markets of Canada and clinical trials. In Canada we signed a new agreement with Inter Medico, one of the largest and most respected medical distribution companies serving the Canadian market, and we received 3 RFPs for Piccolo placements in provincial clinics, rural labs and small remote hospitals. We are also making some good in-roads with our clinical trials initiative, where the Piccolo can be useful as a standardized platform for stat patient dosing decisions. We have met with a variable who's who in the market and are very encouraged by the excitement and feedback we're receiving from some of the world’s largest and most respected pharma, CRO, and clinical lab companies. Thank you, I'll now turn it back over to Clint. Clinton H. Severson Chairman of the Board & CEO Great, okay. Thank you, Rick. Okay, with those comments we are open for question."

Richard A. Gonzalez Chairman & CEO Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for AbbVie's First Quarter 2013's Earnings Conference Call. Today, we're pleased to report strong results in our first quarter as an independent company, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. We delivered this strong performance despite the decline in TriCor sales due to generic competition. During the quarter, we executed on AbbVie's key priorities. We drove continued growth of HUMIRA with more than 17% global operational growth. We advanced our pipeline with continued progress across our mid- and late-stage R&D programs. This includes our Phase III HCV program, which is well underway and enrolling rapidly. And we delivered return to our shareholders through a strong dividend. As we've said before, 2013 is a year of transition as we absorb the impact from the loss of exclusivity of our lipids franchise. And 2013 is also a year of execution across both our commercial portfolio and our pipeline, and we're off to a strong start on all fronts. As I mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, particularly robust growth in dermatology and GI. Our global launch of UC is going well, with strong uptake in both the U.S. and Europe. Beyond UC, we continue our development efforts for HUMIRA, with several new indications currently in late-stage trials. We expect the cadence of data, registrations and regulatory approvals over the next few years. This includes our U.S. regulatory application for axial SpA, which is currently under review. And we also expect to submit our U.S. regulatory application for pediatrics Crohn's disease in the coming months. HUMIRA currently offers the broadest label in the category. Several of the new indications we are pursuing will be unique, unique to our label, and will help us further differentiate from competitive products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. All told, we expect new indications, including those approved in 2012, to add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global peak-year sales. As we track new product entrants, performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with HUMIRA continuing to gain or hold market share across all indications. Bill will talk more about HUMIRA and our other product performance in the quarter as well as our expectations for the year, but it's fair to say that HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year, well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for the product in 2013. Now moving to our pipeline. As a biopharmaceutical company, advancing our pipeline is paramount to our long-term success. We're focused on delivering innovative therapies to address the most pressing areas of unmet clinical need, and we're encouraged with our progress. Over the past year, we've advanced 2 promising programs into Phase III development, including our interferon-free HCV program, which I'll discuss in more detail here in a moment. We also expect to advance 7 additional programs into late-stage clinical trials over the next 12 to 18 months, for example, atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in development for diabetic kidney disease. We'll present results of our Phase IIb study at the European Renal Association meeting next month. And we're on track to initiate the Phase III program in the first half of this year. ABT-199, our next-generation BcL-2 inhibitor in development in partnership with Roche/Genentech, has shown strong activity in hematological malignancies. Earlier this month, we presented Phase I data showing patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with ABT-199 experience rapid tumor reduction. We'll present additional data at the upcoming ASCO and the EHA meetings in June. As discussed on our last quarterly conference call late last year, we paused dose escalation and recruitment in several ABT-199 studies as we work to refine the dosing and monitoring approach for patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome. We recently proposed an amended study protocol for ABT-199 in CLL. Upon approval by the FDA, dose escalation and new patient recruitment will resume. It remains our goal to initiate Phase II and Phase III studies in relapse or refractory CLL patients this year. We continue to have a high level of enthusiasm for this compound which we believe holds promise in a number of hematological malignancies. ABT-888 is another compound within our oncology pipeline poised to advance into Phase III in early 2014. ABT-888 is a PARP inhibitor and has shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of common cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation. It's currently in Phase IIb for BRCA-deficient breast cancer and other cancers. ABT-126 is our alpha7-NNR antagonist currently in Phase IIb trials for Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Data from our Phase IIa proof-of-concept study in Alzheimer's disease will be presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in July. And we'll present results from the schizophrenia study in 2014. Provided our Phase IIb clinical work is successful, we'll initiate Phase III trials in both indications in 2014. ABT-719, our novel investigational compound for the prevention of acute kidney injury. Additional confirmatory Phase IIb study is currently ongoing and will enable Phase III initiation in early 2014. Elagolix is a compound with a unique profile currently in development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids, both prevalent conditions with few treatment options. Our Phase III program for endometriosis is ongoing, and we recently initiated a Phase IIb study in uterine fibroids. Again, pending success in our mid- stage trial, the fibroid program is also poised to advance to Phase III next year. So as you can see, we have a number of exciting programs on track to advance to Phase III development over the next year or so. In addition to these assets, we have several other promising compounds already in late-stage development. This includes daclizumab, which is in Phase III development in partnership with Biogen, for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Data from the first of 2 registrational trials, the SELECT study, were recently published in The Lancet. And results of the second year extension of that study called SELECTION, were recently presented at the American Academy of Neurology meeting. We expect results from the second pivotal study in 2014. And finally, a central program within our late-stage pipeline is our interferon-free HCV combination. All the Phase III studies that will be included in our initial registration are now underway and enrolling very well, in fact, ahead of expectations. As we said before, the primary focus of our program is on delivering interferon-free treatments that offer patients the best chance for cure. Our approach is to maximize SVR rates across various patient types, from naive patients to the most difficult to treat, with the simplest possible therapy. Earlier this week, at the EASL meeting in Amsterdam, we presented data from our large Phase IIb Aviator study, showing that conditions which reduce response to interferon-based therapies, such as the level of fibrosis or IL28B genotype, do not impact response to our interferon-free therapy. We expect our Phase III study to begin to read out later this year and end at 2014. Supporting registration submission in mid-2014, given there our compounds have been granted fast track status by the FDA, we expect market entry in early 2015. So in summary, we've delivered a strong first quarter, and we continue to drive strong performance with our flagship product HUMIRA as well as other products in our specially focused portfolio. And we continue to make notable progress in advancing our pipeline, which we believe includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to address significant medical need. For a company of our size, the potential sales projections on our late-stage pipeline represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth beginning in the 2015 time frame. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill? William J. Chase Executive Vice President of Finance & Administration Thank you, Rick. Today, I'll spend some time talking about our first quarter performance. I'll then turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2013. As Rick said, we're very pleased with the strong first quarter we delivered. Total sales increased 5.1% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable 1.4% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding TriCor/Trilipix, due to loss of exclusivity, sales increased 8.6% on an operational basis. The first quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 76.2%, excluding intangible amortization and other specified items, in line with our expectation for the quarter. This reflects both the loss of exclusivity within our lipid franchise, as well as the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange on the ratio. Adjusted SG&A was 27.9% of sales in the first quarter, including continued investment in our growth brands and the incremental costs of becoming an independent company. This level of investment was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and we remain on track for a full year adjusted SG&A of around 26% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 14.6% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline and a continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. Net interest expense was $66 million in the first quarter, and other income was $18 million. The adjusted tax rate was 22.2% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $0.68, which exceeded our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.60 per share. Turning to product sales in the quarter. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $2.2 billion, up more than 17% on an operational basis. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 24%, driven by continued market expansion and share gains in the derm and gastro segments. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 13% on an operational basis and nearly 11% on a reported basis as a result of strong market growth and some modest benefit from tender timing. And as we look to the second quarter for international HUMIRA sales specifically, we'd expect a modest negative impact from tender timing in some markets, particularly Brazil. On a global basis, however, we expect low-double-digit sales growth for HUMIRA in the second quarter, in line with our full year outlook. AndroGel sales were up low single digits in the quarter, following strong 2012 performance. AndroGel continues to maintain more than 60% share of the testosterone-replacement market. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a moderation in the rate of overall market growth, as well as the year-over-year impact of rebating actions implemented in mid-2012. Based on current trends, we're forecasting AndroGel sales growth in the mid single digits for 2013. Global sales of Lupron were approximately $180 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2013, we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2012. Moving on to our lipid franchise. TriCor/Trilipix sales were $128 million in the quarter, down roughly 50% due to the entry of generic fenofibrate in November of 2012. U.S. sales of Niaspan were $186 million in the quarter, down 2.6%. As a reminder, we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion, which will be exhibited more acutely in the second half of the year. We plan to offset our lipid franchise decline through growth of key marketed products, including HUMIRA. Moving on to Synthroid where U.S. sales were $119 million in the quarter. Synthroid maintained strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. U.S. sales of Creon were $90 million in the first quarter, up more than 32% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Creon maintained its market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. This quarter, we received FDA approval for a new dosage strength of Creon. The new 36,000 lipase-unit dose is the highest available, which may help to reduce pill burden for some patients. This approval further strengthens our leadership position because we are able to offer patients the broadest range of dosage strength in the class. In 2013, we expect U.S. Creon sales to grow at a low-double-digit pace. Duodopa, a therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, performed well in the first quarter with growth of more than 8%. Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets. We completed registrational studies last year and are in the process of pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S. Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook. We are confirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.13. This guidance continues to contemplate sales somewhat above $18 billion, reflecting growth from key brands offsetting the expected decline in lipids. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of slightly less than 1%. We're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5% for the full year, excluding noncash amortization. This forecast reflects both the impact of ""loss of exclusivity"" events and the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange. We anticipate R&D expense to be approximately 14.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. And we expect SG&A to be around 26% of sales. We're forecasting net interest expense of approximately $300 million for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range excludes $0.37 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense and certain specified items primarily associated with separation-related costs and ongoing restructuring activities. Earnings per share would be $2.66 to $2.76 on a GAAP basis. We're still in the process of quantifying certain onetime costs relating to the separation, and we will look to further refine our forecast of these specified items as the year progresses. Finally, we expect approximately $6 billion of operating cash flow in 2013. Regarding our second quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.80. This excludes roughly $0.12 of specified items and noncash amortization, resulting in a second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.66 to $0.68. Our second quarter outlook reflects sales growth in the low single digits on a reported basis, including a modest impact from negative exchange. We expect the gross margin ratio for the quarter to be somewhat above our full year guidance. And we expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in line with our full year outlook. So in conclusion, we're pleased with our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry. Larry Peepo Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Elan, we'll take our first question."

Following Rick's comments, Bill will give a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2013 and the third quarter. Following our comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward- looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Richard A. Gonzalez Chairman & CEO Thank you, Larry. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with the reported strong second quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included strong operational sales growth of more than 5%, ahead of our outlook for the quarter, and adjusted gross margin ratios of more than 80%. We delivered this performance with strong and balanced growth across our product portfolio, despite the impact of generic competition. And today, we raised our full year EPS guidance for 2013, reflecting continued momentum from HUMIRA and better-than-expected results from our other pipeline products, including our lipid franchise. We're now 7 months into our first year as an independent company, and we continue to make good progress executing on our key business priorities, including maximizing HUMIRA's full growth potential and advancing our pipeline. Our second quarter performance was led by HUMIRA, which drove nearly 13% global operational growth. We continue to see strong underlying demand globally with particularly robust growth in dermatology and G.I. categories. As we've said previously, there are several factors we expect will continue to drive momentum, including increased biologic penetration rates, further geographic expansion and new indications. HUMIRA offers the broadest label in the category. Our expanding list of uses includes 9 approved indications in Europe and 7 in the U.S. And we have several indications currently in late-stage trials. All told, we expect new indications, including those approved in 2012, to add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global peak-year sales. HUMIRA's utility and label supporting use across the broader spectrum of autoimmune conditions is one of the many attributes that sets it apart from other products in this category. As we track new competitive entrants, performance continues to be in line with our expectations, with HUMIRA continuing to gain or hold market share across indications. As I said, HUMIRA is off to a strong start in the first half of the year. And as a result, we now expect global HUMIRA sales growth of 14% to 15% on an operational basis in 2013. This is an increase from our previous outlook of low-double-digit growth. Beyond HUMIRA, we also saw strong performance from several other products, including double- digit growth of CREON, Synthroid, ZEMPLAR and Duodopa. Bill will provide more color on HUMIRA's performance, as well as some of the other products in our portfolio. So today, I'll spend some time discussing a few of our pipeline programs. Certainly, pipeline development is critical to our long-term success, and we're very pleased with the progress we've seen across our mid- and late-stage pipeline programs so far this year. Over the past year, in the past several months, we've also presented important data that support our advancing pipeline and illustrate its potential to address some of the most pressing areas in medical need. I'll start with our late-stage HCV program where we recently completed enrollment in all 6 of our Phase III studies that will be included in our initial regulatory submissions. Over the past several months, we presented additional data from our large Phase IIb Aviator study, which enrolled, as a reminder, 571 non-cirrhotic patients. Data presented at the EASL and DDW meetings showed patients with high SVR cure rates, regardless of baseline characteristics associated with [indiscernible] response to interferon therapies, including baseline viral load and level of fibrosis. As I said before, our goal is to maximize SVR rates across various patient types, from naive patients to the most difficult to treat, with the simplest possible therapy. And the large body of data that we've collected and presented thus far certainly support our objective. Recently, our direct-acting antiviral combination was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA, underscoring its promise in the treatment of HCV. As I've said, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making in our Phase III program. We expect registrational studies to begin to read out later this year and early into 2014, supporting regulatory submission in the second quarter of 2014 and market entry in the early 2015. In addition to our late-stage efforts, we're also advancing a compelling next-generation HCV program, including a potent protease inhibitor, ABT-493, and a new NS5A inhibitor, ABT-530. In preclinical studies, these promising assets have shown pan-genotypic activity, an excellent activity against key resistant mutants. These next-generation assets also support once-daily dosing as well as the ability to co- formulate. Our development program is progressing well, and we're on track to be in Phase II studies this year. Suffice to say, we are very committed to this therapeutic category, and we'll continue to work to evolve the treatment paradigm. Now turning to our oncology pipeline, which includes several mid- and late-stage assets in development for more than a dozen different cancers. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings, we presented additional data on ABT-199, our first-in-class BcL-2 inhibitor in development in partnership with Roche/Genentech. These data showed strong single-agent activity across a number of hematological malignancies, including CLL, NHL and mantle cell lymphoma. We recently started a large Phase II single-agent, single-arm study in relapse refractory CLL patients with 17p chromosome deletion. We believe this study has the potential to be a registrational trial and plan to engage with the FDA to confirm our view. While these patients represent the most difficult to treat, early data have been promising. In collaboration with our partner, we also expect to begin a Phase III comparative trial. A combination study in relapse refractory CLL that will evaluate ABT-199 plus RITUXAN versus RITUXAN plus chemotherapy. We plan on starting that in the next 6 to 9 months. We believe that ABT-199 represents a potentially transformational approach to the treatment of CLL and other hematological malignancies and are working to quickly advance this asset. Now moving to our next oncology asset, ABT-888, our PARP inhibitor. We believe this compound holds promise in enhancing the effectiveness of common chemotherapy and radiation. We have a number of mid-stage studies underway, including trials evaluating 888 plus chemotherapy in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, as well as a study of 888 in combination with whole brain radiation in patients with brain metastases. We'll learn much more about the efficacy and utility of this compound as we expect a number of studies to complete over the next 6 to 12 months. It's likely that we'll initiate Phase III studies with ABT-888 in this same time frame as well. Moving on to ABT-126, our alpha7 NNR agonist in development for Alzheimer's and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia or CIAS. Earlier this month, results from our initial Phase IIa proof of concept study in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's dementia were presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. These data demonstrated evidence that ABT-126 treatment effect on measures of cognition were present, as well as a safety and tolerability profile that supports continued development. We're exploring a higher-dose range in our ongoing Phase IIb study, where we're evaluating ABT-126 both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care. The Phase IIb trial results are on track to complete later this year, and if successful, we plan to start a Phase III development in 2014. We're also actively evaluating ABT-126 in mid-stage trials for CIAS. We'll present Phase IIa proof of concept data for this indication in 2014, and the ongoing Phase IIb study will read out next year as well. Now moving on to atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in development for diabetic kidney disease, a common complication of diabetes and the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the developed world. We presented results from our Phase IIb study at the European Renal Association Congress in May. The mid-stage trial showed treatment with atrasentan showed significant and sustained reduction of albuminuria, the presence of protein in your urine, a symptom that is predictive of renal function. We recently initiated a large global Phase III program, which will evaluate the impact of atrasentan on renal outcomes, such as onset of end-stage renal disease, transplant or death due to renal failure progression. This study will serve as a single global registration trial for the compound. Well, I won't cover our entire pipeline today. We have a number of other promising products in development, which I'll mention briefly here. Daclizumab, currently in Phase III development in partnership with Biogen for multiple sclerosis. Our second pivotal study will read out next year and we're planning global registration submissions in 2014 as well. Elagolix is being evaluated in Phase III for endometriosis and in Phase IIb for uterine fibroids. We have mid-stage trials on ABT-719 for acute kidney injury, which are ongoing. We have 2 select JAK2 inhibitor programs in development for autoimmune diseases, including our partnered asset with Galapagos, as well as an internal candidate, ABT-494, and we have a number of other exciting programs. I'll conclude my remarks this morning with an update on our licensing activity, where we continue to be very active. We recently entered into a global collaboration with Alvine Pharmaceuticals to develop a novel mid-stage oral compound for the treatment of celiac disease, a common autoimmune disorder. The compound ALV003 is currently in Phase II development and has the potential to be the first therapy to treat celiac disease. Currently, there are no approved therapies for this condition, and the only option for patients is to attempt to follow a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. Total exclusion of dietary gluten is difficult because gluten is one of the most common food ingredients. Further, despite a gluten-free diet, up to 60% of celiac patients still have symptoms, underscoring the acute need for non-dietary therapies. Alvine will begin a Phase IIb study for this promising compound in the coming months. We also recently extended our clinical development collaboration with Galapagos to include Crohn's disease. Galapagos plans to begin a Phase II in this indication by early 2014. The Phase II program in Crohn's will be performed in parallel with the Phase IIb study in rheumatoid arthritis, which was recently initiated. So in summary, we're pleased with our performance in the first half of 2013. In the second quarter, we saw another strong performance across our portfolio, including double-digit growth from HUMIRA, CREON, Duodopa, ZEMPLAR and Synthroid. We delivered higher-than-expected gross margin ratios, and we continued strong levels of investment spending across both our marketed products and our pipeline opportunities. And we made significant progress advancing our pipeline. We presented compelling data on a number of compounds. We've moved a promising asset into Phase III development, and we augmented our mid-stage pipeline with 2 opportunities to build upon our expertise and our leadership in the G.I. field. We expect continued pipeline advancement over the next 12 to 18 months, including late-stage trial completions, regulatory filings and new product approvals. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. William J. Chase Executive Vice President of Finance & Administration Thank you, Rick. Today, I'll spend some time talking about our second quarter performance, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2013. As Rick said, we feel very good about the strong quarter and year- to-date performance we have delivered. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $0.82, exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.66. Total sales in the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis, which exclude non-favorable 0.7% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding TriCor and Trilipix, which are experiencing a loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 10.3% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by HUMIRA, which had global sales of more than $2.6 billion, up nearly 13% on an operational basis. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 16%, driven by continued market expansion and share gains in dermatology and gastroenterology. We've been particularly impressed with HUMIRA's performance in the gastro segment following our strong UC launch, where we've already gained significant share globally. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 10.1% on an operational basis. As expected, we saw a modest negative impact from tender timing in some markets, particularly Brazil. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect global HUMIRA sales to grow in line with our updated full year outlook of 14% to 15%. AndroGel sales were $258 million in the quarter, down 6.5% versus the prior year. AndroGel continues to maintain roughly 60% share of the testosterone replacement market. Sales this quarter reflect the year- over-year impact of rebating actions implemented in mid-2012 and certain account losses. We are now forecasting full year AndroGel sales to be roughly flat versus 2012 levels. Moving onto our lipid franchise, we saw a stronger-than-expected performance in the second quarter, particularly with Niaspan and Trilipix. U.S. sales of Niaspan were $232 million, up 10% versus the second quarter of 2012. TriCor/Trilipix sales were $107 million, down 66% due to the entry of generic fenofibrate in November of 2012. We continue to forecast 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion. As we've said previously, this decline will be most pronounced in the fourth quarter of this year due to the expected entry of generic competition for Niaspan in September and the recently announced entry of generic Trilipix earlier this month. Global sales of Lupron were nearly $200 million in the second quarter. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintain significant share of the market. For the full year 2013, we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2012. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $153 million in the quarter, up strongly. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership, despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. U.S. sales of CREON were $106 million in the quarter, up more than 20% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Performance in the quarter was impacted by the launch of our new 36,000 lipase-unit dose. CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market, where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. For the full year 2013, we expect CREON sales to grow at a double-digit pace. Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, which is currently approved in Europe and other international markets, performed well in the second quarter with growth of nearly 23% on an operational basis. We are pursuing regulatory approval for this product in the United States and expect a PDUFA date in the first half of 2014. Moving on to our P&L profile. Second quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.7%, excluding intangible asset amortization and other specified items. This was above our expectations for the quarter due to the impact of product mix across our portfolio, including better-than-expected performance of our lipid franchise, which as you know, includes some of our highest margin products. Adjusted R&D was 14.8% of sales in the second quarter, driven by increased funding of our mid- and late- stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. Adjusted SG&A was 27.9% of sales in the second quarter, reflecting heightened investment across our growth brands. Net interest expense was $75 million in the quarter, and other income was $7 million. The adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in the second quarter. Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $3.07 and $3.13. This updated guidance contemplates sales of approximately $18.5 billion, reflecting strong, balanced performance across our portfolio, offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of approximately 1%. Given our performance year-to-date, including the better-than-expected sales of our high-margin lipid franchise, we are now forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 77.5% for the full year, excluding non- cash amortization and specified items. In addition to raising our EPS guidance, our performance this year has also allowed us to increase the level of investment behind both our pipeline opportunities and marketed products. As a result, we now expect R&D expense to be approximately 15% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline. And we now expect SG&A expense to be around 26.5% of sales in 2013, reflecting increased investment for continued growth of our key brands, including HUMIRA, where we have identified opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications. We continue to forecast net interest expense of approximately $300 million for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range excludes $0.41 per share of non-cash intangible amortization expense, acquired in-process R&D and certain specified items primarily associated with separation and ongoing restructuring activities. We expect that earnings per share will be $2.66 to $2.72 on a GAAP basis. Regarding our third quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.78. This excludes roughly $0.13 of specified items and non-cash amortization, resulting in a third quarter GAAP EPS of $0.63 to $0.65. Our third quarter outlook reflects sales growth in the low-single digits on a reported basis, including a modest negative impact from exchange. Our sales guidance for the third quarter includes the estimated impact of Trilipix going generic earlier this month and Niaspan going generic in September. We expect the gross margin ratio for the quarter to be somewhat above our revised full year guidance, and we expect R&D and SG&A, as a percentage of sales, to be in line with our revised full year outlook. So in conclusion, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance in our first 6 months as an independent company, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry Peepo Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call up for questions. Elan, we'll take our first question."
141,GV_016101_2013Q3,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.

Richard A. Gonzalez Chairman & CEO Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. Our performance demonstrates the strength and durability of our portfolio, as we delivered these results despite the continued impact of generic competition on our lipid franchise. Today, we also raised our full year EPS guidance for 2013, reflecting the high level of execution we've demonstrated this year. As we embarked on this year, we set forth several key priorities for our business, including a seamless transition to operating as an independent entity, maximizing the performance of our current product portfolio, advancing our pipeline, including our late-stage HCV program and other key assets, and delivering operational efficiencies. As we assess our progress, I believe we have met or exceeded expectations on our strategic objectives. I'm pleased with the performance of our product portfolio, including HUMIRA, which delivered more than 19% global operational growth in the quarter. This strong growth was driven by several factors, including continued robust market growth, resulting from increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies; market share gains, particularly in the GI segment, where our UC launch is progressing ahead of our expectations; and we delivered this performance despite the entry of new competitors into the category. As we've indicated in the past, HUMIRA's broad label and new indications are a competitive advantage, and UC is the latest example of that. We launched UC indication in a number of key countries, and it quickly gained meaningful market share. And we're working to secure market access and reimbursement in a number of additional markets in the coming months. To date, in Western Europe, we're currently capturing roughly 25% of the UC market, and in the U.S., the UC indication has contributed significantly to our strong performance in the IBD market, as HUMIRA is now the market-leading biologic in the GI category. We continue to pursue HUMIRA in several other indications, which are currently in late-stage developments. Earlier this month, we presented Phase II data in patients with HS, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Our Phase III trials are fully enrolled, and we're targeting commercialization of this indication in the 2015 timeframe. Given the lack of effective treatment options, we believe HS could represent a several hundred million dollar peak year opportunity for us. HUMIRA continues to gain or hold market share across all indications. As I mentioned earlier, our strong UC launch has helped us attain the #1 position in the GI category. We also hold the #1 market share position in dermatology and we continue to hold steady share in rheumatology, despite the entry of new competitors. We've been very pleased with HUMIRA's exceptional performance this year, and we're well on track to achieve our 2013 guidance for the product. Beyond HUMIRA, we also saw a strong performance from several other products, including Creon, Synthroid, Zemplar, Synagis and Duodopa. Though certainly not as high profile as HUMIRA, we've been pleased with the performance of these durable and growing brands. In the quarter, we also made good progress on other key strategic objectives. We continue to drive operational efficiencies, including gross margin improvement, which Bill will discuss in more detail in his remarks. And we've begun the process of creating our own efficient back-office infrastructure that is more appropriate for an independent biopharmaceutical company. In addition to our strong commercial and operational performance, we've also made significant progress on our pipeline, where we have placed a tremendous amount of focus. As we evaluate our pipeline prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the healthiest it has ever been. In addition to assets currently in late stage, such as HCV, daclizumab, elagolix, atrasentan and elotuzumab, we're on the cusp of transitioning several additional programs into Phase III development, including, but not limited to, ABT-199 for CLL and ABT-888 for SELECT solid tumors. And we expect continued pipeline advancement between now and the end of 2014, including late-stage trial completions, regulatory filings and new product approvals. Let me now provide you with an overview of some of the key highlights in our pipeline. We expect numerous HCV data milestones to be achieved, including the results from our 6 Phase III interferon-free combination studies starting later this year and into early 2014. We will also present data from these studies at EASL in April and other medical meetings throughout the course of 2014. We remain on track with our U.S. and EMA regulatory submissions in the second quarter of 2014. In anticipation of an early 2015 commercialization, we are actively building the appropriate infrastructure, including medical affairs personnel and our sales organizations. We'll present data from our Phase II HCV program in Asia and plan to start our Phase III program in Japan in the first half of 2014. Japan represents the second-largest HCV market globally, and we believe we're well positioned relative to competitive offerings. Given the prevalence of genotype 1b in the region, we plan to advance our 12-week 2-DAA treatment in this area. We also have strong commercial presence in Japan, which we've -- has been in place for a number of years. We remain on track to start our Phase II studies of our next-generation HCV compounds by the end of this year. As a reminder, our next-generation assets include a potent protease inhibitor, ABT-493, and our new NS5A inhibitor, ABT-530. In preclinical studies, these promising assets have shown pan-genotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistance mutants. These assets also support once-daily dosing, as well as the ability to co-formulate. Commercialization of our next-generation compounds could occur in the 2017 timeframe. Now moving to our oncology pipeline. We'll see continued data flow from our BcL-2 inhibitor, ABT-199. The Phase II single-agent study in previously treated CLL patients with 17p deletion will likely read out at the end of 2014. Additionally, the Phase III comparative study of ABT-199 plus RITUXAN versus RITUXAN plus chemotherapy in patients with relapsed refractory CLL will begin in early 2014. The ongoing studies of ABT-199 will continue to collect data, and in 2014, we'll present data demonstrating the durability of the treatment effect. We also expect to present combination treatment data, as well as results from some of our ongoing studies in other cancer types. A number of our mid-stage studies of our PARP inhibitor, ABT-888, will also read out in the coming months and throughout 2014, beginning with data that will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium this December. From our neuroscience pipeline, in 2014, we'll present data from our alpha7 NNR agonist, ABT-126, which is currently being studied in Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We'll also see data from the second of our 2 registrational studies for daclizumab in mid-2014. As a reminder, that study, the DECIDE trial, is somewhat unique in that it's designed to show reduction of annualized relapsed rates and disability progression in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis versus an active comparator. Assuming favorable results, we plan to submit the regulatory application for daclizumab in the second half of 2014. We'll also see initial data from the first of 2 pivotal studies of elagolix in endometriosis in the second half of 2014. And finally, we look forward to seeing Phase IIb data in RA from our partnered selected JAK1 inhibitor late next year. We continue to augment our pipeline through a concerted, focused effort on strategic licensing, acquisitions and partnering activity. We've targeted large and growing specialty-focused therapeutic areas that enhance our current franchises and our emerging pipelines. In the recent years, we've added more than a dozen promising assets to our portfolio. Last month, we announced 2 new collaborations. First, we entered into a global licensing agreement with Ablynx to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-6 nanobody for autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Early clinical work in RA has shown promise and given the molecules' unique characteristics, we believe there is room for therapeutic differentiation here. In addition, we entered into a global alliance with Galapagos to discover and develop novel therapies for cystic fibrosis, but there's still a significant unmet need. In closing, as we approach the end of our first year as an independent company, we feel very good about the progress we've made executing our key strategic priorities. We're pleased with our performance this quarter where we saw a strength across our portfolio, including double-digit growth from HUMIRA and growth from a number of other products. We're taking the necessary steps to build a more efficient organization as we move to a fully independent operating environment beginning in 2015. And we've made significant progress advancing our pipeline and look forward to a number of key milestones in the months ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results. Bill? William J. Chase Executive Vice President of Finance & Administration Thank you, Rick. This morning, I'll start with an overview of our third quarter performance, and then I'll provide an update to our 2013 outlook. In addition to delivering strong top line growth in the third quarter, we again exceeded our earnings per share guidance. Third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.82, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.60. Total sales in the third quarter increased 3.6% on an operational basis, which excludes an unfavorable 0.3% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding TriCor/Trilipix, which are experiencing a loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 10.9% on an operational basis. Third quarter growth was led by HUMIRA, which had global sales of nearly $2.8 billion, up 19.1%. As Rick mentioned, we continue to see a positive impact from the launch of the UC indication, which has helped us gain significant share in the global gastro market. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 22.3%, reflecting continued robust market expansion, as well as share gains in dermatology and gastroenterology. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 16% on an operational basis with many markets continuing to grow strong double digits. Share gains and continued uptake of new indications are contributing to the growth. International sales in the quarter also benefited to some extent from the timing of tenders. As a result, we're forecasting slower international HUMIRA growth in the fourth quarter. AndroGel sales were $248 million in the third quarter, down 11.1% versus the prior year, reflecting continued moderation of market growth, rebating actions from the second half of last year and certain account losses in early 2013. AndroGel remains the testosterone replacement market leader with more than 60% share and achieved share gains in the last quarter. As expected, all the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. U.S. sales of Niaspan were $201 million, down 13.4% due to the launch of a generic niacin in mid-September. TriCor/Trilipix sales were $39 million, down 88.3% versus the third quarter of 2012. Though sales across the lipid franchise declined in the third quarter, they did perform better than we had forecast. We continue to expect full year 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid portfolio, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion. As we said previously, this decline will be most pronounced in the fourth quarter when the full impact of Niaspan's loss of exclusivity will be felt. Global Lupron sales were nearly $196 million in the quarter, up 4.2% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold the leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $161 million in the quarter, up 22.9%. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. U.S. Creon sales were $101 million in the third quarter, up 9.8%. The launch of our 36,000 lipase unit dose earlier this year continues to positively impact sales performance. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to captured the vast majority of new prescription starts. We expect double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2013. Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 18.9% on an operational basis this quarter. Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets. Moving onto our P&L profile. Third quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 79.7%, excluding intangible asset amortization and other specified items. This was above our expectations for the quarter driven by operational efficiencies and product mix across our portfolio, including HUMIRA and better-than-expected performance of our high-margin lipid franchise. Adjusted SG&A was 26.1% of sales in the third quarter, in line with our expectations and reflecting heightened investment of our growth brands. Adjusted R&D was 15.2% of sales in the quarter, driven by increased funding of our emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. Net interest expense was $79 million -- $69 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3%. Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $3.11 to $3.13. This updated guidance contemplates sales somewhat above $18.5 billion, reflecting strong balance performance across our portfolio, offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of somewhat less than 1% for the full year. We are now forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 78% for the year, excluding noncash amortization and specified items. This reflects our efforts to improve operational efficiencies, as well as product mix, including the better-than-expected sales of our lipid franchise in the first 3 quarters. In addition to raising our EPS guidance, our performance this year has also allowed us to increase the level of investment behind both our pipeline opportunities and marketed products. As a result, we now expect R&D expense to be somewhat above 15% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline. And we now expect SG&A expense to be approximately 27% of sales in 2013, reflecting increased investment in our key brands, including HUMIRA, where we're pursuing opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $280 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the year excludes $0.57 per share related to amortization expense, acquired IPR&D and ongoing separation and restructuring costs. We expect that earnings per share will be $2.54 to $2.56 on a GAAP basis. Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect sales approaching $5 billion, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline on a reported basis, which includes a negative impact from exchange of approximately 0.5%. Our sales guidance for the fourth quarter includes continued impact of the loss of exclusivity for TriCor/Trilipix, as well as the full impact of Niaspan going generic since this occurred late in the third quarter. We expect the adjusted gross margin ratio for the quarter to be around 77%. We are forecasting fourth quarter SG&A somewhat below our full year estimate, and we expect R&D to be somewhat above our revised full year guidance. So in conclusion, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance again this quarter, as well of our outlook for the remainder of the first year as an independent company. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry Peepo Former Vice President of Investor Relations Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call up for questions.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick. Richard A. Gonzalez Chairman & CEO Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to AbbVie's quarterly conference call. It certainly has been a historic time for our company. The major transformation that began more than a year ago is now a reality. We're pleased with the performance that AbbVie delivered in 2012, as Abbott's proprietary pharmaceutical business. Despite continued challenges in the healthcare industry and the global economy, our differentiated portfolio delivered another exceptional year with strong performance from several products, including HUMIRA. And as we announced this morning, we expect adjusted 2013 EPS of $3.03 to $3.13, in line with the profile we outlined on the third quarter call last October and at a health care conference earlier this month. Over the past several months, through our roadshows, meetings and other communications, we've been very active in discussing our strategic vision, our outlook and our unique identity with the investment committee. That identity includes several key attributes: a diverse portfolio of assets, including many products that hold leadership positions within their categories and support a sustainable revenue line; a compelling new product pipeline, including several promising late-stage programs with significant peak year revenue potential; a continued focus on driving efficient operations; and a financial policy that balances both the short and long-term to ensure we are a compelling investment now and well into the future. This includes strong operating cash flow to support an attractive dividend, providing investors with a strong return on investment. We have met with a significant number of investors and there has been a great deal of enthusiasm on our prospects as an independent entity, and we certainly share in that enthusiasm. While Bill will cover the details of our recent performance, I will say that I'm very pleased with the strong growth delivered, both in the fourth quarter and the full year 2012. Worldwide proprietary pharmaceutical operational sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.5%. And for the full year 2012, worldwide operational sales grew 8.2%, despite the entry of generic TriCor in the fourth quarter. In addition to our strong sales growth, we achieved our other key priorities for the year, executing on our regulatory and clinical objectives. This includes securing approvals for several new HUMIRA indications and advancing key development programs, including the start of our HCV registrational trials. Our strong performance was led by HUMIRA, where we added more than $1 billion in sales growth in 2012. Not many brands are able to achieve and sustain the level of performance we demonstrated with HUMIRA. HUMIRA has a strong clinical profile that drives meaningful patient benefit in a broad spectrum of indications, and our commercial development and regulatory execution has been outstanding. A number of factors will drive continued growth, including the addition of new indications, increasing penetration, geographic expansion and share gains. HUMIRA currently offers the broadest label in the category with 9 approved indications in Europe and 7 approved indications in the U.S. We secured several regulatory approvals in 2012, including UC in the U.S. and Europe; axial SpA in pediatric Crohn's disease in Europe. We continue our development efforts for HUMIRA, with a number of new indications currently in late- stage trials. Several new uses will be unique to our label, and will help further differentiate us from our competitors. They will also add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. All told, we expect new indications, including those approved in 2012, to add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global peak sales. Another significant driver of growth going forward will be increasing global biologic penetration rates, which are still relatively modest across all segments. In particular, there is room for further penetration in the dermatology category, where penetration rates are still in the mid-single digits worldwide. A third source of growth will be continued share gains. Over the past year, we've captured significant market share globally in dermatology and GI, while holding steady share in rheumatology. Finally, HUMIRA growth will also be driven by further geographic penetration in underserved markets around the world. And while much has been said about the potential changes in the competitive landscape in the coming years, we have planned for these factors, and we continue to have a high level of confidence in HUMIRA given its extensive clinical track record and strong product profile. As we track new product entrants, performance is in line with our expectations. So as we think about HUMIRA's performance this year, we expect to deliver low-double-digit reported growth in 2013, and we're confident HUMIRA will continue to drive durable growth and cash flow generation for many years to come. In addition to HUMIRA, we have a rich portfolio of medicines, including a mix of differentiated growth brands and sustainable performers. We hold strong leadership positions across a number of therapeutic categories with products such as AndroGel, Lupron, Synagis, Creon, Synthroid and our antiviral medicines, Kaletra and Norvir. We're focused on maximizing the performance of our entire portfolio. We have structured our specialty commercial teams for efficiency and agility, and we will leverage our competitive advantages and capitalize on market dynamics. This includes continued geographic expansion, where we expect to add approximately $1 billion in incremental sales over the next 5 years from the emerging markets. As an independent biopharmaceutical company, advancing our pipeline underpins the long-term success of our business. We are focused on delivering transformational medicines. The compounds currently in late- stage development offer significant patient benefits and clinical value propositions and have the potential to drive significant peak year revenue. We're focused on delivering truly innovative medicines to address some of the most pressing unmet clinical needs, and we're extremely encouraged with our progress on this front. We're actively working to obtain 15 major regulatory approvals between 2013 and 2017. Our late-stage pipeline, includes 11 compounds or indications in Phase III development, focused on therapeutic areas, including Hepatitis C, immunology, multiple sclerosis, endometriosis and Parkinson's disease. The flagship of our late-stage pipeline is our interferon-free HCV combination. We have made significant progress with our program, and we continue to have a high level of confidence that AbbVie has the potential to achieve a strong leadership position in this therapeutic area. It is our goal to be first to market with an interferon-free treatment for HCV genotype 1 patients. Today, only a fraction of patients diagnosed with HCV are being treated and cure rates remain unacceptably low. With the introduction of new interferon-free treatments, we expect that the market will grow significantly. And because patients will be cured with a much shorter course of therapy, physicians will have the capacity to treat more patients. Beginning with those that need it the most, such as null responders to prion interferon-free based therapy and patients with evidence of advancing liver disease. We recently initiated our comprehensive genotype 1 registrational program, which includes the study of naive in interferon-experienced patients, as well as certain special populations. We're also conducting additional exploratory clinical trials to determine if a once daily ribavirin-free treatment can provide high cure rates in several HCV-infected population, including patients with genotype 1b, the most common genotype in Europe and Japan. As we look ahead to 2013, we expect to present additional subpopulation analysis from our Phase IIB aviator trial. Our Phase III program is well underway and enrolling rapidly. We expect our Phase III studies to begin to read out later this year, supporting a mid-2014 registration submission and market entry in early 2015. Also moving into Phase III following a successful completion of our Phase IIB program is atrasentan, an internally discovered compound in development for diabetic kidney disease. Phase II data have demonstrated efficacy in reducing protein in the urine, a symptom that is often predictive of renal function. We expect to present results of our Phase IIB study in a Medical Congress this year. Also in our late stage pipeline is daclizumab, a next-generation biologic in development with Biogen for multiple sclerosis. Results from the first of 2 pivotal trials demonstrated strong efficacy in reducing relapse rates and disability performance. Results from the second pivotal trial, which is fully enrolled in progressing well are expected in 2014. Elagolix is a compound in Phase III development for endometriosis, a prevalent condition with few treatment options. It has a unique profile with the potential to provide symptom reduction, while avoiding significant bone loss or other adverse effects, that can sometimes be associated with current treatments. Elagolix is also in mid-stage development for uterine fibroids and we expect to initiate a Phase IIB study this year. Elotuzumab is in development for multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer. Led by our partner, Bristol Myers Squibb, data presented at the American Society of Hematology meeting showed promising disease progression results in patients treated with elotuzumab and standard of care. Duopa is a therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, Phase III data showed a decrease in periods of poor mobility, slowness and stiffness. Duopa, known as Duodopa outside the U.S., is approved in Europe and we are pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S. We also continue to make significant progress advancing compounds in our mid-stage pipeline. Several of these promising assets have already established strong proof of concept and are poised to move into Phase III over the next 12 to 18 months. For example, ABT-199 our next generation BCL-2 inhibitor has shown strong activity in hematological malignancies. We're planning to present additional Phase I data at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in April and at ASCO in June. And we anticipate to initiate a Phase III trial in CLL this year. ABT-888, our PARP inhibitor, has shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of common cancer therapies. It is currently in a Phase IIB trial for BRCA-deficient breast cancer and other cancers. ABT-126, our alpha-7 agonist, currently in Phase IIB trials for Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We expect to present Phase IIB in Alzheimer's this year at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference. And we also have an active mid-stage immunology program with the goal to deliver differentiated efficacy and safety relative to current available options for conditions such as RA. We have partnered with Galapagos to develop a next-generation, highly selective JAK1 inhibitor. Data from a multicenter Phase IIA study will be presented at EULAR. As you can see, our pipeline includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to address significant medical need. For a company of our size, the potential sales projections from a late-stage pipeline, represent a significant opportunity for meaningful revenue growth beginning in the 2015 time frame. So in summary, we've set an excellent foundation for AbbVie. We have a strong base of sustainable leadership positions across our specialty focused commercial portfolio, including HUMIRA, which will continue to drive sustainable growth. We have a solid financial foundation, including strong profitability and robust cash flow. We have a commitment to return cash to shareholders, including a strong and growing dividend. And we have a late-stage pipeline that is compelling, including several programs with $1 billion plus peak potential. We are looking forward to the next 12 to 18 months, as we expect a good deal of activity, including new regulatory filings and approvals, clinical trial advancement and data presentations, and we look forward to the ongoing dialogue with the investment community. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our 2012 performance and expected financial profile in 2013. Bill? William J. Chase Executive Vice President of Finance & Administration Thank you, Rick. As reported on Abbott's earnings release last week, we delivered very strong fourth quarter and full year sales results. Because our separation from Abbott occurred on January 1, 2013, our 2012 results were reported as part of Abbott's overall performance. I'd like to take some time this morning, however, to comment on the business' strong performance in the fourth quarter and 2012. I'll then turn to our outlook for 2013. Worldwide proprietary pharmaceutical sales in the fourth quarter increased 8.5% on an operational basis, excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. On a reported basis, global sales increased 7.4%. For the full year 2012, worldwide operational sales increased 8.2% and worldwide reported sales increased 5.5%. These results are indicative of the strong execution and performance of the business in 2012, despite the impact of generics on our lipid franchise in the fourth quarter. In 2012, HUMIRA delivered another outstanding year, driven by continued performance above market growth rates. The global HUMIRA franchise achieved sales of nearly $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, an increase of 24.5% on an operational basis and approximately 23% on a reported basis. Global HUMIRA sales for the full year 2012 were up more than 20% on an operational basis, and up nearly 17% on a reported basis. And as Rick mentioned, in 2013, we expect HUMIRA to continue its strong momentum and grow at a low-double-digit pace on a reported basis. AndroGel also exhibited impressive growth in the fourth quarter, consistent with strong underlying prescription trends. AndroGel holds the leadership position in the testosterone-replacement market, where growth has been driven by the increasing diagnosis and treatment of low testosterone levels in men. AndroGel 1.62%, our low-volume formulation, has quickly become the leading therapy in the market, now accounting for more than 60% of total AndroGel franchise sales. Full year 2012 sales of AndroGel were nearly $1.2 billion in the U.S. And in 2013, we expect AndroGel to grow at a double-digit pace, driven by continued favorable market trends. Global sales of HUMIRA were $211 million in the fourth quarter, driven by double-digit growth in the U.S. For the full year 2012, global Lupron sales were $800 million, roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. In 2013, we expect Lupron sales to be in line with 2012 performance. U.S. sales of Synthroid were nearly $170 million in the quarter and approximately $550 million for the full year, up roughly 6% versus 2011. Synthroid maintained strong brand loyalty and retains more than 20% market share, despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. In 2013, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits. U.S. sales of Creon were $105 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of nearly 4%. Full year 2012 sales were more than $350 million, an increase of 6.5% versus 2011. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market, where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. This year, we expect to launch a new formulation of Creon, which will reduce pill burden and further strengthen our leadership position. In 2013, we expect U.S. Creon sales to grow at a low-double-digit pace. Moving on to our lipid franchise, TriCor/TRILIPIX sales were approximately $200 million in the quarter, down roughly 50%, due to the entry of generic fenofibrates products in early November. This performance was in line with the guidance we provided on our third quarter call last year. U.S. sales of Niaspan were $277 million in the quarter, up about 7% on the quarter and down roughly 7% on a full year basis. It's clear that our 2012 performance has put us in a strong position to deliver on our financial goals. We have a strong sustainable base business that generates roughly $6 billion of annual operating cash flow. And we have a strong balance sheet with over $7 billion of cash on hand. These resources will allow us to invest in our business for the future, while at the same time, funding a strong $1.60 annualized dividend, which we intend to grow. And we have ample means to fund an increasingly exciting pipeline of medicines targeted in addressing therapeutic areas with high unmet need. However, as we've mentioned previously, 2013 and 2014 will be a time of transition for AbbVie as our Lipid franchise experiences the entry of generics. We expect generic entry events to play out during the year for TriCore/TRILIPIX and Niaspan, and we've planned for this appropriately. As a result, we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion. We plan to cover our lipid franchise decline through growth of key marketed products, including HUMIRA. So as we see it today, we expect AbbVie's total sales to remain somewhat above $18 billion in 2013, despite the generic events that are playing out in our lipid franchise. 2013 and 2014 will also be a time of transition as we establish our independent operations and install operating structures to allow us to fully stand on our own from Abbott, including an efficient back-office infrastructure. We're still in the process of quantifying certain onetime costs related to the implementation of these programs, and we'll update you throughout the year as we refine our estimates. I'd like to now provide more color on how we expect the business to perform in 2013. As Rick stated earlier, we expect full year adjusted earnings per share of a $3.03 to $3.13 in 2013. This guidance contemplates sales somewhat above $18 billion, with growth from key brands offsetting the expected decline in lipids. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of approximately 1%. We're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5% for the full year, excluding noncash amortization. This forecast reflects both the impact of loss of exclusivity events and the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange. We anticipate R&D expense to be approximately 14.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging mid- and late-stage pipeline assets, and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. This figure is above the 14% range communicated on our third quarter call and reflects the progress of our assets in the later stages of development. We expect SG&A expense to be around 26% of sales, including the incremental ongoing cost of becoming an independent company. As outlined in our Form 10 filing, we expect net interest expense of approximately $300 million in 2013. And we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013, including the impact of the 2013 R&D tax credit. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.13, excludes $0.37 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense, and certain specified items, primarily associated with a separation and previously announced restructuring activities. As stated earlier, we will look to further refine our forecast of specified items related to the separation as the year progresses. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per share guidance range would be $2.66 to $2.76. And as I mentioned, we expect approximately $6 billion of operating cash flow in 2013. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusting earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.64 to $0.66. This excludes roughly $0.10 of specified item and noncash amortization, resulting in a first quarter EPS in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 on a GAAP basis. Our first quarter outlook reflects sales growth in the low single digits range on a reported basis, despite the negative impact of generic competition in our lipid franchise. We expect the gross margin ratio of somewhat below our full year guidance due to product mix and the impact of foreign exchange in the quarter. And we expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be slightly higher than our full year outlook. This is reflective of the business' typical quarterly pattern, where first quarter EPS is typically lower than the remaining 3 quarters of the year. I'd like to now take a few final moments and discuss how we plan to report our performance during our first year of operations. In 2013, our quarterly results will be compared against a 2012 GAAP benchmark, which reflects the business as it existed when it was part of Abbott. As a result, the comparison of AbbVie's 2013 performance against the prior year will be impacted by significant differences in the tax rate, interest expense and the infrastructure costs associated with becoming a separate company. For this reason, we plan to focus our upcoming total discussions with our performance versus our communicated 2013 guidance of both adjusted EPS and our targeted P&L profile. We feel that this will be most useful to investors when trying to assess the underlying business performance of AbbVie. So in conclusion, we are quite pleased with our 2012 performance, and we believe that we are well-positioned for continued success as we move into 2013 as an independent company. Our financial footing is sound, with continued strong sales momentum across HUMIRA and our other specialty products, robust cash flow generation and an attractive dividend. And our pipeline is well-funded to ensure continued progress across our promising assets. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry. Larry Peepo Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take our first question."
143,GV_145977_2008Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts first quarter 2008 conference call.

Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson our President and CEO who will be followed by Elwyn Murray, EVP Customer Development Officer DIY, Jim Wade, EVP Customer Development Officer Commercial and finally Mike Norona, EVP and CFO. Darren. Darren Jackson Thanks Judd. Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter conference call of 2008. I’m happy to update you on the progress we’ve made on our turnaround during the first quarter. Specifically, I plan to share my observations on the strategy evolution, the leadership changes and provide some tangible examples of progress in our turnaround plan. Finally I plan a real life example of what our company will act like and look like when our turnaround strategies take hold throughout Advance. I wanted to start by personally thanking our Advance and AI team members for their terrific work in Q1 which resulted in a 21% increase in our earnings per share. The top line sales were in line with our expectations while the bottom line was above our plan. The starting point of the results began with the parts sum at last year where we learned directly from our team members on how to accelerate commercial sales. Our 10.6% commercial comparable store sales gain in the quarter was driven by the work and the other steps we took to support our team members as we focused on growing commercial sales. Similarly, our improvement in our cost structure resulted from last year’s efforts. Finally, our team is driven to win in this challenging economic environment. This play to win attitude put us over the top in the first quarter. I’m encouraged by our first quarter results. I’m also realistic that turnarounds by definition will have ups and downs. In Q1 our financial results ran ahead of plan while strategic results were on plan. The 100 plus days of our AAP turnaround is on track from my perspective. The goals in the first 100 days included listening, learning and leading. We made material progress in focusing the organization on our four turnaround strategies, specifically, commercial acceleration, DIY transformation, availability excellence and superior experience. The truth is, these strategies are an outgrowth of our core values of Advance and the input of our team members. The tangible results are just beginning to emerge. For example, commercial comps are accelerating and new brands, including MOOG, Wagner and Remy are arriving on our shelves. The inventory upgrades continued to surgically enhance our parts availability. Lastly, our employee turnover has improved significantly this year for our store teams, supply chain and at our corporate office. Practically we were in the formative stages of our transformation with considerable systemic and sustaining change ahead of us. I’m very excited about the leadership changes that we made this past quarter. The addition of our new CFO Mike Norona who will be the catalyst responsible for our growth stewardship, the formation of the commercial team led by Jim Wade and the DIY transformation led by Elwyn Murray, availability excellence led by Kevin Freeland, superior experience led by Ken Wirth and Mike Marolt, merchandising led by Charles Tyson and financial services led by Kevin Tobin. I’m also pleased to announce the addition of Donna Broome, Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales. I am confident the organizational changes will enable us to shift gears and close the gap between Advance and our competitors. They reflect the commitment to moving from words to action, from acknowledging to committing to change. I am confident this team of leaders will make it personal and possible for the entire team to succeed. The strategies are focused on what matters most, the customer. We will need to educate, engage and enable our team to build the capabilities to execute the strategy, starting with commercial acceleration. We have reorganized the company to have a fully dedicated commercial team led by Jim Wade. The premium brands which are critical to meeting the customer needs of commercial customers are now part of the mix and we will begin to evaluate and adjust our store labor models to reflect the commercial customer needs. Turning to the DIY transformation, we have started a 100 day intense business review with a strategic partner under Elwyn Murray to gain quick hits, including attachment selling. We need to jump start our front room with new category development, an appeal with “keep the wheels turning” brand campaign. The backbone of the strategy, our turnaround strategy is availability excellence. We have engaged a strategic partner to reengineer our supply chain and network capabilities, space management discipline and leverage the ecommerce platform under the direction of Kevin Freeland. Finally a key differentiator, superior experience, Ken Wirth and Mike Marolt will lead the rollout of the customer employee satisfaction initiative. In addition, they are charged with reawakening and revitalizing our trademark of legendary customer service built on a foundation of operational excellence. So what gives me hope and confidence as we continue the turnaround path? It is a team member like Regional Vice President Frank Miller. Frank, who has led a team from negative comp store sales last year, producing some of the highest comps in the company. Frank was a fairly new RVP last year who decided along with his team to turnaround their business by being best in class. He was inspired by his winning colleagues and sought out the guidance and assistance from them. Now he’s inspiring them. So how did Frank do it? Frank will be the first to tell you that credit goes to the team. They developed the plans and strategies very similar to what the entire company is embracing today. They aggressively addressed the commercial opportunities, focused on improving the DIY experience through legendary customer service and developed ways to empower the team. Frank did not make any excuses for the team’s previous results. They simply focused on changing those results and now this team is one of the best turnaround stories in the company. Frank and his team were focused on the company’s values and use them to guide every step of the journey. By doing so they went from trailing to exceeding within a year. And perhaps the most compelling part of this story is that if you ask Frank about his success, he will tell you there is still more work to do. The energy and results for this team are contagious and they are spreading. Thanks for letting me share this story with you. Frank, thanks again for a job well done. This story is the story of the future of Advance. Now I’d like to turn it over to Elwyn. Elwyn Murray Thank you Darren and good morning. In my time with you I would like to cover three things. First, I will reorient you to how we see the DIY space today. Second, I will share the definition and objectives of our DIY turnaround and transformation plan. Third and finally, I will provide an update on a number of initiatives we have underway now in order to reverse our DIY comp trends. As we have discussed before, we see the DIY industry growing at approximately 1% per year. It is a highly consolidated industry with the top seven players making up 66% of the market. New store growth is exceeding industry growth, leading to negative comps among major competitors. Customer traffic has shown single digit declines over the last several years and while partially offset by increasing sales per transaction has resulted in negative comp trends. All of this information tells us that DIY is in need of a major overhaul. The check engine light has been burning in DIY for several years now and it’s time that we answered the call. I’m very excited about the opportunity to lead our DIY turnaround and transformation and will now provide more insight regarding what this means to us and how we are pursuing this work. We have purposefully both included both the words turnaround and transformation in the definition of our DIY opportunity as there are things we are doing now and over the next 12 months to improve the customer experience and begin turning around our current trends. Additionally, we are focused on transforming the DIY space over the next 12-36 months by identifying and developing distinct value propositions intended to ignite demand by meeting and anticipating changing customer needs in the medium and longer term. Our objectives of this transformation are three fold. First, to attract and win more than our fair share of high priority customer segments, such as traditionalist, light users, Hispanics and new segments that are not in the space today. In order to achieve this we are focused on creating and delivering distinct value propositions to most of these attractive segments. Second, to capture the most from customers who visit our stores by maximizing every opportunity we have to serve, solve and sell them what they need in order to be successful with their respective projects. Third, to create nothing short of Advance Auto Parts fanatics who will return frequently and promote Advance to others. We will do this by defining what great customer service is at Advance and developing our team in order to achieve this on a consistent basis. We will measure out transformation success three ways. First, by increasing average DIY sales per store by 15% through increased traffic, improved conversion rates and large average transaction size driven largely by higher attachment rates. Second, by achieving market share leadership in the markets where we compete. Our aim will be to over-index with our targeted segments. And third, by achieving top quartile customer satisfaction and loyalty scores for retail comparisons. Finally, I will provide an overview of a number of initiatives that we have underway now in order to turnaround our DIY trends. We know what DIYers want, convenient locations, parts availability, knowledgeable in store service and quality parts at competitive prices. While Advance performs well with price oriented DIYers, we underperform with the attractive traditionalist customers who care most about parts availability and parts quality. We also underperform with light user customers who care most about convenient locations and in store service. We also have a significant opportunity to improve our business with the emerging Spanish speaking Hispanic population. We know we must improve our parts availability, product quality, in  store service, team member parts knowledge and bilingual staffing in order to meet the needs of these attractive segments. To respond to this demand and meet our customer’s needs, we have a number of strategies underway, including the following. We continue to improve our parts availability by expanding the breadth of our in store assortment as well as reengineering our supply chain to vastly improve our end market parts coverage. In the first quarter we introduced an incremental $45 million of hard parts and foresee the net addition of an incremental $125 million for the full year 2008. Also, we continue our pursuit of the highest quality brands with recent additions to our offering, including MOOG chassis and Wagner brakes. The addition of these brands enhances our ability to serve important customer segments within the do-it-yourself and commercial markets. We are intensifying our focus and efforts around attachment selling. More specifically, we are actively developing tools to ensure that our team members are equipped and incented to sell the complete solution so that our customers have everything they need in order to succeed. We continue our focus on enhancing parts knowledge. In the first quarter we completed a benchmarking study of parts knowledge within our stores and determined by category where we are strong and where we have opportunity to improve. We also identified the most frequently asked questions from our customers and determined by category where parts knowledge is most predictive of sales growth. We are actively deploying training efforts to improve parts knowledge in the areas that matter most. We continue our efforts to simplify our sales floor by rationalizing categories and SKUs while creating room to both increase our hard parts in store holding power and expand our product offering to capture more of the car and driver experience. As an example, we introduce navigation systems in the first quarter and now offer these devices in 1,000 of our stores and we look to grow our credibility in this space. We continue our efforts to effectively reach and serve the emerging Hispanic population. In 2008 we dramatically improved the quality of our marketing message tailored to Hispanic customers and increased the magnitude of our spend five times our 2007 levels in order to reach this important customer segment. Additionally, we increased our bilingual staffing levels by 16% in the first quarter of 2008 compared to Q1 2007 and still see much room for improvement here. We officially launched our “keep the wheels turning” branding strategy in the first quarter and continue to be pleased with the response we are getting from customers and team members. We will continue to evolve our messaging under this campaign and feel positive about the platform we have created. Tax rebate payments from the 2008 Economic Stimulus Act began reaching consumers this month and will continue until mid to late July. In order to maximize the sales opportunity for Advance, we have produced and are running special radio, television and online creative messages starting in May to entice customers to spend their rebate at Advance. Our message is focused on encouraging customers to use their stimulus checks to protect their four wheel investment by spending their rebate checks on those automotive projects or discretionary purchases that have been delayed out of economic necessity. In addition to the outbound messaging there will be in store signage communicating to customers that their tax rebate will go further if invested in their vehicle at Advance. Lastly we are in the early stages of creating visibility to customer satisfaction and team member engagement metrics. We are engaging a third party provider to start serving our customers and team members in the coming months. For our customers, we will be learning about the level of customer service they currently receive at our stores, defining what great looks like and developing our team to achieve higher loyalty scores with our customers. For our team members, we will be focused on how engaged and satisfied they are with their workplace. We know a highly engaged workforce aligned with a clear and common objective in our case to provide legendary customer service will create superior customer experiences, loyalty and thus increase profits. We are encouraged with the progress we are making with these initiatives as well as others not mentioned and see much room to improve within each of them. In conclusion, we will continue to accelerate execution of near term actions in order to reverse our current DIY trends. We anticipate solidifying our DIY transformation plan over the next 100 days and will provide further updates in coming calls. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Wade Thank you Elwyn and good morning. I’m pleased to be leading the acceleration of our commercial business as we grow it from less than 3% market share today to a much greater share of the market over the next several years. Also, I’ve never been more excited about our company’s future because we’re reinvigorating it based on our values around our team and our customers that make our customer successful over its long history. We have a great opportunity ahead of us and we control our own destiny in both our DIY and commercial businesses. Before I get too far into the details of where we’re going, I wanted to congratulate our entire store and commercial teams on their 10.6% increase in commercial comp in the first quarter. As you may remember, we committed ourselves to getting back to double digit growth about this time last year. Since then our team has increased the commercial comp consecutively each quarter. In addition to the solid comp, all our key commercial metrics improved, including higher average transaction, increased customer count, higher gross margin percent, increased productivity of our parts pros and delivery fleet and a higher balance of part sales. I’d also like to thank the auto part international team for a strong first quarter in sales and profitability as both their original base of stores as well as the new stores they’ve opened in the last two years performed well. Overall they produced a 14.2% comp for the quarter. As we look forward, we know we have the opportunity to further accelerate our commercial business and take it to a much higher percent of our total sales over the next several years while increasing our profitability as we lever the investments we’ve already made and will be making. We’re pleased but not satisfied with the first quarter commercial results because we know that that as we provide our team more tools to serve our customers better, they’ll capture more business. We’ll achieve this by building best in class capabilities that can differentiate how we serve the commercial customer. To achieve this objective, we’ve dedicated the full time and energy of some of our best team members and formed a commercial organization that is focused 100% on growing our commercial business. This team covers all key areas, including the sales force, customer management, merchandising, human resources, marketing, finance, IT and real estate. We’re also excited that Donna Broome is joining our team as Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales. With her experience leading a sales force of over 1,000 and achieving revenues of over $3 billion at Grainger and her 15 years of sales leadership with Xerox, she’ll lead our commercial sales force to achieve the full potential that we see for this business. As we’ve covered in our previous calls, we’ve done extensive research to identify how commercial customers make their purchasing decisions as well as determining where we rank in each of those key attributes. Our commercial customers rank us high in delivery time, which is at the top of the list of expectations they have for their parts supplier. Our investment in over 3,300 densely located stores in 40 states puts us very close to our garage customers and allows us to meet and exceed their expectations for delivery time. Our commercial customers have told us we need greater parts availability as well as more brands that are most highly rated by garages. As Elwyn discussed, we’re well on our way to addressing both of these opportunities but we expect to further build upon the strength significantly in the months and years to come. Delivering on our DIY strategies will also have a positive impact on our commercial business because the customer needs are aligned in so many ways. Our customers have also told us we need to increase our parts knowledge in our stores. We’re working very hard to provide our already strong store teams more opportunities to increase their parts knowledge through continued improvements in store systems and more training. From a customer standpoint, our existing commercial customers index higher towards smaller independent garages with one to three service bays relative to the total garage population. Our future growth is dependent upon continuing to meet these customer needs while further building our customer base with large independent garages along with national accounts. Additionally, we will continue to build our business around the basics. We’ll grow sales with the top customers that we’ve targeted in each store because we know it’s not about how many customers we have but instead the quality of the relationship with our core customers. We’ll build relationships with garages located closest to our stores. We know that with our large store base we can out service customers if we focus on garages in a tight radius of our stores. And we’ll build customer satisfaction by strengthening our investment in parts pros while leveraging our large delivery fleet. Over the coming months, our commercial organization will continue to strengthen our capabilities around the key attributes that drive customer purchasing decisions. We’ll also be formalizing our customer management tools and the tracking of key sales, profit and customer satisfaction metrics, all of which will be necessary to further accelerate our commercial growth. Switching to new store development, in the first quarter we opened 30 Advance stores and four Auto Part International stores as planned toward our target of 115 stores for the year. We also closed four Advance stores and relocated three. Our average new store sales in the first quarter exceeded our results for the same quarter last year. We’re continuing to identify significant opportunities to reduce our new store occupancy costs over time by 10-20%. We’re proceeding with finding store locations that will maximize both our convenience to our DIY customers while minimizing our delivery times to our garage customers. These locations don’t typically need to be main on main to achieve our customer’s desire for convenience and speed of delivery. As we move away from more expensive corner, our site costs are significantly reduced. We’ve also made a number of changes to our building specifications which will further reduce costs. Over the last six months we’ve tested smaller prototype buildings and different store layouts to optimize parts availability and sales floor needs. In mid 2008 we will begin rolling out our 6,000 square foot prototype as we open stores in many of our markets in place of our current 7,000 square foot prototype. I’ll close by saying that we look forward to providing further updates on our commercial acceleration and store growth over the quarters to come. Now let me turn the call over to Mike to review our financial results. Mike Norona Thanks Jim and good morning. I also would like to personally congratulate and recognize our talented and dedicated team members who positively and passionately impacted our business to deliver the results we saw this quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide an overview of our quarter one results. Two, connect our strategic priorities with our financial measures. And three, provide visibility to some other actions we have taken to improve our long term financial performance. Turning to the first quarter, total revenue increased 4% to $1.53 billion compared with revenue of $1.47 billion in the first quarter last year. This revenue increase reflected the net addition of 141 new stores in the past 12 months and a comp sales increase of 0.6% on top of a 0.7% increase last year. The comp store sales was comprised of a 10.6% increase in commercial sales, including Auto Part International, offset by a 3% decrease in DIY sales. This compares to a 4.2% increase in commercial and a 0.5% decrease in DIY in the first quarter last year. Commercial sales including Auto Part International represented 29% of our total sales compared to 26% last year. For the quarter, our total commercial sales including Auto Part International were $438.7 million, a 14.4% increase over last year. Consistent with the prior year, 82% of our Advance stores had commercial programs. Clearly our commercial teams are leading our company with these fantastic growth numbers, despite a tough economic environment. Our gross profit rate was 48.7% in the first quarter as compared to 48.3% last year which reflects a 39 basis point improvement. The 39 basis point improvement was driven by lower supply chain and logistics costs combined with more effective pricing. SG&A expenses were 39.3% of sales compared to 39.1% last year. This increase of 11 basis points was driven by deleverage due to modest comp sales and increased incentive compensation. These increases were almost entirely offset by cost reduction initiatives that were initiated during the second half of fiscal 2007. Interest expense net of interest income was $12.3 million in the quarter compared to $10.9 million last year. Our current borrowing cost is approximately 5%. Earnings per share increased 21% to $0.86 for the quarter as compared to $0.71 for the first quarter last year. This 21% EPS increase was primarily driven by a 7% increase in operating income and approximately 13 million shares repurchased over the past year. This is the first quarter in which our quarterly EPS has increased over 20% in over two years. As previously announced, the company repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares during the first quarter at an average price of $34.04 for a total expenditure of $155 million. In comparison, the company repurchased 8.3 million shares and 3.7 million shares in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively. As announced in our release, the Board authorized a $250 million share repurchase program. This new authorization replaces the company’s $500 million share repurchase program authorized in August 2007 which has $105 million remaining. We plan to buy back shares on an opportunistic basis. Let me now comment on a few items on our balance sheet and cash flows. For the quarter, inventory increased 4% which matched our sales increase of 4%. The increase in inventory was driven by our parts availability initiative which was somewhat offset by our focused plan to improve inventory productivity. Inventory per store was flat as compared to prior year. As you can see, we’ve been funding the majority of our parts availability initiative through some inventory reduction initiatives. In Q1, our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 58.6% compared to 57% last year. Our capital expenditures were $58.9 million for the quarter. This compares to $75.9 million last year or a reduction of $17 million driven by a decrease in store development as well as timing associated with the construction of a new distribution center. Overall our free cash flow increased in the first quarter to $150.5 million, an increase of $45.4 million compared to last year’s first quarter which was higher than we expected. Looking forward, we now expect our free cash flow to decrease more than we anticipate for the balance of the year based on decisions we made during the first quarter to make additional investments in inventory throughout the balance of the year. To put our first quarter results into context, our sales results came in on plan and our bottom line results exceeded plan. This was primarily driven by the growth in our commercial business, improvements in gross margin, better SG&A leverage versus last year and our share buybacks. In other words, our results were primarily driven by actions we initiated last year and fulfilled this year. These results provide us a clue of how important the actions we take today are to the financial results we deliver in the future. They are also a motivating force for our team as we undertake the exciting and challenging turnaround action we shared with you today. Now I’d like to connect the financial results to our strategic priorities. As you have heard, we have kicked off four strategic priorities and each one of those is in a different stage of evolution. Our commercial strategy is furthest along because it started last year and it did impact first quarter results with its 10.6% comp sales increase and it’s 14.4% total sales increase. It is also highlighting the importance of how focusing on the customer can drive our business. The other three strategies are at varying stages of evolution and had a less material impact on our first quarter results. As we have mentioned on this call, we are in the early stages of our strategy work and turnaround. We have much work to do in building out the details of our strategic plans and financial roadmaps, including investments required, turns expected, risk profile and timing. As those become available, we will share them with you appropriately. As you also heard on this call, we do have some early insights into each of our strategies to tell us we are focused on the right four areas. In order to measure the financial progress of our turnaround, we have identified four gauges of success. We believe these gauges provide a transparent and all encompassing view of our four strategic priorities and will be a barometer of our progress. These four gauges were shared with you in our press release. The first gauge is sales per square foot, it tells us, are we growing and optimizing. The second gauge is SG&A per store. That is, are we leveraging the investments we have made in our stores and will continue to make in opening new stores. The third gauge is operating income per team member or said different profit per employee. This gauge measures our productivity. We have 45,000 talented team members coming to work every day to do their best work and make our company a better place to serve customers and for employees to work. The final gauge is return on invested capital. This is, are we getting the appropriate returns on the investments we are making. This gauge is important given the future investments required for our turnaround in areas such as IT, supply chain and stores. As we look at these gauges today, we lag the industry and the market leader in all four. This is unacceptable. We have a real opportunity to take these metrics, turn them into insights and drive actions through the work we are doing in our four strategies. Our expectation is that we will get all four of these gauges to at or above the industry average. Longer term, we will look to lead our industry in these measures. As we continue to build the roadmaps of our strategies, we look forward to sharing more with you on our gauges. Finally, the company provides an annual outlook at the beginning of the year only which was an EPS of $2.55. However, as previously released, a 1% increase in comp sales adds approximately $0.10 in diluted EPS and a 10 basis point improvement in operating margins adds approximately $0.03 of incremental diluted EPS. We are pleased with our first quarter results but remain cautiously optimistic given the current economic headwinds and the fact that three quarters remain in our fiscal year. We also do not expect our results to be linear given we are still in the early stages of some of our strategic work and don’t have full visibility to the cost or investment profiles. We may also choose to accelerate investments if we determine it is better for the long term. An example of this is some of the decisions we made in our first quarter to increase our inventory for the balance of the year. Additionally, our turnaround approach entails an in depth assessment of all parts of our business, including our operating model, store profitability and processes. Correspondingly, this may create some short term earnings volatility as we position the company to increase the long term value. We will continue to instill discipline and be prudent as we make these decisions. In closing, we are excited about the long term prospects given our renewed focus on the customer. We believe we are focused on the right strategies and are confident our team members will lead us as these strategies evolve. We also are realistic and know that in any turnaround, there is significant work and are committed to transforming our company to ensure our turnaround is successful. We are now ready for questions.

Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now, let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our CEO who will be followed by Jim Wade, President; Kevin Freeland, Chief Operator Officer; and Mike Norona, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Darren R. Jackson Welcome to our first quarter conference call. I’d like to begin my congratulating the team on a great quarter and a great start to 2009. Our terrific results were driven by the efforts of our 49,000 team members. A year ago we began a turnaround and transformation story. Chapter one of our story focused on the customer, defining our four key strategies and revitalizing the core values of the brand. Fiscal 2009 is the second chapter of our transformation story and it builds on chapter one with a focus on enabling and empowering a great team. Our commitment and focus on the customer, team members and our core strategies are playing out in our results and the material investments to transform our business. Our confidence in our team members and the results allow us to move forward at an accelerated rate. To do this we must lead change, drive the business and reinforce the values of the company which are to inspire, serve and grow. As of today, I will share with you where we stand in our journey and our progress on our four strategies. To date, our strategic progress is in line with our high expectations yet, we have exceeded our expected financial outcome. Our commercial acceleration and availability excellent strategies have yielded significant gains in the quarter and the last 12 months. Strategically and financially the commercial sales growth and the gross margin have been outstanding. Our DIY transformation and superior experience strategies are building momentum as well. Candidly we are thrilled with the first quarter results in our DIY business but we need to be honest that the economic environment put some wind in our sales, literally. We are very encouraged about what the future holds for our superior experience strategy as we look out over the balance of the year and the foreseeable future. Collectively our strong start to 2009 coupled with the economic landscape is guiding us to accelerate investments to enable our customer focused sale culture which will fuel our future growth and strengthen the foundation of our business. Overall this year will resemble last year in terms of investment profile and pace and we will continue to balance our investments in areas that will yield immediate return and others focused on future returns. Looking out we will begin to leverage these investments as we turn the corner on 2010. There are countless areas of the business that I’m excited about that are not readily apparent in the press release. These include our continued improvement in our customer satisfaction scores, our meaningful market share gains in commercial and the uptick in our DIY share gain. The completion of our second team calibration survey, the 83% of our stores that had positive comparable sales growth in the quarter and the fact that we had nearly a dozen general managers on track to earn $100,000 this year under our new incentive compensation plan which pays for profitable sales growth. Collectively, our focus on growth, profitability, the customer and team members allowed us to increase sales 10.3% in the quarter, on a comp store sales increase of 8.2% while delivering bottom line earnings per share growth of 19% excluding the $0.04 impact of store divestitures. This is on top of a 21% EPS increase last year during the first quarter. Jim, Kevin and Mike will cover the details of our strategic and financial results. Turning to the economy, the economic environment continues to be a mixed blessing. We continued to be deeply concerned for many of our fellow Americans, customers, family members on account of the current economic crisis and confidence and a 25 year high unemployment rate. However, our industry and our role as a company continue to be important to meet the needs of our customers in these times. There is no doubt the trauma in this economic environment is showing up in our business and we are benefitting from it. Our entire industry has been benefitting from the tide rolling in on DIY. If the tide rolls back out the situation will be more challenging to navigate however, we are focused on achieving consistent performance whether the economy is in trauma or in great economic times. To that end, my top three priorities in 2009 start with our team members and their ability to lead change, build great teams and turn potential in to excellence. The changes we’ve made to our pay and rewards program are accelerating our success. In addition, we are seeing the results from our steps we are taking in customer satisfaction improved results as well. Collectively, the revitalization of our values, the transparent to uncomplicated focus on our strategies and how we manage and develop our teams in good times is making a big difference as well. I believe we are only scratching the surface on the potential of our company and our team members. If we continue to build great teams I’m excited about the promotion of Sarah Powell as General Counsel and the new leaders that have recently joined our company including Tammy [Kosakowski] as our Chief Development Officer and Scott Bauhofer as our eCommerce leader. These continued leadership changes are allowing us to spur innovation and increase the seed of getting strategy focus initiatives to market. The team’s focus on profitable sales growth and living our values continues to guide us individually and collectively in this transformation journey. I’d like to close with an example of what great looks like in our stores. [Sarah House] is the general manager of our store in Greenwood Mississippi. This store defined greatness in 2008 and is now driving double digit comps in both commercial and DIY as well as maintaining above average customer satisfaction scores for both commercial and DIY. District Manager [Willie Brown] shared with me that this store has a true passion for customer service and for growing the business. He described the store as setting the operational excellence standard. [Sarah] truly believes in the strategic direction of the company and rallies her team to take care of their customers, most of whom they know by name. [Reggie Flowers], the commercial parts pro, another member of this store team is a dynamic leader who serves his customers extraordinarily well. This team has achieved a true partnership between the DIY and commercial team resulting in a total store team being dedicated to and focused on taking care of their customers and their results reflect that. Congratulations team on a job well done. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Jim Wade to provide a progress update on our commercial acceleration and DIY transformation strategies. Jimmie L. Wade I’d also like to congratulate our store teams, our commercial sales force and our support teams on a great quarter. This morning I’ll update you on our progress with our commercial acceleration and DIY transformation strategies. Through our commercial acceleration strategy we continue to increase our sales and gain market share in the first quarter which we believe shows our strategy is working. With only about 3% market share there continues to be much more room for our growth. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in commercial with a 17.5% increase in comp store sales for the quarter. This increase was on top of a 10.6% comp sales increase in the first quarter of last year. As a result of commercial comp growth, our commercial sales mix increased over 30% for the first time ever. Also, I want to recognize our team for the strong growth in commercial gross margin percentage during the quarter. You are proving we can drive strong sales and margin by focusing on parts and providing great service. We remain fully committed to aggressively growing the commercial business and continuing to achieve double digit comps throughout 2009. Last quarter I shared our focus areas that are leading our acceleration in our commercial business. We continue to make progress in these focus areas. We continue to aggressively invest in parts pros, trucks and drivers in our stores and our markets with the greatest potential and with a proven track record of performance. We’ve identified our full potential commercial sales for each store which is the base from which these investment decisions are made. These investments are providing our team the resources to drive strong sales performance by serving our customers better. We continue to focus on building the basics of great customer service at each store. We’re leveraging the increased parts availability that we continue to add and the addition of key brands that we made over the past year. We are focusing on quick and consistent delivery to our garage customers and building a foundation of knowledgeable team members who understand our commercial customers’ needs and are focused on serving them better than anyone else. We’re measuring our progress and improving customer service through our customer attraction stores which I’ll discuss in a few minutes. Finally, we’re continuing to revolutionalize our commercial sales force. We’re building our team with additional talent to supplement our strong existing talent base. We’ve added several new commercial sales leaders during the first quarter who have management experience with best in class sales and distribution companies and are customer focused with exceptional leadership and team building skills. We continue to expand our sales force of commercial account managers by selectly adding new positions where it’s clear we need more sales coverage to reach the many customer option needs that exist. We’re also providing them more tools that help us acquire new customers and increase our share of our existing customers’ purchases. A milestone in that regard, in regard to tools to make our more effective is the successful implementation of the companywide customer relationship management system during the first quarter. I’d also like to recognize the Auto Part International team for another strong 10.6% comp store sales increase this quarter. AI continues to expand its business rapidly with the successful entry in to the Baltimore Washington markets. We’re also continuing to grow our sales between AI and Advanced store as the two companies are leveraging each others parts availability strengths. This quarter we also opened our first AI store in the same building as an existing Advance store. We plan to continue this model allowing us to better meet our customer’s needs by increasing our parts availability while leveraging our occupancy costs by utilizing square footage that had previously not been productive. Turning now to our DIY transformation, the first quarter was a key point for our team with DIY comp sales. Our team delivered a solid 4.4% positive comp after several quarters of negative DIY results. This was a 550 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter. As an indication of the breadth of the improvement, we’re pleased to report that 74% of our stores posted positive DIY comps for the quarter. This combination of solid DIY comps and double digit commercial comps produces a strong growth model. It’s evident that our industry as a while realized better DIY results this quarter as consumers are saving money by maintaining their existing vehicles rather than replacing them. However, the industry data indicates that our team did increase DIY sales at a faster rate than the market during the quarter which we believe is a very positive sign as we look forward. Even with the increased sales that we saw this quarter, our data shows us that we still have a tremendous opportunity in DIY to fulfill the need of the customers who are walking through our doors each day. In our business, almost all customers come to the stores wanting to fill a need or find a solution to their problem. They want to make a purchase. We still have to do a better job through our service and parts availability initiatives of converting those needs to sales. Taking a longer term view of DIY, we’re working hard to transform it in to a sustainable growth engine in any economy. We’re building a capability that’s best in class, that’s understanding, managing and optimizing the experience of our customers. Through our DIY transformation, we’re striving to turn Advance in to a distinctive and differentiated brand. We’ll be honoring the organization with actionable customer insights to build our growth and we’re continuing to use our peer-to-peer partnerships and our new team member systems to achieve more consistent companywide results. Last year we launched an ongoing companywide customer satisfaction survey. With this tool each of our stores knows the rating its DIY and its commercial customers have given the stores for the level of service that they’re receiving. Basically, we’re measuring our success of the number of customers who gave that store a score of nine or 10 on a scale of one to 10 for customer service. We believe these customer traction scores are making our entire company more customer focused and will be a key driver of our growth going forward. As we analyze our customer traction scores, over 70% of our DIY customers are rating us with a nine or a 10. Although there’s room for significant improvement, that score is increasing as we learn from the surveys and the distribution of scores is relatively tight. In regard to commercial and even with five consecutive quarters of double digit comp sales growth, slightly over 60% of our commercial customers are rating us a nine or a 10 and the distribution of scores is broader meaning our customer experience is not as consistent as we want. Although we’re not satisfied with our current commercial customer scores, we’re excited about the huge opportunities that is shown by these numbers. As we continue to make investments in commercial and work hard to better operationalize our value proposition in our stores we’ll differentiate our customer service, our customer churn rate will decrease and our growth will continue. Switching to new store development, in the first quarter we opened 46 stores including 11 by Auto Part International towards the goal of 75 new Advance stores and 30 AI stores in 2009. We also closed nine stores and relocated three. Our total store count at the end of the quarter was 3,405 including 135 AI stores. Mike will share more information about the store closings that are part of the plan we announced during our fourth quarter release as well as the financial impact of those closings. In closing, thanks again to our team for what you’re doing each day as you serve our customer and drive our results. We continue to be pleased with our commercial results and are certainly encouraged by the significant improvement in our DIY results during the first quarter. Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Kevin to review our availability excellence and superior experience strategy. Kevin P. Freeland I’d also like to congratulate the team on a great quarter. I’ll briefly highlight our initiatives to improve our gross profit rate as well as key focus areas and investments that will continue to drive long term value. During the first quarter our gross profit rate increased 133 basis points versus last year. This improvement was primarily due to continued investments in our new pricing capabilities, merchandising capabilities, parts availability and combined with changes to better align team member incentives resulting in better store execution. [Inaudible] the investments we made last year were related to price optimization. We continue to roll out our new price optimization process which is favorably impacted our gross profit rate in first quarter. Our retail price optimization strategy has been implemented across the majority of the front room categories. We have adjusted prices on key items throughout Q1 to be more competitive within our most impactful categories. The optimization of these categories contributed to our gross profit rate increase during the first quarter. In Q4 we announced a significant change in how we manage the end of life inventory cycle. In the past we devoted our return privileges for parts for early model cars with greater than a five year supply. In an effort to significantly improve the inventory productivity, we have discontinued replenishment on all early model parts with two to four years of supply and have tightened our policy of obsolesce to greater than four years of supply. This policy change enables us to free up shelf space in our stores to ensure the right parts are in stock. During the quarter approximately $6.5 million of slow moving inventory was disposed of and our goal is approximately $18 to $20 million by the end of second quarter. This will not have any impact on our 2009 financials since the inventory adjustment that was made during the fourth quarter of 2008. As we optimize our assortments in parts through our new custom mix process and in the front room business we are identifying both overstocks of basic inventory as well as identifying unproductive inventory. We are working aggressively to remove this product from our store assortments in 2009 utilizing both markdown strategies and our vendor return privileges. Another initiative we have underway is the implementation of our core merchandising system. I am pleased with our progress thus far. We are currently on track for our initial implementation which begins in the second half of 2009 and will be completed in early 2010. As previously stated, we anticipate that we will begin to realize the benefits of the new system and begin to see improved category performance as the result of the new capability investments. We are also moving to develop a true direct importing program and believe our opportunities in this area are great. We opened our Asia sourcing operation and the hiring of our team members is nearly complete. We expect our global sourcing operation will provide significant margin improvements and allow us to increase the speed to market with products that are more focused on what our customers want and need. We are also leveraging the success and experience of Auto Part International. We are working to increase our synergy with AI, to leverage their experience in sourcing they have developed over the last 15 to 20 years. We believe these synergies will prove to be a competitive advantage for us. Now, I’d like to update on the progress of our availability excellence and superior experience strategies. Availability excellence enables us to serve our customers better than anyone else by redefining the standard with breadth, depth and speed of delivery of parts. During the quarter we added to two PDQs or parts delivered quickly and 31 local area warehouses along with increased store delivery services to provide a wider assortment of parts same day for our customers. These facilities combined with the added delivery service should increase our availability to provide parts to our stores within a two hour window. In concert with our new custom mix capability and a record setting 309 inventory upgrades in the quarter, we are setting the standard for availability in our industry. In addition to the investments we also continue to identify opportunities to drive efficiencies. During the quarter we implemented engineered standards for older selection within three of our eight distribution centers. This initiative enables us to improve later productivity in our main distribution centers and reduce distribution expenses over time. Labor performance is steadily increasing consistent with our expectations. Turning to information technology, we are investing in IT in support of our business strategy. In conjunction with the shutdown of the PartsAmerica.com site in February, we launched an online catalog site and begin to build a team of experienced eCommerce professionals. Our goal is to launch a world class eCommerce site in the near future that will support our multichannel strategy and serve our customers better than anyone else. During the quarter, after careful research and consideration we decided to outsource the company’s corporate purchasing and expense account payables function to IBM, a nationally recognized provider of source to pay services. This change only impacts the purchases of goods not for resale. By outsourcing these areas we’ll be able to focus resources on achieving our key strategies, provide savings opportunities by leveraging IBM’s buying power during vendor negotiations, gain access to IBM’s global expertise and best practices for both sourcing and expense accounts payable and improve processes and organizational capabilities with both procurement and account payable policies. This transition will be complete in the fourth quarter. Advance will continue to internally manage the purchase and payment of all merchandise sold in our stores. Our superior experience strategy enables us to serve our customers better than anyone else by consistently providing legendary customer service through a relentless focus on execution. Superior experience translates that goal in to the specific activities that our team members must perform in order to unlock their full potential, drive significant customer satisfaction improvement while ultimately accelerating sales growth. During the first quarter we began an initiative designed to introduce new strategies and operating changes in to the stores in a scalable and repeatable method that ensures consistent and sustained operating performance. This new implementation factory will launch several key programs that will be rolled out in Q2 and Q3. In closing, I continue to be encouraged with the progress we are making as a result of our investments in availability excellence and superior experience. In the future, I look forward to sharing the benefits of these initiatives as a result of the investments that we’re making. Now, let me turn the call over to Mike to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona I would like to start by personally thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for the results we achieved this quarter. What is impressive is despite being in the early stages of our turnaround, our team members continued to find ways to take care of customers, lead change and deliver strong financial results. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights of our 2009 first quarter; two, share the specific investments that are driving our sales and profit gains and how they are impacting our cost structure; and three, share what we see for the balance of the year. Turning to our first quarter, our results include a change in accounting principle for freight and other handling costs associated with transferring merchandising from [inaudible] and PDQs to our retail stores from recording such costs as SG&A to recording those costs in gross profit. This change which has no impact to operating income or cash flows more accurately reflects the nature of the expense. It also makes our results more comparable to our competitors. Going forward our results will be reported under this new accounting principal and we have retrospectively adjusted all prior periods related to cost of sales and SG&A. The impact for the first quarter of 2009 was a reclass of 112 basis points out of SG&A and in to gross profit. Our results also include $0.04 per diluted share of expenses related to our incremental store divestiture plan previously announced in our 2008 fourth quarter release. Currently we estimate that the full year incremental store divestiture will result in a $0.15 to $0.22 charge to EPS with the majority of expenses occurring during the second and third quarters. As previously stated these costs are not included in our 2009 annual outlook. Our first quarter financial results significantly exceeded our expectations driven by an 8.2% comp store sales increase combined with a strong gross profit rate improvement versus prior year as a result of our continued investments. Our earnings per diluted share of $0.98 included a $0.04 charge related to store divestitures which as previously shared was not part of our 2009 annual outlook. Excluding the impact of the store divestitures, our earnings per share of $1.02 increased 19% on top of a 21% increase in EPS last year. Some highlights for the first quarter include an 8.2% comp store sales increase comprised of a 17.5% increase in commercial and a 4.4% increase in DIY. Please note that the impact of the calendar shift as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal year 2008 added approximately 1% to our total comp store sales in Q1. The impact of the calendar shift will reverse and be a headwind to our comp store sales during the back half of 2009. Our commercial comp was comprised of an 18.3% increase in Advance stores and a 10.6% increase from Auto Part International. On the DIY side we delivered a 5.5% sequential improvement from Q4 driven by a higher customer average and increase traffic as measured by transactions. Quite frankly, we did not anticipate this dramatic increase with every area in our company posting positive DIY comp sales. All in, our revenue grew at 10.3% versus the remainder of the total market growth of 4%. Clearly, our strong top line experience exceeded expectations and resulted in significant market share gains. During the first quarter our gross profit rate increased 133 basis points versus last year primarily due to more effective pricing and better store execution. We are beginning to realize the benefits from the investments we have made over the past year and during the quarter in terms of both our pricing and merchandising capabilities. These capabilities are allowing us to be more targeted with respect to our commercial and retail pricing strategies and better positioned from a cost standpoint. Additionally, our stores team members have responded remarkably to our new incentive structure. We are very pleased with our margin improvements. Our SG&A rate increased 142 basis points and was driven by higher incentive compensation, store divestiture expenses and continued strategic capability investments to improve the company’s gross profit rate and accelerate the commercial business. The higher incentive compensation and store divestiture expenses drove over 100 basis points of the increase during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by occupancy and advertising expense leverage as a result of the company’s 8.2% comparable stores sales increase. Despite the SG&A increase our operating margin increased 25 basis points during the first quarter after removing the impact of the incremental store divestitures. We previously shared that 2009 would be another year marked by investments required as part of our turn around and this played out in our first quarter SG&A line. I will share more on our SG&A investments later in my remarks. Free cash flow for the quarter was $201.4 million or a 34% increase over prior year’s first quarter primarily driven by an increase in net income, a decrease in owned inventory and the timing of tax payments. With this free cash flow we paid down $176.1 million of debt during the quarter. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio increased to 59.8% from 57.2% at year end 2008 and from 58.6% at the end of first quarter last year. Inventory only grew 3.9% from last year’s first quarter compared to sales growth of 10.3%. Our rent adjusted leverage ratio at the end of first quarter was 2.4 times which was in line with our internal target. From a capital structure perspective, we are managing the business to a maximum adjusted debt to EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.5 times with capitalized rent of 6 times. We think this is prudent given the environment and we are comfortable that we can continue to invest in our growth strategies to reach our full potential while also balancing the interest of debt and equity stakeholders. To put our first quarter results in to perspective, we are pleased with our fifth consecutive double digit commercial comp sales growth, our first positive DIY comp in 12 quarters and the gross profit rate improvement which all result in strong earnings growth. We are also happy with the free cash flow we generated and the fact that we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Naturally, SG&A growth is not what we are striving for longer term but it is not a surprise given our investment priorities and our terrific first quarter results. Now, I’d like to share with you the specific investments we are making to improve our operating performance in the future and how they are impacting our SG&A per store performance gage. During Q1 our comparable SG&A per store increased to $607,000 per store from $509,000 per store in the fourth quarter. The increase in SG&A per store can be placed in to three buckets. First, key investments we made last year and continue to make that we are beginning to see benefits from. Examples include inventory upgrades, commercial resource investments, price effectiveness and physical inventories all of which impacted our improved commercial comps and margin improvements this quarter. Secondly, investments we have recently made that have been dilutive due to the timing and pay back horizon of the investment. Examples include our merchandising system, fleet outsourcing, goods not for resale outsourcing, global sourcing, engineered standards, building commercial sales force, recently investments in PDQs and [logs] and store divestitures. All of these investments will have strong financial returns yet were dilutive this quarter. Lastly, investments we made in the current quarter that delivered an immediate financial return. There is no better example of this than the structural change we made to our incentive system to pay on growth rather than budget. In times of growth like we experienced in our first quarter, our bonus expense will be linear especially when you are transforming from a capped program. However, our teams now have unlimited up sight to accelerate growth. These are examples of why we have said 2009 will resemble last year in terms of our investment profile and pace and also why we are seeing deleverage in our SG&A. Spending always comes ahead of returns and we are simply playing catch up in terms of some of the key capabilities and investments needed to transform and differentiate our business. This will have a tendency to frustrate those who look at our SG&A on a shorter term horizon. However, our solid first quarter results including our strong commercial comp, improved margin rate improvement and DIY share gain provide direct evidence that the investments we started last year were in the right areas even though those investments burdened our SG&A last year. As we peer through the lens of our four strategies we also believe our current performance is only a mile marker to what we believe is our full potential. We believe our four gages continue to be the right barometers to measure our performance but naturally they will not move in tandem. We have prioritized growth in returns to be leading indicators as measured by sales per square foot and ROIC. SG&A per store will be more of a lagging indicator given the timing of benefits. Looking ahead, I would like to remind you that the stimulus checks during our second quarter last year benefitted our top line approximately 2%. That said, we are optimistic in our growth and profitability profile based on our Q1 results and we remain committed to the strategic objectives and investment profile we shared with you last quarter. Additionally, we will increase our investment spending in key strategic areas including commercial trucks, part pros and drivers as well as areas such as global sourcing and eCommerce. Our proven results coupled with our low market share demand that we move even faster. With these changes we now expect each 1% increase in comparable store sales will add approximately $0.05 EPS on an annual basis. Our previously shared 10 basis points improvement sensitivity in operating margin is still expected to add approximately $0.03 of EPS. These sensitivities do not include our store divestiture costs. In closing, we are pleased with the financial results we delivered this quarter. They contain clues that we are on the right pathway to reach our full potential and are also a reminder that we are still in the investment cycle of our turnaround. We remain cautiously optimistic about the economic environment and the impact it is having on our valued customers. Most importantly, we are proud of our dedicated team members who delivered fantastic first quarter results and who are passionately leading our turnaround. We are now ready for questions."

Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 50,000 Team Members for their hard work in getting us off to a great start in 2010. The team has positioned us for another great year, both on the top line and the bottom line through a commitment of superior service in simply everyday heroics. The combination of strong market conditions and successful execution of our key initiatives drove an 8.7% increase in total sales and a two-year comp store sales of 15.9%. We also expanded our gross profit rate by 93 basis points, and we generated double-digit operating income growth during the quarter. I am encouraged by our continued improvement and our overall customer satisfaction scores, while recording a record level 15.9% return on invested capital. Collectively, the strategic and financial progress is evident in our customer experience, bottom line results and our new investment grade rating. As you recall, fourth quarter demand and sales had moderated, causing our financial results to be below expectations. This was due in part to our strategic investments. However, our assumption was that these investments would help position us for a strong start to 2010, and they did. Our first quarter 2010 was one where we outperformed both our financial and strategic objectives. We are realistic that three quarters of the year is ahead of us. So we remain focused on our commitment to drive material outcomes with a select group of high-impact operating initiatives. Today, we are pleased with the progress of those initiatives, including the rollout of our new Commercial programs, which is now in roughly 50% of our stores and the success of our customer-oriented sales training. We continue to make progress on our demand-driven labor model, and we work to continually improve our order accuracy. Our global sourcing capability has ramped up, and we continue to strengthen our marketing program. Jim, Kevin and Mike will provide updates on some of these initiatives later in the call. We are off to a good start in the second quarter. We continue to see positive trends in our industry, with the strengthening of our Commercial customers as a result of dealer closing. Additionally, increases in both the average age of vehicles and in miles driven aid the trends. These positive signs in our industry, combined with our sharper focus on fewer priorities, lead us to be upbeat about our outlook for 2010 and beyond. At Advance, our goal is to a have leading customer experience in our industry and to create customers for life. We will get this done with great values, great team and great character. Here is an example of what great looks like. I would like to recognize District Manager Gary Cox for his role in leading our company. In mid-2009, Gary assumed responsibility for a very challenging market in Texas. Gary's unlimited optimism and coaching his team turned around the market from negative double-digit comps early on, to generating positive double-digit comps by the end of the year. Through execution of our improved sales and distribution processes, Gary's district saw an increase of almost 10% in overall transactions and an additional 8% increase in average ticket. Gary was recognized as the District Manager of the Year in 2009 and maintained top scores for team engagement and customer satisfaction. With Gary, it is all about his team, his peers and the values of Advance Auto Parts. Thank you, Gary, for leading by example. We have a focused agenda to accelerate our growth and profitability. And we remain committed to our four key strategies: Commercial Acceleration, DIY Transformation, Availability Excellence and Superior Experience. I am encouraged with our strong start to 2010, and we are on pace for another successful year. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to provide a progress update on our Commercial and DIY business, along with Store Operations. Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I want to congratulate our entire team for a great start to the year. I will review our sales growth and provide an update on our Commercial and DIY strategies. Our total comp sales grew by 7.7% in the first quarter compared to 8.2% during the same quarter last year. That was our strongest two-year comp performance in recent history. Our 7.7% comp increase was driven by both an increase in our customer average and in our transaction counts. As Darren mentioned, we saw a sequential improvement in the performance of the total market from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010. Our business benefited from these, and our teams responded well by focusing on providing great customer service to every customer who visited or called us. As a result of our Team Members, each of our three geographic areas generated strong positive comps in DIY and double-digit comps in Commercial, which marks our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit Commercial comps in our Advance Auto Parts stores. Commercial now represents 33% of our total sales, moving us closer to our goal of 50% over time and truly becoming a more fully integrated service model. With our accelerated growth, we continue to gain significant market share in Commercial during the quarter, but we have a long runway ahead of us, with less than 5% market share in the $40 billion commercial market. On our last conference call, we reviewed our Commercial initiatives and our key focuses for 2010. I want to give you a quick update on the status of those initiatives. Our Commercial initiative is focused on what our customers tell us as most important to them: Have the part I need and deliver to me quickly and accurately every time. We have now completed investments in additional Parts Pro's trucks and drivers and approximately 1/2 of our stores with Commercial programs. These stores continue to produce comp sales increase that's significantly higher than our double-digit company average. These investments will continue to fuel our growth in 2010 as we look towards extending those investments to the entire chain over time. Also as we continue to learn more about the potential of each store in each markets, we're investing in high-performing stores in 2010 by reallocating previous investments where we see the opportunity to increase productivity. Our investments in parts availability are continuing, and Kevin will update you on our progress. As I visit our stores, our teams are thrilled with our increasing ability to get the right parts in each store based on the specific vehicles and their markets. This availability continues to be a fundamental driver of our Commercial growth. Raising the overall operational consistency of service to our commercial customers is also a key focus in 2010. We believe this is key to increasing the retention of our existing customers, while expanding our customer base. Another step in this direction is our new online ordering system, which Kevin will update you on. After increasing our Commercial sales force by 45% in 2009, we are focused on 2010 on increasing the productivity of our sales force by developing deeper relationships with our existing customers and developing relationships with our potential new customers. The combination of our dedicated sales force visiting our customers and our store teams providing consistently great service is a strong driver of growth. In addition to strong sales growth, we are very pleased that our Commercial customer satisfaction scores have continued to increase in 2010 over significant increases last year. Hopefully, how our customers feel about our service is the best predictor of our future growth. Our focus in 2010 is on those stores where our customers have given us our lowest customer satisfaction ratings. As we build our strong Commercial brand, we expect every store to provide exceptional service consistently. As we said in our last call, we continue to believe we have the potential to grow this business in double digits for the 2010 year. Now turning to DIY, we felt a strong growth in our DIY business and achieved our fourth quarter of positive DIY comps in the last five quarters. We believe our strong DIY results were driven by the success of our initiatives, as well as our stronger overall DIY market. We believe the cold and snowy winter, deferred maintenance and an overall increase in consumer spending factored in to our first quarter DIY results as well. As I did with Commercial, I want to give you a quick update on our DIY initiatives and what we're focused in 2010. Our DIY initiatives focused on what our customers tells us as most important: Friendly and knowledgeable people that can solve my problem, are available when I need them and have the part I need when I need it. The parts availability initiatives I described in regard to Commercial apply equally with DIY. We'll continue to increase our availability in 2010. To ensure our customers have Team Members available when needed, we're improving the staffing of our stores based on a demand-driven model. The upgrades in our staffing effectiveness will continue to be rolled out during the year and are being enthusiastically embraced by our store teams. We have increased the quality and effectiveness of our training and development programs for our Team Members. This includes our onboarding program for new hires, General Manager development, product knowledge and related problem-solving skills and basic customer greeting and sales skills for all of our Team Members. This is a key focus across our company in 2010 and is critical to us meeting the needs of our customers. The launch of our new B2C website last fall is now providing us additional DIY sales. But probably, more importantly, many customers are visiting our site before making the decision to visit a store to make a purchase. The lack of an E-commerce presence, combined with decreased new store openings and increased store closures last year, contributed to our inconsistent growth relative to the overall market. We believe E-commerce will be a strong sales driver for us in the future. During our fourth quarter conference call, we discussed our marketing strategies to increase the number of customers who come to our stores. We continue to refine our approach to better target both our highest potential customers and our underserved customer segment. This new more targeted approach has allowed us to more than double our marketing effectiveness, while keeping our overall marketing spend roughly in line with last year. Our primary sponsorship with Monster Jam, which we announced in the fourth quarter, is now in full swing. It is being received well by our customers as well as our Team Members. We're very pleased with the returns and progress of our marketing initiatives. Our customer satisfaction ratings for our DIY customers also continued at a high level. With these scores and with the initiatives that we're focused on, we're excited about our ability to grow our DIY business, while continuing to aggressively grow our Commercial business. Wrapping up with new store growth, during the first quarter, we opened 43 stores, including 11 Autopart International stores, while closing one store. As of the end of the first quarter, our total store count was 3,462, including 167 Autopart International stores. I want to wrap up by just again thanking our team for a great first quarter. Your commitment to leading inspired teams and providing great customer service continues to produce our strong sales and profit growth. We look forward to the remainder of 2010. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, Chief Operating Officer, to review our Availability Excellence strategy. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I would also like to congratulate the team for a strong start to 2010. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our many accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to strengthen our gross profit rate and improve our product availability. During the first quarter, our gross profit rate increased 93 basis points versus first quarter of last year. This increase was on top of 133 basis point increase during the same quarter in 2009. Our first quarter improvement was driven by increases in both front room and back room categories, resulting from the rollout of our custom mix and price optimization strategy, the strengthening of our merchandising capabilities and the impact of our rapidly growing global sourcing capabilities. Through our custom mix rollout, we have upgraded inventories at more than 470 stores during the quarter. This strategy allows us to improve our end-market availability of parts and accessories and drives improvements in both sales lift and margin performance. During the quarter, sales of Hard Parts grew at double-digit rate and increased roughly 100 basis points as a percent of total revenue versus the first quarter of 2009. This increase in sales mix for Hard Parts and improvement in category margin rate was a strong contributor to our 93 basis point expansion in total gross profit rate. Additionally, we continue to grow sales and expand our margins in accessories, which have benefited greatly from our new global sourcing capabilities. In the first quarter, we continue to make significant progress in increasing our availability through the addition of two PDQs or Parts Delivered Quickly warehouses and three HUB stores. The two new PDQs are providing increased service to over 200 stores and brings our total number of PDQs to 29. Additionally, our delivery HUB network is now at 157, providing multiple deliveries per day to over 2,100 stores. Despite the significant investments in PDQs, the associated transportation expense and the increased number of HUBs, our supply chain costs are down versus last year. This is primarily due to our ability to improve our overall supply chain productivity. I'm encouraged that our E-commerce site continues to go so well. Based on our current trend, we believe our E-commerce business will materially contribute to our DIY business in 2010. We launched the test of our new business-to-business site in Q4 and expect a rollout nationally during 2010. Ultimately, our combined E-commerce platform should prove to be a significant growth engine for us in the future. Our adjusted accounts payable inventory ratio of 68.9% is at an all-time high and compares to 59.8% at the end of first quarter last year. This significant achievement was primarily driven by more favorable payment terms and the timing of inventory purchases. We are in pace to achieve our long-term goals and expect to see a continued year-over-year improvement in 2010. In the first quarter, AI's revenue grew 18% driven by strong comp sales performance and the net addition of 32 stores over the past 12 months. AI opened 11 new stores during the quarter, bringing their total store count to 167. We continue to move at a measured pace to expand AI footprint by accelerating new store growth in new markets, namely Florida, and generate synergies through a supply chain integration. Overall, our first quarter was very successful for our team, and I'm thrilled by the strategic and financial progress we've made through our Availability Excellence strategy. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for the strategic progress and fantastic financial results we delivered during the first quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide some financial highlights of our 2010 first quarter performance. Two, provide an update on the key financial dimensions of our transformation. And three, link our first quarter performance to the balance of 2010. Before I comment on our financial results, I would like to point out that, as of this quarter, we will only provide consolidated comparable store sales results versus breaking out DIY and Commercial comp sales. This change in policy better aligns with our focus on growing our four walls of sales by transforming Advance into an integrated service model providing parts and accessories to both DIY and Commercial customers. In addition, this change is consistent with how our industry reports their comparable store sales. I would also remind you that 2009 includes the impact of store divestitures, which decreased diluted EPS by $0.04 during the first quarter last year. I will speak about our year-over-year results versus 2009 on a comparable operating basis, excluding the impact of the 2009 store divestitures, as that provides a more transparent and relevant comparison. We have provided GAAP financials, as well as comparable operating results in our earnings release. Turning to our first quarter. Earnings per diluted share of $1.19 was $0.17 favorable to last year, representing a 17% increase in EPS, excluding the $0.04 impact of store divestitures. This was on top of last year's 19% EPS increase. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $0.21 favorable to last year. Some highlights for the first quarter include a 7.7% comp store sales increase, which was fueled by strong positive comps in DIY and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit gains in Commercial. This was on top of an 8.2% comp during the same period last year, which represented our most challenging quarterly comp store sales comparison. During the first quarter, our gross profit rate increased 93 basis points versus last year, primarily due to continued investments in pricing, merchandising capabilities, parts availability and an increase in direct sourcing. The 93 basis point increase was on top of 133 basis point gross profit rate improvement during the first quarter 2009. Our SG&A rate during the quarter increased 68 basis points, excluding the impact of store divestitures. This 68 basis point increase was driven by the annualization of last year's Commercial investments in over 500 stores, E-commerce and strategic capabilities, such as global sourcing. This was partially offset by a leverage on occupancy expenses as a result of our 7.7% comp store sales increase. Overall, SG&A dollar growth was in line with what we expected and what we communicated on our fourth quarter conference call, after adjusting for the higher variable expenses as a result of the better-than- expected comp store sales growth. On an SG&A-per-store basis, more than 75% of the dollar growth was driven by 2009 expense annualization and by variable expenses, while less than 25% of the growth in SG&A dollars per store was driven by new investments. Free cash flow for the quarter was $262.9 million, which represents a 31% increase over last year. This increase of $61.5 million was primarily driven by improvements in inventory management, a record-high accounts payable ratio of 68.9% and our strong operational performance, which increased net income. As a result of our strong free cash flow, we were able to repurchase approximately 6.9 million shares of our stock, or 7% of our shares outstanding, for $287.7 million at an average share price of $41.62. We now have $212.3 million remaining under our $500 million share repurchase authorization. We have previously stated that we would be opportunistic with share repurchases based on valuation. And given we trade at a surprising 20% EBITDA multiple discount to our peers, we felt the timing is right to repurchase our shares, given our view of the future. We believe in our company's ability to create long- term shareholder value and this repurchase shows our confidence. On April 29, we announced the closing of our $300 million senior unsecured notes offering with a 5.75% coupon due in 2020. This transaction was important for Advance, as it provides us a more stable long- term capital structure that aligns with our growth strategy and allows us to further diversify our debt to stakeholders. With these funds, we plan to fully repay our $200 million term loan set to expire in October 2011 and the $75 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. This will also enable us to increase funding for supply chain financing, as some banks will allocate capacity to supply chain financing to offset the reduction in bank debt. We believe that this will help accelerate our ability to improve our AP ratio over time. This notes offering will result in incremental interest expense given our existing swaps, which we entered into three years ago, do not expire until October 2011. I will quantify this interest impact for 2010 later in my remarks. In April, we were upgraded to investment grade status by Standard & Poor's. This was an important milestone and accomplishment for our company, and we are particularly proud of this upgrade because we believe it is an independent assessment validating our strong operational and financial performance, solid operating cash flows and strong financial metrics. As you know, we have been working diligently to provide the investments necessary to accelerate the growth of Advance, while ensuring we generate solid returns on these investments. We have publicly committed to grow both our top line and bottom line, while strengthening our balance sheet to ensure we have a strong foundation to grow well into the future. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade metrics and managing our rent-adjusted leverage ratio to a maximum 2.5x. At the end of the first quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.2x. As we have previously shared, our strategy is to position the company to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value. These three dimensions will continue to be how we measure the path ahead. And our performance, thus far, shows we are trending in the right direction. Turning to growth, we are pleased with the 4% improvement we have made in sales per square foot on a trailing four-quarter basis through our first quarter 2010. In addition, we continue to lead the industry in sales per store, which has grown to approximately $1.6 million, representing a 4% increase on a comparable trailing four-quarter basis. Turning to profits. We are pleased with the 93 basis point gross profit rate expansion in our first quarter and our 226 basis point increase on a two-year basis. We expect the investments we have made in our capabilities and infrastructure will drive continued operating income expansion through further gross profit expansion and more moderate SG&A dollar growth. Turning to value creation. We are pleased with our 31% increase in free cash flow in our first quarter, an improvement in our balance sheet, driven by effective working capital and inventory management. We continue to demonstrate our ability to generate strong incremental returns on our investments, as evidenced by our ROIC, which, at the end of the first quarter, was 15.9%, representing a 130 basis point increase from last year. Looking ahead, we expect to leverage this strong financial platform we have built, along with our recent upgrade by S&P into a continued growth in economic profit. For the balance of the year, we are on track to open approximately 150 new stores for both Advance and Autopart International brand. And we remain on plan with respect to our investments to grow our Commercial business and to improve our DIY sales performance. We are pleased with the strong start, as the market performed higher than we expected, and our execution was solid. While we are optimistic for the full year, we remain pragmatic and do not anticipate that the two-year trends will continue at this Q1 pace. We remain focused on delivering and executing on our original plans for this year that we shared with you on our fourth quarter call and that were built into our 2010 outlook. During our fourth quarter earnings release, we provided an annual outlook, which included an estimated 2010 operating EPS range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. This annual outlook was based on operating performance only and did not include share repurchases for the impact of the recent notes offering. The favorable impact of our share repurchases, partially offset by the recent notes offering, will add a net incremental benefit of approximately $0.14 to our full year EPS, of which we realized $0.04 in our first quarter results. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start to 2010. As Darren mentioned, we remain committed and focused on our four strategies that are allowing us to build a differentiated service model to serve both our DIY and Commercial customers. We are encouraged by our investment grade status, and we'll be working aggressively to ensure we maximize the benefits associated with these. Again, I would like to thank all of our talented Team Members, who are passionately leading us through our transformation and who have truly helped our company reach new heights. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

The reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at advanceautoparts.com. For planning purposes, our second quarter earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, August 10, 2011, after market close, and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, August 11, 2011. To be notified of the date of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for 1 year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 52,000 team members for their hard work and dedication to serving our customers. We entered this year with a considerable momentum and expected 2011 would be a continuation of a very strong 2010. Our ""Service is our best part"" plan was very ambitious, including the launch of our national advertising campaign, the company-wide rollout of our new district in commercial leadership model and the restart of our wave efforts. We made these decisions and began implementing them in the fourth quarter of last year, anticipating that our momentum and exceptional industry dynamics would position us for a strong first quarter and fiscal 2011. Our momentum and overall performance proved to be different than we expected. We highlighted that during our Q4 conference call in mid-February, the change in momentum and the volatility principally driven by weather. We shared with you that we expected our Q1 comparable sales growth to be flat to up low single digits. Our comparable store sales were 1.4% for the first quarter of 2011. While they were in the range, quite frankly, we expected better top line and bottom line outcomes. That being said, our first quarter demonstrated the great resolve of our team as we achieved record customer satisfaction and team member engagement scores for the quarter. This bodes well for the future. However, our first quarter also highlighted the short-term bumps of accelerating the pace and the breadth of change in pursuit of long- term goals to differentiate ourselves and ultimately win with the customer. The fundamentals of our business continue to be strong, and we benefit from the structural advantages of our industry. Advantages include the average age of vehicles, constrained new car sales and a fragmented commercial market. We continue to see opportunity for us to become a more differentiated, fully integrated service model focusing both on DIY and commercial customers. To that end, our first quarter reinforced to us that our goals and objectives are the right ones to lead and service and to provide our customers with superior availability. Simply said, we are committed to providing our team the tools necessary to increase productivity and engagement, which will allow them to serve our customers better than anyone else. We will continue our efforts to provide the products and services necessary to help our customers succeed. However, our slow start to the year has caused us to step back and examine our current business environment, which has been quite volatile. For sure, our prior year sales comparisons are challenging. The weather has not cooperated and the sharp rise in fuel prices will cause challenges to both the consumer and business. We have adapted our plans to this changing context. However, our strategic and financial commitments have remained the same for 2011. These commitments include delivering our earnings outlook for the year of $4.60 to $4.80 per share and improving our customer satisfaction and our team member engagement. Our path to those outcomes will flex though. Through the balance of the year, we will be making appropriate adjustments to the pace of change, initiatives and cost structure aimed at making us a more efficient while delivering our service promise. Ultimately, we will continue on the path to greater service levels and profitability over the foreseeable future. Mike will discuss these changes later in the call. Our service leadership and superior availability strategies will continue to guide and prioritize our focus for the balance of 2011 and beyond. The principal initiatives driving our margin improvements, sales growth and service level improvements will sound familiar. We will continue to invest and focus on commercial, resulting in double-digit comp sales, which is our Q2 trend right now. We will elevate our service and foundational excellence as a top priority to improve our in-store service and execution, resulting in higher customer satisfaction and productivity. We will continue to increase our availability and expand our product offerings and profitability. We will continue to communicate ""Service is our best part"" promise but at a more targeted and cost-effective medium to reignite our DIY growth. And finally, we will ensure the appropriate pacing of initiatives that minimizes disruptions to our field and our customers. Before I close, I want to provide a real-life example of a leader in our company who embodies ""Service is our best part."" Her store was one of our early commercial wave stores, which 2 years ago received more parts pros, trucks, inventory and support from our national sales force. Two years later, General Manager Natasha Carter and her team, score in the top deciles for customer satisfaction and team member engagement. Natasha was provided with the resources we believe necessary for us to win, and Natasha is leveraging those resources to their fullest. She is serving our customers better than anyone else, inspiring her team and helping them succeed and grow our business profitably and with integrity. Thanks, Natasha, for bringing ""Service is our best part"" to life and for delighting our customers with dependable and fast service every job, every day. In closing, I speak for Advance in saying we are never satisfied when we miss our expectations. However, we are confident in our team and our business. We remain focused on delivering our goals, including our full-year earnings outlook. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to discuss our service leadership strategy. Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. As always, I want to start by thanking our team as we accelerate our journey to service leadership in the first quarter. During a quarter where business was not where we want it to be, our customer satisfaction measures increased again over last year in both our DIY and Commercial business, which we believe is a very positive sign as we look to the future. We also take full ownership for the results we achieved in the first quarter. And I know I speak for our entire team when I say we're fully committed to achieve the expectations Mike has outlined for the remainder of the year. I will review with you our primary focus areas during the first quarter and how we're approaching the remainder of the year to drive our sales and our profit. Our total comp store sales grew by 1.4% in the first quarter compared to 7.7% during the same quarter last year. This was lower than our expectations in both DIY and Commercial, although Commercial continued to comp strongly relative to the market and was just shy of double digits. Commercial represented 36.6% of our total sales in the first quarter. All of our operating areas were under our internal expectations as a result of both impacts of unseasonable weather in certain geographic regions, such as the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and the impact of the pace and breadth of change. In the first quarter, we accelerate our commitment to carry out our ""Service is our best part"" promise through service leadership. The core of this focus is on several key areas that will better enable every Advance team member to serve our customers with dependable and fast service consistently in every store every day. We believe that to provide a great customer experience, we must achieve a new standard operational and service excellence, and that has to be brought to life for the customer by our store teams. We made good progress on each of these key focuses in the first quarter. We increased the number of district leaders, which reduced the number of stores they lead in order to allow them to spend more time in their stores, coaching and developing their teams. The changes in districts and the related realignment of our sales force created some disruptions as the district leaders and sales force transition to different stores and customers. During the last few weeks, we've been focusing the team so they can be in our stores full-time as we head into the busiest season of our year. Our work to achieve a greater level of consistent foundational excellence in every store has been rolled out across the company. With greater clarity on the team member behaviors that are most important to our customers and the ability of each General Manager to measure their progress, we believe our customers will see our service levels and our consistency continue to rise. As we've discussed for the last few quarters, we continue to build on our customer-driven staffing model to ensure we have the right people at the right time to align with customer traffic. These tools provide our team greater visibility to where our greatest opportunity is for staffing, quantity and quality improvements exist. It's also enabled us to create more flexibility in opening and closing hours and in staffing core positions based on sales volume. For the last couple years, we've significantly advanced our tools for accelerated training and development in both parts knowledge and selling skills to better enable our team to find solutions for their customers. This year, we've added more advanced courses based on skill levels of individual team members to further deepen those skills. As in most businesses, a relatively small number of commercial customers make up a significant part of our sales volume. We continue to be focused on building stronger relationships with our highest potential commercial customers through the partnership of our store teams and sales force to visit and support those customers. Commercial garages is always right timely deliveries [ph] is the most important attribute they expect from their parts supplier. We can now measure our delivery times and order actually to our commercial customers to ensure we're meeting and exceeding their expectations. Lastly, we are working to leverage to its fullest potential the record availability of parts that Kevin will describe along with all the tools his team is providing so we can find the part and get it to the customer fast. We believe these priorities focus on the fundamentals of what our DIY and Commercial customers expect from us. Our core part of our ""Service is our best part"" promise is to continue to raise service levels to our customers, while making our store model more efficient. Our team is excited about the opportunities we're identifying to leverage our expenses and our investments and look forward to delivering on both parts of our promise. In regard to new store openings, during the first quarter, we opened 37 stores, including 9 Autopart International stores. As of the end of our first quarter, our total store count was 3,600, including 203 Autopart International stores. In closing, thanks again to our team as we take the steps to have another successful year by inspiring our teams and serving our customers through our ""Service is our best part"" promise. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss our superior availability strategy. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their hard work in the first quarter. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy. During the first quarter, our gross profit rate increased 73 basis points versus the first quarter of 2010 and has increased 298 basis points in the past 3 years. The first quarter improvement was driven by increases in both front room and back room categories resulting from the rollout of our custom mix and price optimization strategies, the strengthening of our category management capabilities and the impact of our rapidly growing global sourcing capabilities. We saw strong increase in shipments versus Q1 of 2010. Through the balance of the year, our gross margins will be much more constrained, driven by fuel prices, supply chain investments, high commodity inflation and an economic landscape that continues to put pressure on our customers, which ultimately limits our ability to fully pass through the product cost increases. We completed nearly 400 inventory upgrades during the quarter, including upgrades of 60 new HUB stores. As a frame of reference, we operated approximately 85 delivery HUB stores 3 years ago versus nearly 240 today. This pace of investment substantially improves our competitive position on same-day part availability. Combined with a significant increase in overall inventory, we ended the quarter with the highest inventory per store and set company records for in-stocks, parts coverage and the customer perception of availability. Our adjusted accounts payable inventory ratio increased to 74.3% at the end of first quarter from 68.9% at the end of first quarter 2010. The increase in our AP ratio continues to be driven by more favorable payment terms, supply chain financing and the timing of inventory purchases. Our owned inventory was essentially flat despite a 21% increase in total inventory from Q1 2010. Supply chain leverage stalled in the quarter primarily driven by the heavy inventory buildup, DC inefficiencies as we approach maximum DC capacity, higher fuel costs and supply chain investments. Both the inventory buildup and overcapacity will abate in the quarters ahead, but the fuel costs are anticipated to remain above last year comparisons, and the costs associated with our supply chain investments will increase throughout the year. It is expected the supply chain costs will remain a headwind to gross profit for the balance of the year. We continue to be pleased with our E-commerce platform. We saw a significant increase above Q1 last year on our DIY side. That's on top of a very successful performance last year. All metrics continue to improve, including our product assortment, number of site visits and our closed rate driven by site enhancements. Our commercial site launch last quarter continues to grow rapidly as well. Sales increased substantially from one quarter to the next, setting new weekly highs throughout the quarter. After a year of careful research, we launched our ""Service is our best part"" ad campaign in the quarter with a unified message to both DIY and Commercial consumer groups in multiple languages and across all marketing channels, including TV, radio, direct marketing and in-store signage. We'll update you on this effort in the quarters ahead. I'm pleased with the strategic progress our team has made as we continue to focus on providing superior availability. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their contributions to evolving our service model during our first quarter of 2011. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: One, provide some financial highlights from our 2011 first quarter; two, put our first quarter results into context with both our expectations and key financial dimensions that we are using to measure our performance; and three, share with you the actions we are taking to deliver our annual financial outlook for 2011. Our revenue increased 3.7% driven by 138 net new stores over the past 12 months and a comparable store sales increase of 1.4% during the first quarter. This was on top of a 7.7% comp sales increase last year, representing a 9.1% 2-year comp store sales increase. While we continued to see strong performance in Commercial, which was just shy of achieving double-digit comp store sales growth, our first quarter comp sales were below our expectations. I will provide further insights on the actions we are taking later in my remarks. As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate increased 73 basis points versus 2010 and continues to be driven by improved merchandising and pricing capabilities and improved parts availability, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. The 73-basis point increase was on top of a 93-basis point gross profit rate improvement during the first quarter of 2010. We continue to expand our margins while maintaining a strong competitive pricing position, as well as mitigating the impacts of the mix pressure of the strong growth of our Commercial business, which has a lower gross profit rate. Our commercial mix represented 36.6% of our 2011 sales versus 33.4% in 2010. While we exceeded our internal expectations for gross profit rate improvement, our gross profit rate will be constrained for the balance of the year as Kevin previously shared. Our SG&A rate of 40.7% increased 88 basis points versus the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to increased advertising spend, store labor and fixed cost deleverage due to the modest comparable store sales increase, partially offset by lower incentive compensation compared to last year. All in, our operating income grew 2.1% and our OI rate decreased 15 basis points to 9.8%, primarily driven by our sales shortfall. However, our diluted earnings per share increased 13.4% to $1.35 versus $1.19 last year. This increase was primarily driven by our share repurchase activity over the past year. Free cash flow through the first quarter was $152.9 million versus $262.9 million last year. This decrease in free cash flow was driven by the change in owned inventory this year versus first quarter 2010 and a higher capital expenditures. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio increased to 74.3% as of the first quarter of 2011, from 68.9% over the same period last year as part of our continued efforts to reduce our net owned inventory. During our first quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of our stock for $270 million at an average price of $63.72 per share. Our earnings release for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 reported 1.9 million of these shares that had been repurchased between January 2, 2011, and the earnings release on February 9, 2011. Through the end of our first quarter, we had approximately $352 million remaining on our existing share buyback authorization. These repurchases reflect our view of our valuation and our internal confidence in our company's ability to grow profitably and to create long-term shareholder value. During the first quarter, we made progress with our customer satisfaction and team member engagement scores, which we view as leading indicators of future performance. That said, our first quarter operating and financial performance fell below our expectations. With our strong 2010 fourth quarter, where we accelerated market share growth and customer satisfaction scores and with our sequential and accelerating financial and operating performance over the past 3 years, we expected to build on that momentum in the first quarter. We did share with you on our fourth quarter earnings call that we had gotten off to a slower start. While our comp sales increase came in the range we shared with you on our fourth quarter conference call, they were below our internal expectations we set at the beginning of the year. We know some external factors outside our control had some impact such as weather in our markets, gas prices and slower industry growth than last year. We also know things directly in our control played a role in our underperformance. These include minimizing the short-term impacts of structural changes needed to deliver on our service promise, better pacing of our initiatives, better leveraging and delivering the benefits from our previous strategic investments and execution. We are confident in our team's ability to execute on these improvements based on our progress over the last 3 years. Looking forward, we continue to believe growth, profit and value are the right holistic financial measures. However, our first quarter results require us to focus in each of these areas to adjust, to ensure we maximize the performance of each measure. Turning to growth. We are pleased with our Commercial growth, but our 5% share in a highly fragmented commercial market demands continued urgency to ensure we continue to make this a primary focus as it is a key driver of continuing to grow our sales per store. We also are closely monitoring the industry growth to ensure we adjust our variable costs in light of our more volatile business environment. Turning to profit. We have previously shared that we see a pathway to 12% operating margins over the next 2 to 3 years. With a large portion of our investments made and key capabilities built, we are placing a larger emphasis on getting to 12% operating margins. We expect to get there through modest gross profit expansion in areas such as global sourcing, availability and supply chain efficiencies. However, the largest contributor to us improving our operating margins will come from our cost structure. We started this work last year and shared on our last earnings call that we expected SG&A dollar growth per store to decelerate in 2011 from 2010. We shared that we expected SG&A per store to grow in the range of 2% to 4% in 2011 from 6.7% in 2010. With our performance in our first quarter, we are adjusting our FY '11 SG&A per store growth to be flat to 2%. To be clear, our work to reduce our cost structure will not take us off course of delivering on our service promise to serve our customers better than anyone else, growing our market share and delivering the expected outcomes we have shared from our service leadership and superior availability strategies. Instead, it will require better balance to the pace of change, initiatives and cost reductions that enable our service promise and make us more efficient. Our cost structure work will be multi-year work in the areas of labor productivity, operational efficiencies, reducing variability and store performance and reductions in costs driven by slower pace of investments and a more competitive support structure. These actions will position us to enable growth and improve our profit model. Turning to shareholder value. We continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital as reflected in our return on invested capital, which is now at 18% or 210 basis points over the first quarter last year and represents a 340-basis point improvement on a 2-year basis. We are also pleased with our 74.3% AP ratio and continue to see opportunities to improve our AP ratio to reduce our owned inventory. We also are focusing on ensuring we are benefiting from our increased inventory per store to meet our customer availability needs and to maximize our cash flow. We are now expecting our comp sales increase to grow in the low single digits for the year. Darren, Jim and Kevin outlined several efforts underway, which are designed to focus our company, reinvigorate our top line performance and continue our strategic progress on delivering our service promise. We also have adjusted our cost structure and pace of strategic initiatives to position us to leverage SG&A at lower comp levels. With the adjustments we have made, we still expect to deliver on our previously communicated annual EPS outlook of $4.60 to $4.80. In closing, while our first quarter was challenging, we are confident in delivering on our annual outlook with the adjustments we are making. We are focused and committed to building an integrated service model to deliver our service promise of ""Service is our best part"" through our service leadership and superior availability strategies. Our improved customer satisfaction scores from our first quarter reinforce we are on the right path. We also are committed to making the necessary adjustments to our operating model that are fiscally prudent, and that will improve our profit model. Our talented team members will continue to propel us forward and ultimately allow us to reach our full potential. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
147,GV_145977_2012Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Director of Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call. Joshua Moore Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements address future events, developments or results and typically use words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, will, plan, forecast, outlook or estimate, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause the results to differ materially, including competitive pressures, demand for the company's products, the economy in general, consumer debt levels, dependence on foreign suppliers, the weather, business interruptions and other factors disclosed in the company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. The reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at advanceautoparts.com. For planning purposes, our second quarter earnings release is scheduled for August 9, 2012, before market open, and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, August 9, 2012. To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 54,000 Team Members for their hard work and congratulate them on their performance during the first quarter. The consistent focus on service leadership and superior availability and our Team Members' commitment to excellence resulted in a good start to 2012. The combination of solid comparable store sales growth and expense management allowed us to grow our operating profits nearly 21% in the quarter and increase our operating income rate by 167 basis points to 11.5%. Mike will provide more specific details on the first quarter financial results later in the call. During the quarter, we continued to grow Commercial through providing customers with both reliable and increased delivery speed, improved availability and through our efforts to increase the strength of our multichannel sales offering, with the rollout of our business-to-business e-commerce platform. During the quarter, we restarted our commercial wave rollout and our growth continues to be fueled by rapid acceleration of our Commercial sales over the last several years. In the first quarter, Commercial made up approximately 38% of our total sales versus 36.6% of our total sales in the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we are pleased with the improved top line and bottom line performance of our commercially focused Autopart International business. AI generated a 6.2% comp store sales increase, while increasing their operating income rate by 246 basis points. Our DIY business continued to improve and positively contributed to our comp store sales growth. We continue to increase the level of service our Team Members provide, better focus our advertising to drive customer traffic and maintain our competitive pricing structure to better compete locally. All in, our comp store sales grew 2.1% for the quarter. Our performance was strong over the first 3 months of the first -- of the fiscal quarter, driven by the increase in categories such as oil, batteries and chemicals despite the high gas prices. The milder winter and early spring weather allowed our customers to get an early start for the spring repair season and perform maintenance on their vehicles much earlier in the year. However, we saw softness in our failure-related categories as cars were more able to endure the mild winter, and as such, the demand for those products was lighter than anticipated. Although we had a very solid quarter in sales, our growth underperformed our expectations as our business significantly slowed in April, partially offsetting our fast start to our year. As we start our second quarter, we continue to see the softness that we witnessed in April. However, we believe this slowdown is temporary and does not overshadow the strong structural elements of our industry, including the roughly 240 million vehicles on the road and the average age approaching 11 years. We believe these factors will continue to be major drivers of the long-term growth and the stability of our industry. Gas prices have decreased from their previous highs earlier in the year, and we are optimistic that the pace of our business will accelerate as gas prices decline. As such, we will remain committed to our priorities for the year and the pace in which we execute each initiative. As a reminder, those priorities include improving our in-market availability through the continued expansion of our hub network; the opening of our new DC during the back half of the year; our continued efforts to enhance our e-commerce offerings and to increase the penetration of our B2B e-commerce platform for our commercial customers; focused training for our field teams in the areas such as service leadership, inventory management and commercial execution; and finally, continued rollout of our commercial wave programs and the completion of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit to strengthen our competitive footing within the commercial market. Mike will provide more specifics regarding the full year outlook in a moment. A few weeks ago, I was thrilled to visit with all of our general managers and field leaders from around the country during our Annual Leaders Forum. I walked away with countless examples of how service leadership is being ignited across our company and it was truly inspiring to see the energy and enthusiasm from all of our leaders. I'd like to close with an example of how one leader is bringing services our best part to life in the field. Mike Byrd had joined Advance 23 years ago as a part-time salesman and has continually excelled with the company, serving as Regional Vice President for the past 5 years. He is a very focused leader, spending a tremendous amount of time side-by-side with his district leaders. He does a fantastic job coaching his teams on ways to better serve our customers. Mike fully understands that our team is in our stores first and foremost to serve our customers. Mike is very engaged and connects very easily with our store teams, but he also sets a very high set of expectations for the team. The recent financial and strategic results that his teams have posted in a very competitive market, including top customer satisfaction scores and high marks, both in team member retention and engagement, are truly a testament to Mike's leadership and dedication of his entire leadership team. Mike accepts excellence as the standard of performance and it shows in the outcomes he is driving. Thanks, Mike, and keep driving us towards excellence. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to congratulate the team for a solid first quarter. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on initiatives to support our superior availability strategy and new store growth. As Darren mentioned, we continue to move full speed ahead on our key priorities for the year, which include our work to increase breadth and depth of our in-market product assortment and availability. This objective is carried out through the efforts to increase the number of hubs in the marketplace, as well as providing delivery capabilities from strategically positioned hubs and to continually improve the availability in our non-hub stores through the inventory upgrade process. During the first quarter, we added 23 hubs and our total hub count is now 317 stores. Additionally,  we upgraded the inventory in 155 stores during the quarter. As a direct result of our hub strategy and inventory upgrades, our in-stock levels are up 70 basis points over last year and continued to run at record levels. As a result of increasing sales and better pacing of inventory investments, our inventory levels decreased 0.5% during the first quarter versus first quarter of last year. Additionally, we continue to expand our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which increased roughly 820 basis points versus the first quarter of last year and now stands at 82.5%. This increase in AP ratios allowed us to reduce our own inventory per store by 33.5% with our total owned inventory decreasing $174.2 million or down 32% versus first quarter of last year. Turning to gross profit, our gross profit rate declined 38 basis points to 50.1% versus first quarter of last year, which was in line with our internal expectation. The anticipated decline was driven by a slower pace of inventory growth resulting in higher supply chain costs as a percent of purchases. However, these cost increases were partially offset by efforts to improve the productivity of our labor and DCs and reduce our transportation costs by focusing on markets and routes where we can better leverage our hub delivery costs. Operationally, we continue to improve and employ high standards of inventory management and asset protection. As a result, the negative impact of shrink on our margins last year has abated and had no effect on our margins during the quarter. The improvement in shrink was achieved a couple of quarters earlier than we had anticipated. We continue to make progress on the opening of our Remington, Indiana DC. We remain on pace to begin receiving product during the second quarter and anticipate beginning shipping product in the third quarter. This new DC will serve over 400 stores, including daily delivery to nearly 200 stores. Beside these capabilities, this DC will provide us with much needed capacity, improve our overall supply chain productivity and continue to increase our overall availability. We continue to reach new customers and grow our sales through the successful expansion of our e- commerce capabilities and new store openings. During the first quarter, we opened 22 Advance stores, 3 Autopart International stores and closed 5 Autopart International stores. As of April 21, 2012, the company's total store count was 3,682 including 200 Autopart International stores. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in greater detail. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated Team Members for their contributions to the solid financial outcomes we delivered in our first quarter of 2012. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights for our first quarter of 2012; two, put our first quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2012. For the first quarter, we are pleased with our ability to grow our profitability with EPS increasing 32.6% to $1.79 per share versus $1.35 during the first quarter of last year. Total sales increased 3.1% to nearly $2 billion, driven by a comparable store sales increase of 2.1% during the first quarter and 82 net new stores over the past 12 months. Our comps were primarily driven by continued growth in our Commercial sales, including Autopart International and the increasing contributions by our e-commerce business. As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate in the first quarter was 50.1% versus 50.5% in the first quarter 2011 or a decrease of 38 basis points. This was in line with our expectations. The decrease was primarily due to a much lower pace of inventory growth, which drove higher supply chain costs, partially offset by improvements in supply chain labor and transportation costs. Our SG&A rate of 38.6% decreased 205 basis points versus first quarter of 2011, primarily due to actions we took last year to build a more competitive cost structure, including productivity improvements of our store labor, a planned shift in expenses from Q1 to Q2 and some continued actions to produce our administrative support costs. The planned shift in expenses, which were previously communicated during our fourth quarter conference call, include our annual general managers meeting, advertising and some strategic investments. Our team's improved execution and commitment to grow our business while building a more competitive cost structure resulted in a 20.7% increase in operating income versus first quarter of 2011 to $224.6 million. Our operating income rate increased 167 basis points to 11.5% in the first quarter and 11.3% on a trailing 4 quarters basis. Our EPS increased 32.6% to $1.79 per share. Free cash flow grew to $153.1 million for the quarter, driven by our strong growth in net income and reduced owned inventory. As Kevin mentioned, our reduction in owned inventory was primarily due to our efforts to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which is now at 82.5% versus 74.3% in the first quarter of 2011. At the end of the first quarter, we had $600.6 million of debt on our balance sheet and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.1x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. Our average diluted share count was 74.2 million shares at the end of the quarter. As we have stated in our press release, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program. This new authorization replaces the remaining $200 million of the company's $300 million share repurchase program authorized in August 2011. We remain confident with the solid industry fundamentals, the commercial market opportunity and our ability to profitably grow over time. As we have consistently communicated, we prioritize growth first as our primary use of capital to increase shareholder value, which includes growing our business through our strategic investments and operational performance and looking for future growth opportunities or strategic capabilities that capitalize on the market growth opportunity. While we see growth as our primary focus to increase shareholder value, we will continue to use share buybacks opportunistically, reflecting our confidence in achieving our growth plans. As Darren mentioned, our business softened significantly at the end of the first quarter and we are off to a slow start in Q2. We believe the softness in our business is temporary and we remain confident about our growth prospects, given the continued solid industry dynamics, market opportunity and consumer preference for necessity. Our commitment is unchanged to rolling out our strategic investments at the same pace as we originally planned, which are focused on Commercial, availability, supply chain and e-commerce. We remain relentlessly committed to growing our Commercial Business, given the market opportunity and potential. We have investments aimed at the foundational elements of serving our customers, improving the consistency in which we serve and developing additional capabilities such as B2B platform and the in- sourcing of our commercial credit function. We are pleased with the growth of our Commercial sales per program, which currently is at $643,000, and we continue to be confident in our pathway to achieve our goal of $750,000 per program. We are also pleased with our accelerating B2B e-commerce platform and see much growth ahead. Turning to profit, we are pleased with our continued improvement in our operating income per store and our record trailing 4-quarter operating income rate of 11.3%. Our performance is driven by our team's solid operational performance and actions we took last year to build a more efficient and competitive business that would enable growth and improve our profit model. These actions are allowing us to grow our business while funding the investments in areas, such as Commercial, availability, supply chain and e-commerce and improve our profit model. We are confident that the actions we have taken are the right ones, as we have been able to improve the productivity of our store labor each quarter since the first quarter last year, as well as the consecutive improvements in our DIY sales performance. As a result of our commitment to build a more competitive cost structure while funding our strategic investments, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased 4.3% to $656,000 per store. These actions have enabled us to achieve record profitability and, more importantly, continue to provide us confidence in our pathway to achieve 12% operating margins. As we look at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 20.3%, which increased 230 basis points over the first quarter last year and represents a 440-basis point improvement on a 2-year basis. We are also pleased with our 82.5% AP ratio and continue to see opportunities to improve our AP ratio and reduce our owned inventory. We are focused on ensuring we are benefiting from our increased inventory per store to meet our customer availability needs and to maximize our cash flow. Turning to the balance of the year, we continue to be confident that the fundamentals in our industry are strong. However, we think it's prudent, given the recent softness in our business, to temper our second quarter expectations, and we anticipate that our comp store sales will be flat to negative low-single digits in the second quarter. In addition, the previously communicated planned expense shift from the first quarter to the second quarter will negatively impact our SG&A during the second quarter by roughly $13 million or $0.10 per share. All in, we anticipate a decline in year-over-year operating income dollars during the second quarter. Given these solid industry dynamics, our plan to maintain our investment profile and our operational expectations, we expect our annual comp store sales will grow at low-single digits for 2012. Our gross profit rate is tracking according to our previously communicated outlook and we will make the appropriate adjustments to trend in our business, including adjustments to our variable expenses and maintaining our disciplined focus on managing our administrative and support costs. As a result, we expect that our total SG&A dollars per store will be approximately flat to up 2%. Although we anticipate our profitability during the second quarter will be constrained, we are maintaining our previously communicated 2012 EPS outlook of $5.55 to $5.75 per share. In closing, I would like to thank all of our talented Team Members again for their performance during our first quarter. They made a meaningful impact with their relentless focus on service and operational excellence which were key ingredients to improving our growth, profit and returns in our first quarter. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. To our 54,000 team members, thank you for your hard work and focus on our everyday fundamentals in order to better serve our customers and grow our business. Also, I want to take a moment to welcome George Sherman, our new President, and congratulate Charles Tyson in his recent promotion to EVP, in charge of merchandising, marketing and supply chain. Both George and Charles are with me today and will be available to answer questions during the Q&A portion of this call. Turning to our business. We highlighted during the fourth quarter conference call that our start to the fiscal year would be challenging and demand would continue to be weak for the first quarter. We are not surprised nor are we satisfied with the sales and bottom line results. We continued to experience the temporal impacts to our industry with respect to the unseasonably warm weather in early 2012 that deferred maintenance expenditures and impacted failure rates in vehicles, especially in our cold- weather markets. We expected tougher sales comparisons and the short-term impacts of consumers both considering and increasing big-ticket spending, including new car sales, to factor into our results. Yet, we did not fully anticipate certain impacts to our core customer, including the payroll tax increases, the delayed income tax refunds, coupled with a very slow start to the spring selling season. Collectively, these factors contributed to a much softer than anticipated comparable store sales performance, which declined 3.2%. Our comparable store sales decline was driven by our DIY business and partially offset by a modest gain in our commercial sales. Our decline in transactions was partially offset by an increase in average ticket, which was driven by price optimization and the mix of products sold. The encouraging news is that we expected our sales trends to materially improve in April, and they did. Our best weekly performance during the quarter came in the last 2 weeks, which ended April 20. During that period, we saw both transaction and average ticket growth. The principal driver was a return to a more normal weather pattern in the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions. Specifically, we have seen improvements in our seasonal and maintenance categories as customers began to perform that much- needed work on their vehicles that had been deferred much of last year. This is reaffirming that our market remains strong and consumers still have a willingness to invest in reliable transportation. These positive trends have carried over to the start of our second quarter, generating low-single digit comp store sales increases. However, our optimism continues to be tempered in the face of a solid start to the second quarter. Our last 6 weeks' sales performance have been positive but somewhat uneven week to week, hampered in part due to the sluggish start to the spring selling season. Our seasonal categories like wash and wax, air conditioning and radiators have been the most erratic. Further, our sales outlook for the balance of 2013 remains guarded on account of a couple key macro factors. First is the increase in the number of people purchasing or contemplating the purchase of a new vehicle. Undoubtedly, this will be good for us in the long term. However, it will cause short-term volatility in the industry as customers become more selective in what they invest in maintaining their aging vehicle. Second, our economy continues to be fragile with declining consumer confidence, high unemployment and financial stress on our core customer, which became more acute with the most recent payroll tax increases that took effect at the start of the year. The silver lining is that the economy of necessity, where consumers will continue to seek value from their local aftermarket garages or perform needed repairs and maintenance themselves. Despite our cautious sales outlook, we remain committed to growing our business and profitability through our consistent focus on service leadership and our superior availability strategies. We intend to stay the course in 2013 on our objective of a company of one delivering on the fundamentals. The expected outcome is simple, which is to make the day in terms of our customer experience, sales and profitability. Pragmatically, that means delivering on a few key initiatives, starting with commercial sales and in-store execution, while maximizing the benefits of our investments and availability, delivery speed, e-commerce, diagnostic capabilities and beginning the rollout of our new electronics parts catalog. Collectively, this is consistent with our transition from building capabilities to leveraging them to improve our ability to consistently grow our business and accelerate our profitability. In the first quarter, these efforts are reflected in our improving commercial customer retention and growth rates. Our gross profit rate was essentially flat for the quarter, which was above our expectations. Our SG&A per store was down slightly on a trailing 4-quarter basis versus the first quarter a year ago. All in, and despite our lower-than-anticipated sales performance, this allowed our operating income change in the first quarter to be within our previously-shared outlook of down mid- to upper-single digits, decreasing 9.1%. Mike will share more details of our financial performance later in this call. Now let me provide you an update on our 5 key priorities I outlined at the beginning of 2013. First, growing our Commercial Business through improved levels of delivery speed and reliability and increased customer retention and share of wallet with our national and regional customers. We continue to monitor our ability to deliver fast service safely and accurately, and leverage our investments on our online ordering and the in-sourcing of our commercial credit. Finally, we have begun to invest in sales activation programs to better grow our national and regional customer accounts. As a result of these efforts, we saw positive comp store sales gain in our commercial sales, across-the- board improvements in delivery speed, record B2B and credit penetration, and our mix of business and commercial during the quarter grew to 40.8% versus 37.9% during the first quarter of 2012. Our second priority of improving our local market availability is that we continue to increase the number of hubs in our fleet through the new store openings and the upgrade of existing stores that have that space and are strategically located to operate the hubs. Through our first quarter, we expanded our hub store count to 348, adding 9 hubs during the quarter and 31 since the first quarter of last year. Additionally, we see -- we are seeing progress with our operations at our new Remington DC. As we previously stated, we anticipate ramping up to 400 stores being serviced by Remington this year. Through our first quarter, we had 278 stores receiving shipments from Remington at least once per week, with more than half of those stores receiving daily replenishment. The initial results of our stores receiving daily delivery is promising as they are experiencing a mid-single-digit sales lift versus their control stores within the region, driven principally by the parts category. However, we are still very -- in the very early stages and need to continue to monitor the results over the next several months to draw any definitive conclusions. Our third priority is expanding our new store footprint. As you recall, we completed the acquisition of BWP at the beginning of the fiscal year and began our efforts to integrate the 124 stores we acquired to the Advance Auto Parts platform. We have just completed the integration planning of this work and will begin the process of converting and consolidating stores over the next 12 to 15 months. We successfully transitioned the independent stores to GPI and retained the outstanding team members at a very high rate and focused much of our attention on maintaining the great relationships built by the BWP team. We continue to move forward with our more aggressive new store opening plan, adding 46 net new Advance stores and 5 net new Autoparts International stores during the quarter. Mike will provide a little more detail on our new store openings during the quarter. We continue to be delighted by the performance of our newer classes of stores, with our 2012 class of stores continuing to outperform our expectations and our 2013 class of stores meeting our expectations during the quarter. Our fourth priority, improving our in-store execution, is supported by our new tools to measure personal productivity to help place our best salespeople during the hours of the days of the week with the highest amount of traffic. Also, we are working to improve the level of individual effectiveness to maximize every customer engagement. These efforts are simply tied to improving our schedule effectiveness and increasing our customer order size by providing our customers with the full solution all the time in order for them to get the job done right the first time. We are still progressing towards our goals, however, we continue to improve our results, which are reflected in our increase in average ticket size. Five, and finally, improving our profitability through increasing our efficiency throughout our support areas and our store operating model. Our leaders have been working locally and collectively to identify and deliver efficiencies in our business that will put us on a trajectory to achieve accelerated profitability and reduce the SG&A-per-store gap versus our industry peers. Additionally, we have developed long-term incentive programs designed to accelerate both the growth and profitability. Collectively, our company priorities remain intensely focused on operations to drive results through customer service, enabled through outstanding and consistent execution. In closing, I'd like to share an example of how team members bring Service is our Best Part, to life. As we've mentioned, we have been very excited about our new service model of daily replenishment in our Remington distribution center and have increased the availability of parts that it has helped us achieve for our customers in those markets. With any new facility with the new team members, it is always important to have someone who is a constant champion of the customer. For Devon Kurtz [ph], the AGM in Remington, this comes naturally. No matter the question or special request to help serve our store customers, he always has the same positive purposeful approach of doing whatever he needs to do to provide that help, to provide that service and to get the job done. He provides a constant focus of quality and integrity with the Team Members in the facility with a calm, continual reminder of the importance of providing great service out to the stores and our customers. Thank you, Devon [ph] , for being a leader in Remington and for the company. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their continued efforts to improve our business and serve our customers as we navigate through a challenging first quarter and start to our year. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights for our first quarter of 2013; two, put our first quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2013. As we shared on our fourth quarter earnings call, we anticipated our first quarter would be challenging, given the industry softness carryover from 2012, tougher sales comparisons, the annualization of 2012 new stores, along with the heavy concentration of stores opened in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher incentive compensation. That was further magnified with the first 90 days being even more challenging than we anticipated, especially in DIY, driven by higher payroll taxes, delayed tax refunds and a slow start to spring. While we are never satisfied when we do not meet our expectations, we were pleased with our discipline to make adjustments during the quarter as we responded to a softer sales environment. These adjustments, along with the stronger sales in the last 2 weeks of our first quarter, allowed us to deliver a somewhat better bottom line performance than we anticipated and shared out at the beginning of April. As I mentioned to you last quarter, we continue to remain focused on influencing the things that are in our direct control and positioning our company for long-term growth and profitability by maintaining our strategic focus, executing on the fundamentals and simplifying our operations. As a result of the weaker consumer demand, our comp store sales decreased 3.2%. Our total sales, however, increased 3% to over $2 billion, driven by the acquisition of BWP and the net addition of 163 new stores over the past 12 months. Our comp store sales decrease was driven by declines in our DIY sales, partially offset by a positive growth in commercial sales. Our gross profit rate in the first quarter was 50% versus 50.1% in the first quarter of 2012, or a decrease of 8 basis points. This was slightly above our expectations for the quarter. The decrease was primarily due to the planned increase in supply chain costs associated with the full operation of our new Remington DC and the impact of BWP sales, which have a lower gross margin rate due to their higher mix of commercial sales, partially offset by continued improvements in our shrink rate. Our SG&A rate of 39.9% increased 127 basis points versus the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to expense deleverage as a result of our 3.2% comp store sales decline and increased new store openings, partially offset by lower advertising expense due to our adjustments related to the softer industry sales environment and a decrease in credit card fees as a result of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program. All in, our operating income was $204.1 million, which was a decrease of 9.1% versus the first quarter of 2012. This was in line with our outlook we shared during our fourth quarter conference call, due to our stronger finish during the last 2 weeks of our first quarter and our team's disciplined focus on expense management. Our operating income rate decreased 135 basis points to 10.1% in the first quarter. Our EPS decreased 7.8% versus Q1 last year to $1.65 per share and includes $0.01 of transition costs associated with the integration of BWP. We still anticipate the transition of BWP will occur over an 18-month period and the cost associated with 2013 to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20. Our free cash flow usage of $105.9 million for the quarter was primarily the result of the acquisition of BWP. Excluding the net impact of the acquisition, our free cash flow would have been $72 million compared to $153.1 million in the first quarter of 2012. Our owned inventory decreased 12.8% versus Q1 2012, primarily due to our efforts to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which is now at 86.7% versus 82.5% in the first quarter of 2012. Our total inventory increased 15%, driven by our new Remington DC, more hubs, more new stores and the acquisition of BWP. This increase was slightly higher than our expectations due to our lower-than- anticipated sales performance. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 767,000 shares at an average price of $76.72. At the end of our quarter, we had roughly $434 million left under our share repurchase authorization, and our average diluted share count was 73.8 million shares. At the end of our first quarter, we had roughly $605 million of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2.2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. We continue to measure the performance of our business with the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. We continue to prioritize growth as our primary use of capital in order to increase returns and drive shareholder value. As a result, our focus continues to be on accelerating our commercial growth and stabilizing our DIY business. Our goal to achieve this is by improving our availability through our hub stores, inventory upgrades, supply-chain investments and strengthening our market position with increased new store openings. We are very proud of our improved coverage and in-market availability, driven by the areas Darren covered. We are also proud of the accelerated pace of our new stores openings, including the net addition of 175 new stores during the quarter, including the acquisition of BWP, which added 124 commercially- oriented new stores in the Northeast; the opening of 49 new Advance Auto Parts stores; and the opening of 7 new Autopart International stores. Additionally, we closed 3 Advance stores and 2 Autopart International stores. At the end of Q1, our total store count was 3,969, and we remain on pace to open 170 to 190 new Advance Auto Parts stores and Autopart International stores this year. Turning to profit. While we did not meet our profit expectations for the quarter, we are pleased by how our team responded in the face of a slower sales environment to make adjustments that helped our profits. As we shared recently, we have recommitted ourselves to getting to 12% operating margins over the next 3 years. The pathway to 12% is going to be modest gross profit rate improvement and a significant improvement in our cost efficiency and execution. We have aligned our leadership and incentive programs around this goal. Three big drivers around our cost will be improvements in our labor productivity, developing a more flexible cost model that flexes with sales and reducing administrative and support costs furthest away from the customer. For example, we have developed tools that allow us to set goals and measure individual team member productivity, and we expect to see improvements in our dollars per transaction. We also have a high fixed cost model that needs to scale better as sales flex. Finally, we have to get more efficient with our costs, including lowering our cost furthest away from the customer. We have made significant investments in our business and capabilities in the last 5 years, and those investments came with the expectations of lower support costs, supply chain, professional services, occupancy costs, to name a few. As a result of a commitment to build a more competitive cost structure while funding strategic investments and to employ a more disciplined approach to cost management, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased slightly to $651,000 per store in our first quarter versus $656,000 per store during the first quarter of 2012. With respect to value creation, we have maintained our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.1%. For the quarter, our ROIC decreased 223 basis points versus the first quarter last year as a result of our increased invested capital through the acquisition of BWP, the in-sourcing of our commercial credit and the accelerated pace of our new store openings. Also impacting ROIC is our lower operating performance, driven by the lower sales environment. Longer term, we see opportunities to improve our ROIC as we begin to generate benefits from our Remington DC, our acquisition of BWP and as our sales from our new store openings begin to ramp. We also see opportunities to reduce our net owned inventory as we move towards our goal of achieving an AP ratio of 100%. Turning to the balance of the year. We continue to be confident that the fundamentals of our industry remain strong and are encouraged by our positive comp store sales performance so far in Q2, driven by our improved performance in the Northeast. Our optimism is somewhat tempered by our soft first quarter, which is our longest and historically strongest quarter, and slow start to spring. It is unclear how much of our strong start to Q2 is the result of a bounce-back from the delayed spring versus a fundamental rebound in consumer demand. Therefore, we think it's prudent to temper our full year expectations. We now anticipate that our comp store sales will be flat to slightly positive for the full year, and we will continue to make the appropriate adjustments to our costs in a disciplined way to adjust to these sales trends. It is still early enough in the year that we are maintaining our annual outlook. But given the softness in Q1 and slow start to spring, we now expect we will be at the lower end of our previously-shared annual outlook of $5.30 to $5.45. In closing, we are committed to our strategies in commercial and availability and remain confident in the industry fundamentals and how we are positioned as a company. We are focused on improving our top and bottom line and strengthening our returns to continue to drive shareholder value. We also want to thank our 54,000 team members who lead us every day with their relentless focus on service and commitment to operational excellence and execution, which are key ingredients to delivering on our goals. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Also joining us today on the call will be Elwyn Murray, EVP, Merchandising, Supply Chain and Technology. Jack? Jack Brouillard Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Over the past three months, I have had the opportunity to work closely with our management team as well as to visit our stores and distribution facilities and speak with many of our dedicated team members. I believe our team has made significant progress in this short period of time in taking the steps to position us to strengthen our business as we go forward. I want to give you an overview of our second quarter results and outline the steps we are taking to improve our sales, our earnings and return on capital. In the second quarter, we saw a continuation of the disappointing sales trends we experienced in the first quarter. Comp store sales grew by 1.3%. As Jim will discuss later, our comp sales results were stronger excluding our Florida and the Gulf Coast stores. Gross margin grew by 51 basis points, which was less than the growth in the first quarter and in line with our expectations. SG&A deleveraged by 41 basis points as a result of our low 1.3% comp store sales increase. Earnings per diluted share grew $8.5 to 60.	8.5% to $0.64. Our guidance had been for comp store sales growth in the low single-digit range and earnings per share in the range of $0.65 to $0.69. Second quarter results included costs of $0.01 per share related to the CEO transition and other severance costs. I want to discuss the steps we are taking to improve our performance. As I mentioned on our last call, our recent strategy review confirmed that we must return to the basics of being a parts store to reinvigorate our sales growth. The in-depth customer research on both DIY and commercial customers provided us good insight and background for our action plans. We believe the following key initiatives are critical to growing our sales. First, we are improving our parts availability to better meet the needs of our core customer segments. We have developed and are implementing a plan to increase parts availability in our stores. We believe this will drive improvement in both our DIY and commercial sales. The plan is focused on greater late model and foreign vehicle coverage as well as being more aggressive in getting parts into our stores and closer to our customers. We have used input from our store managers and our parts professionals as well as internal and external data to make our decisions. Some of this increase in coverage is already in the process of being distributed to our stores and most will be completed before year end. Jill will discuss the impact of these decisions on our inventory investment. At the same time that we are increasing parts availability, we have implemented an aggressive program to free up dollars invested in less productive inventory to fund a portion of this investment. Also, to increase our parts availability and inventory productivity over the longer term, we have reprioritized our information technology projects to improve our custom mix, our merchandising and inventory management tools. Second, we are increasing our commercial focus to take greater advantage of the full potential of the large and growing commercial market. We believe that over the last few quarters, we have missed meaningful opportunities to drive our commercial sales and as a result our comp growth in this area has slowed. While 5% to 6% comps are respectable, we believe they fall short of our potential in this area. Increased parts availability will be a component of this improvement. However, we are taking a look at everything we are doing in this area to increase our commercial sales growth. Our commercial research as well as our continued learnings from Autopart International give us more insight on how to further grow this business. We are looking at store staffing and training, compensation structures, truck utilization and many other areas to optimize our structure for further commercial growth. You will be hearing more about this over the next several quarters. Third, we are changing our previous focus on the front room. As part of our ongoing business review, we have begun to improve the efficiency of our work on the sales floor or front room portion of our stores. Among other things, we are streamlining our front room assortments where applicable and reducing the frequency of tasks such as planogram changes. This wok in improving efficiency and sales productivity will continue throughout the remainder of the year. In addition to growing our sales, we will make more progress on reducing our SG&A and improving our return on invested capital throughout our company by realigning our investments to the customer segments that provide us the greatest opportunity of return. To have a meaningful impact, we must make structural changes in how we operate instead of just marginal reductions through business as usual. Over the past several weeks, we have made decisions in a number of areas that will reduce certain SG&A expenses by more than $20 million in the second half of 2007 and over $50 million in 2008 and that will reduce CapEx investment by $20 million in the second half of 2007 and over $65 million in 2008. Some of those decisions are as follows. We announced yesterday a reduction in our field and store support center of 250 positions including 175 field positions and 75 budgeted and open positions which are now closed. I want o emphasize that none of these positions are in our stores. We are assisting this group of team members to transition to the next step in their careers and we want to thank them for their service to the company. We will reduce our new store growth in 2007 to 190 to 200 stores and in 2008 to 140 to 150 Advance Auto Parts and Autopart International stores. We are also anticipating relocating 20 stores in 2008 compared to 35 in 2007. We believe this is a prudent step for us to take while we work on getting our comp sales growth restarted, improving our operating results and further refining our new store operating model. We have halted our 2010 store remodel program because our research showed our customers are not giving us credit for this significant investment and our recent sales show it is not delivering the expected results. We will be reevaluating our go forward remodel plans. We will of course continue to perform routine store maintenance. Our store base is in very good shape overall. In fact, over 2700 stores or 87% of our store base has been opened, relocated or remodeled since 1999. We have discontinued our Advance TV network in our stores. Again, through our customer research, we have determined that our customers did not give us credit for this substantial investment. We have eliminated certain advertising expenditures that we determined were not productive in driving our sales. We are testing and measuring other portions including our print advertising program, and the results of those tests will drive our advertising decisions for 2008. We have evaluated all of our planned CapEx investments in logistics, IT and every other support area of the company and have eliminated those investments that did not demonstrate an acceptable return and realigned all others to support our go forward strategy. These are just a few of the areas where we have made decisions to reduce and redirect expense and capital and this is the beginning of a more cost conscious and return-oriented culture in our company. We already have under way the evaluation of the next structural expense reductions that will be needed to refit our company to support the findings from our strategy review. We will share them with you over the coming quarters. Some areas we are looking at include the productivity of our field and commercial transportation expenses, reducing our store occupancy costs, lowering our non-merchandising purchasing costs and many other key areas. We believe the steps we are taking to drive sales and reduce expenses are positioning us much better to support a more effective strategy as we go forward. As Jill will discuss further, we will see the positive impact of the expense reduction in the third and fourth quarters. We believe we'll see some impact from the sales drivers over these next two quarters, but we expect it to be minimal in the short term. Internally, it will take us most of this time period to implement our initiatives and externally, the economic headwinds may continue to be a negative for sales growth for the remainder of the year. We believe high gas prices have reduced our customers' ability to pay for needed repairs and have increased maintenance deferrals. We anticipate that over time customers will adjust their budgets and we will see a benefit when this deferred maintenance is performed. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jim and Jill who will review further our second quarter results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. Jim? Jim L. Wade Thank you, Jack, and good morning. I'll provide a further breakdown of our sales and store growth for the second quarter and then Jill will discuss gross margin, SG&A as well as the balance sheet and cash flow. As Jack mentioned, our comp store sales came in at the low end of our guidance at 1.3% compared to 1.2% last year. During the quarter, our sales challenges were consistent with what we had experienced in the first quarter. We did see some signs that we thought indicated strengthening at the beginning of the quarter, but as we entered the summer season, there was no consistent trend over the remainder of the quarter. On a geographic basis, sales continue to be stronger in the North and Midwest and weaker in Florida and the Gulf Coast market. Certainly, a portion of the weakness in Florida and the Gulf Coast relates to the cycling of the post-hurricane sales surge. However, as that is now cycled, we have not seen significant improvement and the overall economic trends in these markets appear not to have strengthened yet. Just as a comparison, our comps excluding Florida and the Gulf Coast were 2.8% in the second quarter. During the second quarter, our DIY comps were a negative point 0.1% compared to a negative 1% last year. Our commercial comps were 5.8% over 9.1% last year. This comp was consistent with the first quarter. As Jack mentioned, we are in the process of refocusing on getting our commercial comps back to a double-digit run rate we had previously achieved. Commercial sales including AI represented 26.1% of our total sales. For the quarter, our total commercial sales were $305.2 million, an 11.5% increase over last year. Commercial is a faster growing segment of the auto aftermarket, and we believe it can continue to become a larger portion of that business. During the quarter, we added 32 new commercial programs, most of which were on our new stores, bringing the total number of Advance stores with commercial programs to 2525. Today, about 82% of our Advance stores have commercial programs, the same percentage as last year. Autopart International continued to grow with an additional 13 stores so far in 2007, bringing their total store count to 100. AI celebrated recently the opening of their 100th store with another new store in New Jersey as well as their 50th year in business. For the first quarter, AI contributed $33.9 million in sales. In the second quarter, we opened 43 new stores. 38 of these new stores opened as Advance Auto Parts and 5 as Autopart International. year-to-date, we have opened 113 new stores, 100 of Advance and 13 of AI. We closed 6 stores in the quarter and 8 year-to-date. Our new store productivity remained comparable to last year. In line with our plans to open 140 to 150 new stores in 2008, we have reduced our planned openings to 190 to 200 stores for 2007. We had previously indicated 200 to 210 new stores in 2007. This represents an approximate 6% rate of growth in 2007 and 4.5% in 2008. In 2007 and 2008, we anticipate all of our new stores will open within our existing 40 state footprint. We have also remodeled 61 stores year-to-date. The reduced scope [ph] remodels we started earlier this year significantly reduced our costs. However, not enough time has passed to measure the sales results and ROI from these remodels. As a result, we are halting the remodel program until we have had time to evaluate how we can achieve a higher return on invested capital and better align the program with the findings from our customer research. We have allocated sufficient CapEx in our budget for 2007 and 2008 to maintain our stores on a regular basis during this period. year-to-date, we have relocated 19 stores and foresee approximately 35 relocations in 2007. As Jack mentioned, we anticipate approximately 20 relocations in 2008 as we further evaluate how to increase the return on these investments. Included in our next round of CapEx and SG&A targets is a complete review of our occupancy cost. We believe the findings from our strategy review provide us a significant opportunity to reduce the occupancy cost for our new stores through building and site cost reductions. With our real estate activity in 2007, we ended the quarter with 3087 Advance Auto Part stores and 100 Autopart International stores for a total store count of 3187 stores. Now let me turn the call over to Jill to review our financial result. Jill A. Livesay Thanks Jim and good morning. Let me begin with our reported earnings. Earnings per diluted share were $0.64, which was slightly below our earnings guidance of $0.65 to $0.69 per share. Our earnings guidance did not include costs of $0.01 per share related to the CEO transition and other severance costs. For the quarter, gross margin was 48.1%, a 51 basis point improvement over last year. This reflects improved procurement costs and lower logistics expense. As part of our improved procurement costs, LIFO was a $3.3 million credit in this year's quarter compared to a $5.6 million credit in last year's quarter. Going forward, we expect modest LIFO credits in most quarters as we benefit from lower costs in most product categories. Turing now to SG&A. Our SG&A expense rate for the quarter rose 41 basis points compared to last year. This increase was primarily due to a 50 basis point increase in fixed expenses as a result of low comp sales and expenses of $1.5 million or 13 basis points related to the CEO transition and other severance costs. These items were partially offset by savings in other expense lines. With the expense reductions Jack outlined, we expect to leverage SG&A in the second half of the year. The SG&A leverage in the second half before severance and asset write offs of $6.4 million or 57 basis points. With the expense reductions we have made thus far and further reductions under review, we believe we can leverage SG&A on less than a 3% comp going forward. Interest expense net of interest income was $6.9 million in the quarter compared to $8.8 million last year, primarily due to lower borrowing rates and higher cash balances this year compared to last year. Approximately 65% of our debt is hedged to fixed rates and our current borrowing cost is just over 6% at today's rate. Our second quarter income tax rate was 38.3% as compared to 38.1% last year. Going forward, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 38.4% to 38.6%. In terms of the key components our balance sheet and our cash flow statement, for the quarter, inventory increased 8.9% on a sale increase of 5.6%, in line with our performance in the first quarter. The rate of inventory growth was greater than the sales growth due to one, expanded parts assortments in selected stores; two, second quarter sales coming in below expectations and three, an inventory build in the new AI distribution center during its opening. In the third and forth quarter, we will be making investments in parts availability. We expect to offset a portion of this investment by increase the productivity of our existing inventory, rebalancing inventory on selected categories and selected stores. As a result of this parts availability initiative, we expect that inventory will grow somewhat faster than sales in the second half of the year, but the spread between inventory growth and sales growth will be less than in the second quarter. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 57.1% compared to 57% last year. We continue to see opportunity to grow our AP ratio. On the cash flow statement, our CapEx was $39.8 million for the quarter and $115.7 million year-to- date, lower than the $54.1 million and $132 million spent last year respectively. As Jack discussed, we are taking a number of steps to reduce our capital spending and improve our return on invested capital. We now estimate capital expenditures for 2007 to be $230 million to $240 million as compared to our previous estimate of $250 million to $270 million. This estimate includes approximately $25 million for our 9th distribution center in Indiana. As a result of fewer new store openings in 2007 and 2008, we have delayed the opening of our next distribution center from mid-2008 until the beginning of 2009, which will help our SG&A leverage in 2008. With the reduction in CapEx, we expect free cash flow to grow by more than 80% in 2007 to a range of $150 million to $170 million for the year. This is an increase from our prior guidance of $125 million to $145 million. In the second quarter, we repurchased 95,000 shares. So far in the third quarter, we have repurchased  an additional 890,000 shares. In addition, the Board of Directors yesterday approved a $500 million share repurchase program which replaces the $300 million share repurchase program which is nearly completed. As we have said before, we expect to continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases specifically are a key part of our capital allocation strategy, and as we look at the returns on investments within the business as compared to investments in our stock at its current price range, we find share repurchases to be very attractive. In terms of updated guidance, for comp store sales we are assuming negative 2% to flat in the third quarter and flat to 2% in the fourth quarter. We are basing our guidance on the assumption that a challenging macroeconomic environment will continue throughout the balance of the year, and because of the implementation timeframe, our sales building initiatives will positively impact second half sales to a limited degree. For the second half, we expect minimal improvements in gross margin percent as we work through the inventory and merchandising initiatives we have discussed. Also, we expect to start leveraging SG&A in the second half as a result of expense initiatives we have implemented. We expect earnings per diluted share in the third quarter to be $0.53 to $0.57 and for the year to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.32. Included in the third quarter guidance and 2007 year guidance is approximately $0.04 in severance costs and asset write offs associated with the reduction in workforce and halting of our Advance TV network. We believe that all of the steps we are taking certainly position us to improve sales, reduce SG&A and improve return on invested capital going forward. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Jack. Jack Brouillard Thanks Jill. In closing, I would like to again thank our team members for their commitment over this past quarter as we make some difficult but necessary decisions. In the lifecycle of every company, there are times when there are growing pains that we must go through to unleash the next cycle of our growth. I believe this is one of those times and the changes we are making now come at the cost, but will allow us to turn our attention to achieving our full potential as we go forward. I look forward to seeing you all in my travels over the next few months. We are now ready for questions. Operator? Question And Answer"
150,GV_145977_2008Q2,"Presentation Operator Before we begin, Judd Nystrom, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forwardlooking statements that will be made on this call.

Any statements that are not related to historical facts are forwardlooking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forwardlooking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including those listed from time to time in the company's annual report, on Form 10K, and its other filings with the SEC. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize or if the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, the company's actual results may differ materially from anticipated results discussed in these forwardlooking statements. The company intends these forwardlooking statements to speak only as of the time of the conference call, does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. Our results can be found in our press release and 8-K filing which are available on our website at For planning purposes, our third quarter earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, October 29, after market close and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, October 30. To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through our Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now, let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and CEO, who will be followed by Elwyn Murray, EVP, Customer Development Officer, DIY; Jim Wade, EVP, Customer Development Officer, Commercial; and Mike Norona, EVP and CFO. Darren Jackson Good morning and welcome to our 2008 second quarter conference call. I want to begin by personally thanking our Advance and AI team members for continuing to deliver outstanding customer service and financial results in the second quarter. The 23% increase in earnings per share reflects the team members' commitment and progress on our four strategies. We have a saying at Advance, which is “sell more parts, have more fun”. My view is, sell more parts, have more fun on the conference call. So let's begin. We are 180 days into our AAP turnaround, and we're on track from my perspective. More importantly, we're beginning to build pockets of momentum. Our goal is simple. Grow to $10 billion in sales in the next five years by focusing on our four key strategies. Our commercial acceleration, DIY transformation, availability excellence, and experience strategies are all gaining traction. To make our turnaround happen, it takes commitment and dedication from every Advance team member to live our Advance values, try change, and embrace the future. Q2 was a great step in our turnaround journey. Here are a couple of highlights for the quarter. Comp  store sales increased 2.9%. What's interesting is this is the first quarter in nine quarters that comps were positive in all four areas of the country, including Florida. Our commercial business continues to be the driver. Commercial continues to accelerate with comp sales growth of 13.5% in Q2. DIY comp sales trends improved as well, to negative 0.8% in the quarter. That's up from the past two quarters when DIY comps were down 3%. Finally, our operating income grew 9%, which allowed us to leverage our share repurchase into a 23% EPS increase. Mike will share with you more about how these results fit into the broader financial picture going forward. Our strategies continue to progress as well. For example, we conducted a DIY summit that identified key themes and ideas to grow and transform the DIY business. Now this approach was similar to our parts summit conducted last year which led to our parts focus as a company. More importantly, we are seeking, actively seeking, feedback from the front line team and using it to make improvements to our DIY business. Elwyn will share with you the progress for making that focus on DIY customer needs. We're pleased to welcome several new field operations leaders in the quarter. They are Derrick Thomas, Carl Hauch, Dan Peterson, and Dave Hamilton, who are firmly engaged in our superior experience strategy. I am excited about the passion and the experience around customer service and team member engagement these leaders bring to Advance. Each of these leaders is already making an impact on the business. Still, this year is proving to be a challenging one for customers and team members alike. The current economic crisis is a constant reminder that our turnaround and transformation efforts must go beyond the traditional approach. More importantly, the changes we need to make are not optional. Our company must drive change versus being driven by change. The truth is that we're moving in the right direction. Even so, we still have a long way to go from our destination. I remain guarded about the economic environment, which continues to be challenging to navigate with consumer confidence near a 16year low. Weakening business and job conditions, along with record high gas prices, are a heavy burden for many of our customers. Our second quarter results are very encouraging, yet we may have benefited from the economic stimulus which could have accelerated some sales from the second half of this year. As a result, our outlook remains balanced for the remainder of the year. We will continue to assess, adjust, and focus our resources to accelerate the execution of our key strategies. Our new commercial team is a great example of this focus. Jim will talk about that in a minute. Our longterm objective remains the same. We remain committed to a future that is leading, not lagging behind the industry. We remain committed to a future that's great, not good. We remain committed to a future that tries to change, not one that reacts to it. Most importantly, we remain committed to winning with superior team members, serving customers better than anyone else, and growing the business and profitability with integrity. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Elwyn Murray to provide a progress update on DIY. Elwyn Murray I, too, am encouraged by our second quarter results and would like to express my thanks and appreciation to our team as well. I attribute the success to our team and the traction we are gaining on many of our strategic initiatives. Today, I would like to cover two things. First, update you on the actions that we are taking now to turn around our current DIY business trend and second, provide further visibility to our emerging thinking to drive to full potential in DIY as we know it today and also transform our retail business. We are making tangible progress in several areas that are impacting our current results. Specifically, we are gaining meaningful traction through our parts inventory investments, the launch of our attachment selling initiative, and our efforts to improve weekend scheduling. We are in the infancy of addressing our full potential to improving bilingual staffing, identifying new categories to tap, and measuring our team member engagement and customer satisfaction. Our attachment selling strategy is more than pushing items to customers. It is a sales approach enabling team members to be eager, trusted problem solvers for our customers. With our help and advice, customers get everything they need on their first visit, saving them gas, time, and trouble. In addition, attachment selling helps us grow our sales and margin. Attachment selling is truly a winwin for our customers and our company. We are currently tracking our attachment rate to allow our leadership team to better assess their team members' sales skills and identify where training opportunities exist to better serve our customers while growing our sales. Division Manager Kyle [Wideman] in Buffalo, New York, understands the significance of attachment selling. His store teams are fully embracing the strategy under his leadership, guidance, and support, and are producing some of the highest sales results in recent weeks. Kyle says the key to attachment selling is simple, serve the customer better than anyone else. He says his team is passionate about serving the customer by having the parts knowledge and selling the complete job. He is very proud of his team for all of their hard work and dedication to help our customers keep the wheels turning, and we are very proud of Kyle and his leadership. We are also in the process of measuring how well we inspire and engage our team members and how well we serve our customers. Engaged team members bring their best game to work every day and are deeply committed to the success of our customers, our stores, and our company. Loyal customers repurchase, buy additional items, and refer other customers, all of which help grow our sales and margin. It is no coincidence that a highly engaged workforce is strongly correlated with great customer service. That's why it's so important to understand how well we are doing in these two areas. We are committed to defining what great customer service looks like, to measure it and to consistently improve. We look forward to sharing more information with you about these results and the impact they are making later this year. Currently, we are approximately 75 days into our 100day assessment of our DIY business, which is focused on driving the full potential in DIY, as we know it today and also transforming our retail business. In this pursuit, as Darren mentioned, we conducted a DIY summit and DIY growth workshop during this second quarter. These sessions produced several key themes and hundreds of ideas straight from the field. We are prioritizing these opportunities based on customer interest, market attractiveness, and proximity to our core. We anticipate these ideas resulting in pilots and/or rollout, depending on the nature of the idea, beginning as early as the fourth quarter. We are also taking action to enhance the speed and capability of our team in order to accelerate the transformation of our DIY retail space. We have decided to locate our sales floor merchandising team, which accounts for over 50% of DIY business today, in our regional office in Minneapolis. This location will allow us to more readily add talent from nearby retail and consumer [inaudible] companies, as well as network and benchmark with other retailers with similar systems and practices. Approximately 70 positions will be located in Minneapolis as part of the sales floor integrated operating team. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the traction we are gaining and the results we are seeing from the near-term initiatives mentioned. I am confident that opportunities like bilingual staffing, new product categories and services, and our customer satisfaction and team member engagement initiatives will make meaningful contributions in future quarters as well. While encouraged by our progress, we recognize that more will be required of us in order to achieve our longer-term vision of a $10 billion company that produces $2.5 million per store comprised of a 50/50 mix of retail and commercial sales. To that end, we remain committed to optimizing our near-term initiatives, as well as developing additional sales ideas in order to transform our DIY business, as we know it today. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Wade I want to congratulate our store chains, our commercial sales force, and our commercial organization on their 13.5% commercial comp sales increase in the second quarter. Our team has driven solid sequential comp sales improvements over the last five quarters, but we still only have approximately a 3% market share. There is still great room for accelerated commercial growth. We're taking actions and building plans to achieve our full potential and significantly grow our commercial market share. Our commercial sales increases are coming first and foremost from unleashing the enthusiasm and passion of our team and empowering them to do what they do best, which is serve our customers better than anyone else. I want to share one example of how a commercial team member is living our values and moving our commercial acceleration strategy forward. During his time as the area commercial sales manager, Bill [inaudible] was the leader in commercial sales growth with significantly higher results in his region. Bill is known for developing his commercial sales team and for partnering with the store team to provide great service to his customers. Bill was recently promoted to an area commercial sales director. In his new role, Bill now leads a quarter of our commercial sales force and is using his winning strategies to further accelerate our growth. Thank you and congratulations, Bill. Beyond our team, we continue to work very hard on the basics of the business. We're focusing on our strengths and getting the parts quickly delivered to the garage so our customers can better grow their businesses. We're partnering with availability excellence team to aggressively add parts to our stores and move them closer to our customers throughout our supply chain. We're capitalizing on the well-respected brands we've added to our stores over the past year. And we're working to further develop and strengthen our team of parts knowledgeable people. The last thing we're focusing on being a reliable partner that the garage can consistently count on. In addition to the basics, we're making good progress in formalizing our commercial sales force and providing the information they need to focus on our highest potential customers. We're developing systems to identify those customers where we have the best opportunity to deepen our existing relationship and grow our share of their purchases by acquiring new customers so we can further accelerate our total growth. We're also formalizing our processes for targeting customers, tracking our progress, and insuring we keep them once they are buying from us. As part of our commercial model development, we continue to pilot several different initiatives that are common within our industry and to look at other distribution businesses outside our industry. The results of these pilots are being built into our commercial model and rolled out on a larger scale as they're developed. These pilots include everything from how we allocate resources, to how we staff our stores, to how our sales force targets customers. This will continue to be a key part of our process for developing and improving our commercial model. Over time, we believe we can develop additional value added services that will further increase our customer attraction and retention. We're developing a business model for how we conduct and grow our commercial business while building accountability and a culture with customer service for commercial that is rooted in our Advance values. At the heart of commercial acceleration is partnership. By arming our commercial sales force and our store teams with the information and tools they need to keep customers base turning, we will build loyalty. To date, we built strong local partnerships, but the real key to our commercial business success is to put the full power of our company behind its development. During the second quarter, in addition to strong commercial sales increases, we continue to see all of our key profitability metrics grow at the same time. That included higher parts productivity, increased truck and driver utilization, and the higher balance of parts sales. I'd also like to thank the Autopart International team for a strong second quarter, as they significantly increased sales and profitability. Overall, they produced a 7.2% comp to the quarter. They also opened 10 stores, which included the acquisition of a fivestore local parts distributor. This acquisition provided AI the opportunity to strengthen its presence in the Philadelphia market. Switching to new store development, in the second quarter, we opened 36 stores, to bring our total for the year to 70. We also closed two stores and relocated four stores. At the end of the second quarter, out total store count was 3,325. During our first quarter call, we indicated we'd be reviewing our store performance and real estate portfolio. As a result of our recent review, we anticipate closing approximately 20 to 30 underperforming stores for all of 2008, with the majority occurring during the third and fourth quarters. Over the last six months, we've been testing smaller prototype buildings and different store layouts to improve our new store productivity and reduce occupancy costs while increasing our parts availability. We started rolling out our 6,000 square foot prototype as we opened new stores, in place of our current 7,000 square foot store. We'll continue to measure results and build a prototype that best serves the needs of both our DIY and commercial customers, as well as improving results for our shareholders. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike to review our financial results. Mike Norona It's enjoyable to share our strong second quarter results with you. Clearly, these results are directly attributable to our talented and dedicated team members who are leading change, embracing our turnaround, and focusing on serving our customers. I have planned to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide an overview of our second quarter results. Two, link the actions we are taking to transform our business to our shortterm financial performance. Three, share our philosophy on our four performance gauges as we look to improve our mid to longterm financial performance. Turning to our second quarter, total revenue increased 5.6% to $1.24 billion compared with revenue of $1.17 billion in the second quarter last year. This revenue increase reflected the net addition of 138 new stores in the past 12 months and a comp sales increase of 2.9% on top of a 1.2% increase last year. Yeartodate revenue is $2.76 billion. The comp sales gain is comprised of a 13.5% increase in commercial sales, partially offset by a 0.8% decrease in DIY sales. This compares to a 5.4% increase in commercial and 0.2% decrease in DIY in the second quarter of last year. Yeartodate, our comp sales have increased 1.6%. Our second quarter commercial sales represented 29% of our total sales compared to 26% last year. For the quarter, our total commercial sales were $358 million, resulting in a 17.2% increase over last year. Currently, 83% of Advance stores have commercial programs as compared to 82% last year. Clearly, our commercial teams are leading our company with a fantastic growth, despite a challenging economic environment. Our gross profit rate was 48.6% in the second quarter, as compared to 48.1% last year, which reflects a 51 basis point improvement. This improvement was primarily due to lower supply chain and logistics cost combined with more effective pricing. SG&A expenses were 38.3% of sales compared to 38% last year. This 23 basis point increase was driven by increased incentive compensation, increased spending on strategic initiatives, and higher gasoline expenses related to commercial delivery. Partially offsetting the SG&A increases were cost savings realized from actions taken last year combined with expense leverage as a result of a solid Q2 comp. Net interest expense was $7.3 million in the quarter compared to $6.9 million last year. Our current borrowing costs remain at approximately 5%. Earnings per share increased 23%, $0.79 for the quarter, as compared to $0.64 for the second quarter last year. This 23% increase in EPS was primarily driven by a 9% increase in operating income and the benefit of 13 million shares repurchased over the past year. For the first half of the year, our EPS has increased 22%. We're pleased with this increase. Now I will comment on a few items on our balance sheet and cash flow. For the quarter, inventory increased 8.1% to $507,000 per store. As previously communicated, the increase in inventory was driven by our parts availability initiative, as well as initial inventory buildup of our new MOOG and Wagner brands partially offset by our focus plan to improve inventory productivity. Inventory per store was slightly higher as compared to prior year, given we are funding the majority of our parts availability initiative through some inventory reduction initiative. I would personally like to thank Jim [North] and his team for all the work they're leading on our inventory upgrades and inventory reduction initiative. In Q2, our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 61.6% compared to 57.1% last year. While this increase is primarily driven by our inventory buildup, I am encouraged by the initial progress that our merchant team is making to improve this ratio. This initiative will have positive impacts to our cash flow in the future. Operating cash flow for the year increased $7 million to $350 million. Free cash flow for the year increased 25% to $244.6 million, which reflects a $48.7 million improvement as compared to last year. This increase is primarily driven by higher net income and lower owned inventory. Capital expenditures were $106 million for the year, as compared to $115.7 million last year. This decrease is primarily due to reduction in store development. To put our Q2 results in context, our sales, margin rate, and bottom line exceeded our expectations and our SG&A came in higher given the investments we are making in our strategic initiatives. I will share more on our SG&A profile later. Collectively, Q2 was an encouraging step forward in our turnaround journey. All strategies are starting to gain traction, with our commercial business leading the way. Now I would like to link the actions we are taking to transform our business to our shortterm financial performance, specifically our cost profile. Our turnaround involves transforming from primarily a retail business model to an integrated operating model that is focused on both retail and commercial customers. While this turnaround is absolutely the right thing needed to differentiate our company, it will put strain on our expenses in the short term. That is because our current capabilities, operating level, support mechanisms, systems, were primarily built to support a retail model. Therefore, our work entails performing indepth assessments of all the fundamental parts of our business and transforming them to support this new integrated retail and commercial model. Realistically, we think the changes are not simple on/off switches, which means you cannot immediately transition from one to the other. Usually, there is an overlap period where higher costs result from duplicity. To illustrate with an example, we have committed $60 million of multiyear capital and expense investments to build new merchandising systems and capabilities. These investments will enable us to better support both our retail and commercial businesses. Unfortunately, it takes time to build and implement these new systems and capabilities and, as such, we will have some added expenses in the short term as we build the new infrastructure while continuing to run our existing merchandising infrastructure. This simple example can be applied to many aspects of our business that need to change. Therefore, our challenge is twofold. We must continue to make the investments required to transform our business, for example, improving parts availability, investing in training and development of team members, and investing in delivery trucks and parts pros while at the same time looking for ways to fund these investments. It is critical that we do both. This can be accomplished by appropriately sequencing investments, getting more out of existing resources, and eliminating activities, capabilities, and resources that are no longer relevant to our new operating model. Lastly, I would like to share our focus on our four gauges as we look to improve our medium to longterm financial performance. We continue to believe these gauges provide a transparent and holistic financial view of our four strategies and will serve as a barometer of our progress. We are committed to improving our gauges, but we are not trailing the class of our competitors but are realistic that certain gauges will show progress before others. We anticipate seeing improvement in two of the gauges, sales per square foot and operating income per team member, first. We believe the positive momentum we have in commercial and the focus of our talented team members to embrace and lead our turnaround will help these gauges. We also anticipate seeing measured improvement in our incremental ROIC, given our new rigor around investments pending. That said, the large capital base, it will take time for new investments to move the total ROIC. Finally, given our shortterm expense needs required to build new capabilities and transform our business, we anticipate our focus on our SG&A per store gauge to be one fluctuating around its current level rather than reducing in the short term. We think this is prudent, as we believe investing in our business today will lead to higher sustained returns in the future. That said running a leaner costeffective operation will always be in our sights. As a reminder, the company provided an annual outlook at the beginning of the year and does not provide quarterly guidance. However, for fiscal year 2008, the company now anticipates leveraging SG&A at an increase of approximately 2% comparable sales versus the 1% increase previously disclosed. This increase is primarily driven by investments in merchandising capabilities and systems, e-commerce investments, and accelerating some test in commercial combined with the impact of rising fuel costs. We expect these increases will constrain profit growth for the balance of the year. In closing, we are pleased with our second quarter results and are excited about our longterm prospects given our renewed focus on the customer. We believe we are focused on the right four strategies and are committed to taking action and making the necessary investments required to create long-term shareholder value. While we remain cautiously optimistic over the shortterm economic headwinds, we remain vigilant to have our four gauges measure our progress. Most importantly, we are investing in and betting on our talented team members to lead us to our turnaround. We are now ready for questions."
151,GV_145977_2009Q2,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Second Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Before we begin, Judd Nystrom, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations will make a brief statement concerning forward- looking statements that will be made on this call. Judd T. Nystrom Former Senior Vice President of Finance Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I would like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially. The most important of these risks, as well as the reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call and the corresponding GAAP measures, are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. These can be found on our website at  For planning purposes, our third-quarter earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, November 11, 2009, aftermarket close and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, November 12, 2009. To be notified of the dates of the future earnings reports, you can sign up [Audio Gap]. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now, let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our CEO; who will be followed by Jim Wade, President; Kevin Freeland, Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Norona, Executive Vice President and CFO. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Judd. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. I'd like to begin by congratulating the team on another successful quarter. I'd like to point out that our positive results continue to be driven by the efforts of our 49,000 Advance team members. We're at the halfway point of fiscal 2009 and we remain on track to deliver a very good year. We are closing in on the end of our turnaround efforts or part one, which is the foundation of our story. The turnaround has been focused on: one, establishing the strategic direction with our four priorities, Commercial acceleration, DIY transformation, availability excellence and superior experience; two, restoring the core values of Advance, which are to inspire, serve and grow; three, identifying, recruiting and empowering a world-class leadership team; four, aligning our team around a focused set of meaningful and measurable goals; and finally five, building positive momentum, and this is just to a highlight a few. Overall, it has been a turnaround in leadership, confidence and focus versus a simple financial restructuring. We are now mapping out our transformation to become a customer experience leader in our industry. To date, our strategic progress is in line with our high expectations and we continue to be pleased with our financial outcome. We are encouraged with the double-digit comparable store sales gain in Commercial, coupled with posting our second consecutive quarter of positive DIY comp sales growth. These results are built on our improving customer satisfaction and team member calibration scores. I'm delighted with our team members focus on profitable growth, which has resulted in a dozen general managers being on track to earn $100,000 this year under our new incentive program. Overall, our bonus-eligible general managers achieved below double-digit comps in the first half of the year, resulting in a 30% increase in their bonus check. There are countless areas of the business that I'm excited about that are not readily apparent in our earnings release. Here's some specific examples. We recently launched a national performance dashboard. This new tool is important. It aligns and focus its all stores on the same set of measures and metrics. It also provides visibility for each store to see how they are performing, compared to stores in their peer group with similar characteristics, such as store sales potential, competitive sets of inventory level. And this peer group approach has allowed us to target sales and gross margin opportunities to improve performance and accelerate growth this year. We have recently launched a dedicated team of field leaders to accelerate our results by improving the speed and consistency, while reducing the variability of initiatives we implement in the field. We have learned, over the past year, that our speed and consistency of implementing new initiative must improve, to ensure we deliver the intended benefits in a swift and sustainable manner. This team makes up our implementation factory. In our test districts, this team helped cut our battery return rate in half, as an example, which we are now rolling to the balance of the chain. Kevin will speak about this later. We also have initiatives underway to test traffic counters and new PBX phone systems to measure customer demand. This is important, as our research has shown us that we have very large opportunity to better serve our customers, through understanding our in-store and phone traffic patterns. By measuring this, we will be able to better staff the demand. This will increase transactions, conversion rates, labor effectiveness, and most importantly, the customer experience. We are making progress on these initiatives as well as numerous other initiatives, such as launching our global sourcing capability, adding ACDelco to our parts assortment, rolling out our new stores learning system, expanding Autopart International's geographic reach, as well as testing AI within an existing AAP stores. And lastly, we are making terrific progress building out our e-commerce team in site, which will launch later this year. The ultimate success of these capabilities comes down to our people. Team calibration is a tool we use to assess our team's engagement levels. As a company, we achieved a 95% participation rate and increased our score from 65 last November, to 71 this quarter, an increase of 10%. This is one of our greatest accomplishments in the quarter. Our turnaround and upcoming transformation is dependent on the engagement and leadership of the entire Advance team. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction. Collectively, our focus on our customers, team members, growth and profitability, allowed us to increase sales 7%. Comp store sales increased 4.8%, while we delivered a 14% increase in our earnings per share, excluding the $0.06 EPS impact for store divestitures. This is on top of a 22% EPS increase last year during the second quarter. Our investment profile reflects our commitment to building capabilities to successfully compete and deliver a superior customer experience. Jim, Kevin and Mike will cover the details of our strategic and financial results later. The economic environment continues to be fragile. We recognize we have a little bit of a wind at our back in terms of our DIY business, and we acknowledge that those winds could shift tomorrow. However, we remain committed in building capabilities to lead in our industry over time, using the customer as our compass in transforming our business model to one that provides for long-term sustainable growth, profitability and value creation. As we round out the second half of 2009 and prepare for 2010, we will take what we've learned and transform our business for our team, our customers and our shareholders. Becoming a customer experience leader is a choice, it just doesn't happen. My time at Advance has taught me that our team has the passion and the conviction to take the lead. Our team continues to show me that their commitment to advancing the experience for our customers is what differentiates Advance. Here's an example, last month, our greater leadership team spent time with 15,000 commercial customers to thank them for their partnership and business. Jim will share more details with you about our customer commercial appreciation week, but I wanted to share with you some thoughts that came directly from our customers during the week that I visited with them and our team. Their comments demonstrate we are truly on track with our turnaround and transformation. I spent some time in Indiana and received terrific feedback about our Commercial Account Manager, Aaron Bigsley [ph]. The feedback that I heard over and over from our Commercial customers was that they were choosing Advance because of our people, from our Commercial parts pros to our Commercial account managers. Our custom mix investments, parts pro investments, delivery truck investments are enabling our teams to do what they do best, serve our customers with confidence, and consistency. More importantly, they are choosing Advance Auto Parts because our team will go above and beyond selling parts to serve customers, like Aaron does with routinely. I visited one Commercial account district manager who had a large 21-store district and is proud to support Advance with their entire district. We spoke of the and above and beyond steps that Aaron has taken. For example, he serves by focusing on businesses needs, which included facilitating meetings with the customers managers and the Advance general managers to further develop opportunities in the relationship between the two businesses. By the way, our business with this client is up double digits. To sum it up, Aaron provides the total Advance experience to Commercial customers that he services and proof can be seen in the sales results for his area and through the fantastic relationships and partnerships he has developed in his market. Thanks to you and your team, Aaron for serving our customers better than anyone else in growing our business. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim to provide a progress update on our Commercial acceleration and DIY transformation strategy. Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank our store teams, our Commercial sales force and our support teams for another strong quarter. This morning, I'll update you on our two core customer strategies. Through our Commercial acceleration strategy, we continue to gain significant market share during the second quarter, demonstrating that our strategy, focus on our customers and our Team Members  is continuing to gain traction. With a large Commercial market and our low 3% market share, there continues to be plenty of room for continued growth. This was our sixth consecutive quarter of double- digit growth in Commercial with a 14.8% increase in comp store sales for the quarter, on top of a 13.5% comp increase during the second quarter of last year. This is the second quarter that our Commercial sales mix, as a percent of our total sales was over 30%. We continue to drive towards our goal of a 50% Commercial business mix. Our Commercial gross profit rate again improved as a result of increased mix of parts sales, and our continued implementation of our value proposition based on customer service. We remain confident in our efforts to aggressively grow the Commercial business and we continue to drive towards double-digit comps for the remainder of the year. In the last few quarters, we've discussed our focus areas that are leading our acceleration in our Commercial business. We're continuing to make progress in these focus areas. Investing in additional parts pros, trucks, drivers and upgraded inventories in our stores and our markets where we have the greatest potential. These investments provide our stores the capacity to grow faster and our largest comp growth is coming from this market. We continue to build on the basics of great customer service at each store through Commercial operations initiatives, focused on answering the phone quickly, filling the order quickly and consistently making timely deliveries to our customers. Additionally, we are revolutionizing our Commercial sales force by adding Commercial account managers, once we have the additional store investments in place and we're ready to execute our value proposition. We continue to build on our database and customer acquisition capabilities that tells us to acquire new customers, while increasing our share of existing customer purchases. These capabilities have been critical to focusing our team on where the greatest potential is and identifying more garage customers. Since we launched our Commercial acceleration strategy, our growing number of independent garages and national chains have placed their trust in Advance Auto Parts. We want these customers to view Advance as a value-business partner that enables their success by simplifying the running of their business. Because of these, our Commercial customers have rewarded us with strong sales. In recognition of this success, we recently celebrated commercial customer appreciation week. So we had the pleasure, along with our entire management team, to ride with Commercial account managers and district Commercial customers across the country, and personally say thanks for their business. In addition, our regional vice presidents, district managers and general managers also visited customers throughout the week. All total, we visited with more than 15,000 of our customers. During each visit, we discussed the customers needs and learned how we can serve them better. This learnings will help us to continue to grow our Commercial business. We'd like to thank our many team members that helped to organize and execute this successful and important event, and again, thank our customers for their business. The Autopart International team turned in another strong performance with a comp store sales increase of 12.4% for the second quarter. AI continues to expand its business rapidly through both strong, organic growth and new store openings. We recently opened our second AI store in the same building as an existing Advance store. We plan to continue to experiment with this model, allowing us to better meet our customers needs by increasing our parts availability, while leveraging our occupancy cost. We are very pleased with the AI team year-to-date increase in both revenue and profits, and we continue to see AI as a key driver of our future growth. Now, turning to our DIY transformation. We achieved our second consecutive quarter of positive comp. Our team delivered 0.7% positive comp increase during the second quarter. As you may recall, the comp sales decrease of 0.8% in the second quarter last year was our strongest quarter of the year. Looking at our comps on a two-year basis, our DIY comps were flat consistent with our first quarter after adjusting for the calendar shifts. With that said, the results in the second quarter remind us that we still have much work to do to achieve our goal of solid and consistent DIY comp sales increases every quarter. We believe our industry as a whole, has continued to realize better DIY results from increased traffic as consumers are saving money by maintaining their existing vehicles rather than replacing it. This is reflected in our positive comps as compared to last year. Although the industry data indicates that we maintained DIY market share for the first half of 2009, we saw the industry grow slightly faster than us during the second quarter. We have a several DIY initiatives that are underway to drive our conversion rates with existing customers, as well as increase the consideration rate of potential customers. I want to touch on just a few of those initiatives. With regards to conversion rates, we know we still have a tremendous opportunity in DIY to fulfill the needs of the customers, who are already visiting or calling our stores each day. In our business, almost all of our customers come to our stores with a specific need are seeking of solution to their problem. They want to make a purchase. We're installing traffic counters and updated phone systems in stores to actually measure customer demand, which will help us provide better customer service and improve our conversion rate by store. To improve our ability to better solve our customers problems, we are targeting stores with specific R&D efforts identified sales development opportunities. We're also creating intuitiveclusters of store based on location, customer make up and competition, to get more targeted and impactful with our initiatives. Lastly, we're working on opportunities to better leverage the parts availability and merchandising improvements we're making to our stores. In regards to consideration rate, we're testing changes and refinements to our marketing plan, including localized marketing, where we'll address the need that are tailored to each market by assessing our current market share, the customer base and the competitive landscape. All of these initiatives are built on a more focused brand purpose that creates differentiation around the superior customer experience for both our DIY and Commercial customers. As we discussed last quarter, we have a monthly companywide customer satisfaction survey that allows us to measure our progress on building a superior customer experience. We're listening closely to what our customers are saying and how they rate our performance. As you've heard, we are measuring satisfaction at every store across the chain. These stores are continuing to increase and are key measures that will help us determine how we evolve our value proposition and move it forward. As more of our customers continue to keep their cars longer, our core value of serving our customers better than anyone else, is more important than ever. Switching to new store developments, during the second quarter, we opened 23 stores, including seven by Autopart International. We also closed 21 stores and relocated three. Year-to-date, we've opened a total of 69 stores including 18 by AI, which continues on a path towards our goal of 75 new Advance stores and 30 AI stores in 2009. Year-to-date, we've also closed 30 stores and relocated six. Our total store count at the end of the quarter was 3,407, including 142 AI stores. Mike will share more information about the store closing that are part of our plan we announced during our the fourth release, as well as their financial impact. In closing, thanks again to our team for what each of you are doing each day to serve our customers and drive our results. We continue to believe we are making solid progress in providing both our Commercial and DIY customers a superior experience, and look forward to keeping you updated as we continue with our initiatives. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin, to review our Availability Excellence and Superior Experience strategies. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I would also like to congratulate the team on a great quarter. I'll briefly highlight our initiatives that improved our gross profit rates, as well as key focus areas and investments that will continue to drive long-term value. During the second quarter, our gross profit rates increased 189 basis points versus last year. The 189 point improvement was primarily due to continued investments and pricing capabilities, merchandising capabilities, a decrease in inventory shrink and better store execution resulting from our changes to better align Team Member incentives. We continue to roll out our new price optimization process, which favorably impacted our gross profit rates in the quarter. Our retail price optimization strategy has been implemented across the majority of the front room categories. This was achieved while simultaneously improving our price competitiveness against our major competitors. We will complete our back room optimization test in the fourth quarter. We continue to move quickly to develop a true, direct importing program and believe our opportunities in this area are great. Our Asian sourcing operation has been stamped and we expect this capability to provide a significant margin improvement and allow us to increase our speed to market with products that are aligned with what our customers want and need. We are rebuilding our order management process to ensure smooth integration of new import sourcing and are finalizing a trade finance program for import ordering. Our initial orders will arrive next month and we expect the program to grow substantially over the next several years. Through the outsourcing of our corporate purchasing and expense account payable function, we have identified significant savings that will strengthen our bottom line performance. Although some of the benefits are capitalized or realized over multiple years, we expect the benefits to offset transition expenses indeed this year. However, we expect to drive significant benefits in 2010 and beyond. Next, I'd like to update you on the progress of our availability excellence strategy. availability excellence enabled us to serve our customers better than anyone else by redefining the standards with breadth, depth and speed of delivery of parts. During the quarter, we had a two speedy queue or parts delivered quickly warehouses and 24 hub stores for the larger footprint than any standard Advance store. A hub store stocks a wider variety and greater supply of inventory, allowing the hub store to supplement the inventory of other Advance stores in its immediate market. We also increased store delivery services to provide a wider assortment of parts for our customers. These facilities, combined with the added delivery service, increases our ability to provide parts to our stores within two hours or less. In concert with our new custom mix capability, a record-setting 466 inventory upgrades occurred during the quarter. We're establishing the standard for availability in our industry. We were also able to re-assort 22% of our planograms, parts planograms using our new custom mix tools, bringing the total re-assortment of 36% of our parts, year-to-date. We continue to work aggressively to remove overstocks of unproductive inventory from our store assortments and adding products with proven demand in that locale. In Q4 of 2008, we announced a significant change on how we manage slow-moving inventory. During the quarter, approximately $20 million of slow-moving inventory we disposed of, bringing the total to $26 million year-to-date. Our goal is to dispose the remaining $11 million by the end of the year. This will not have any impact on our 2009 financials, since we are utilizing the inventory reserve recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008. The combination of strong gross margin improvements, sales increases and a reduction in inventory led to a solid increase in gross margin return on inventory. I'd like to congratulate the merchandising team on this exceptional performance on the company's largest financial asset. In addition, to the availability excellence investments, we continue to identify opportunity to drive efficiencies to our supply chains and logistics functions. During the quarter, we implemented engineered standards for order selections within two of our eight distribution centers, bringing to a total of six, year- to-date. This initiative enables us to improve labor productivity in our main distribution centers and reduce distribution expenses substantially in the quarter. We're also on track to deliver the expected financial savings in the outsourcing of our fleet for outbound transportation. Turning to information technology, we are continuing to invest in IT in support of our business strategy. Last quarter, we launched an online inventory look-up site and began building a team of experienced e- Commerce professionals. With the strides that we made so far, we are on track for the BTC or business-to- consumer site to go live in Q4 of this year, and the business-to-business site to go live in early 2010. Another initiative we have underway is the implementation of our core merchandising system. I'm pleased with our progress so far. We are currently on track for our initial implementation to begin in the second half of 2009 and to be completed in early 2010. As previously stated, we anticipate we will begin to realize the benefits of the new system and begin to see improved category performance as a result of these new investments. Next, I'd like to update you on our superior experience strategy. superior experience enables us to serve our customers better than anyone else, by consistently providing legendary customer service through our relentless focus on execution. Superior experience translates that goal into specific activities that our team members must perform in order to unlock their full potential, drive significant customer satisfaction improvement, while ultimately, accelerating profitable sales growth. We have launched a new initiative called the implementation factory, which will establish a new standard of excellence by providing training and coaching programs for specific initiatives that have broad yield impact. The implementation factory began their journey in Q2 by rolling out the first initiatives, including new battery warranty procedures, disciplined Commercial pricing and improved strength controls. We look forward to sharing results from this exciting initiative in future quarters. Additionally, the implementation factory will rollout initiatives that have been fully tested. While the ultimate destination of this test will be our stores, they will be sponsored by various functions throughout the company. We have many tests underway to improve our conversion rate, enhance our labor scheduling, optimize full pricing and localized assortment. These tests with their greatest overall impact, will be prioritized for the fastest deployment through the implementation factory. In closing, I continue to be encouraged with the progress we're making, as a result of our investments in availability excellence and superior experience strategies. Now, let me turn the call over to Mike to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for the results we achieved this quarter. Despite being up against a challenging comparison from second quarter last year, due to the positive impact of the economic stimulus, our team again delivered a strong financial quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights of our 2009 second quarter; two, share with you the progress we are making on the key financial dimensions of our transformation around growth, profit and value creation, and three, share what we see for the balance of the year. Overall, we were pleased with our second quarter financial results that were primarily driven by the 189 basis point increase in our gross profit rate versus prior year, as a result of our continued strategic investments. Our comp store sales increase to 4.8% was in line with our expectations and consistent with our first quarter comp store sales performance on a two-year basis, after adjusting for the approximate 100 basis points impact of the calendar shift. Our second quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.83 included $0.06 related to store divestitures. Excluding the impact of the store divestitures, our earnings per share of $0.89 versus the consensus of $0.83, increased 14% on top of a 22% increase in EPS last year. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share increased 17% on top of the 21% increase in EPS last year, excluding the $0.10 impact of store divestitures. Some highlights of the quarter include a 4.8% comp store sales increase, comprised of a 14.8% increase in Commercial and 0.7% increase in DIY. Our Commercial comp was comprised of 15.2% increase at Advance stores and a 12.4% increase from Autopart International. All in, our revenue during the quarter grew at 7% versus the remainder of the total market growth of approximately 3%. Clearly, our solid top line performance resulted in market share gains. During the second quarter, our gross profit rate increased 189 basis points versus last year, primarily due to the continued investments in pricing capabilities, merchandising capabilities, parts availability, decreased inventory shrink and better store execution resulting from the impact of the previous changes to better align team member incentives. We are realizing the benefits from the investments we've made over the past year, in terms of both our pricing and merchandising capabilities, as well as decreased inventory shrink. These new capabilities are allowing us to be more targeted with respect to our Commercial and retail pricing strategies and better position from a cost standpoint. Additionally, our store team members continue to respond remarkably to our new incentive structure. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our 158 basis point year-to-date increase in gross profit rate. During the second quarter, our SG&A rate increased 136 basis points, excluding the impact of store divestitures. The 136 basis point increase was driven by higher incentive compensation, higher mix of fixed Commercial labor, continued strategic capability investments to improve the company's gross profit rate and accelerate the Commercial business and increased medical expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising expenses and occupancy expense leverage as a result of our 4.8% comp store sales increase. All in, our operating margin increased 53 basis points during the second quarter after removing the impact of the incremental store divestitures. We have previously shared that 2009 would be another year marked by investments, required as part of our turn around and transformation. This continued to manifest itself in our second quarter and first half SG&A rate. Free cash flow through the second quarter was $287 million or an 18% increase over prior-year's first two quarters, primarily driven by an increase in operating income. With this free cash flow, we have decreased our total bank debt outstanding by $173 million over the past year. Our accounts-payables-to-inventory ratio decreased to 58.4% from 61.6% at the end of the second quarter last year, primarily driven by the impact of the Mood & Wagner inventory build up at the end of the second quarter of 2008. We expect that this is strictly a timing impact and we remain on track to improve our AP ratio this year. As proof of our improved inventory management, our inventory actually decreased 3% over last year, even though our sales were 7%. Our rent adjusted leverage ratio at the end of second quarter was 2.4x, which was in line with our internal target. From a capital structure perspective, we continue to manage the business to a maximum adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of 2.5x using 6x capitalized rent. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 345,000 shares of stocks for $14.4 million at an average share price of $41.71. While we may be opportunistic with some share repurchases, we remain committed to managing to our rent adjusted leverage ratio of 2.5x. To put our second quarter financial results in perspective, we are pleased with our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit Commercial comp sales growth, our second consecutive positive DIY comp in over three years, as well as the strong gross profit rate improvement, which fueled our strong earnings growth. We are pleased with the year-to-date cash flow we generated and the fact that we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. While 11% SG&A dollar growth, excluding store divestitures, is not what we are striving for longer-term, we believe we are investing in the right parts of our business that will drive long-term value. Given the ramp up of SG&A investments that begun during the second half of 2008, we would expect that SG&A dollar growth will moderate as we progress through the remainder of 2009. Now, I'd like to share with you the progress we are making on the key financial dimensions of our transformation around growth, profit and value creation, as measured by our four gauges. As we have shared, our strategic investments are being made to accelerate our growth, improve our profitability and increase the value of our company. Turning to growth, we have targeted a significant portion of our spending into the customer-facing parts of our business. This represents our largest driver of SG&A dollar growth from last year and includes more trucks, drivers, parts pros, sales force, inventory upgrades and tools, which are translating directly into sales growth for our company, as evidenced by our sixth consecutive quarters of double-digit Commercial comps and our market share gains. Another area of spending that is fueling our growth is the structural changes we made to our field incentive programs that pay on growth rather than budget. Although on a year-to-date basis, we are deleveraging SG&A as a result of higher incentive comp, our bonus expense, as a percentage of incremental gross profit dollar, is approximately 700 basis points lower on a year-to-date basis versus 2008 for the same period. Said simply, we are getting a higher return on the incentive dollars we are spending. This program is also translating into changed behaviors as evidenced by the approximately 73% of our stores with comp store sales gains on year-to-date basis versus less than 60% last year for the same period. Looking forward, we continue to see growth potential as we look to build on our modest 3% share in Commercial market. Turning to profit, we continue to make significant strategic investments in our availability excellence and superior experienced strategies. This includes investments in merchandising capabilities and systems, global sourcing, supply chain capabilities and networks, margins drainer improvements, e-Commerce and better store execution. These investments has translated into the 189 basis point margin improvement we delivered in our second quarter. What is also compelling,is we are as price competitive as we have ever been, yet we are still in the early stages of what we think the potential of these investments can deliver. While we are seeing significant deleverage on our SG&A line from these investments given we are in the heaviest investment cycle, we are encouraged that our operating margin continues to grow as evidenced by our 53 basis point increase during our second quarter. An area of opportunity we have to improve our profitability is narrowing the high degree of variability we see today in many of our performance metrics across our store base. We see the implementation factory as a new capability that will help us improve this variability and consistency in performance. When you combine the potential improvements driven by more consistent execution with the growth potential in commercial and the margin benefits still to be realized, our future profit model looks promising. In addition to the progress we are making in growth and profit, we are also focused on value creation. This includes more rigorous around capital deployment, working capital management and cash flows. On a comparable year-to-date basis, ROIC has increased to 14.9% from 14.3% during the same period last year. This increase reflects a sharper focus on the investments we are making relative to the returns generated. To illustrate, inventory actually decreased from last year's second quarter by 3% compared to sales growth of 7%. This is the direct result of our decision last year to remove non-working inventory and replace it with more productive inventory that better meets customer needs. These activities are all contributing to us building a strong financial platform to grow from and have us on the pathway to investment grade as evidenced by the recent outlook upgrades by both S&P and Moody's. We are particularly proud of these outlook upgrades as they reflected independent assessment validating our improved operational performance, strong liquidity, solid operating cash flows and strong financial metrics. While we are making progress in the areas of financial value, we also see many opportunities ahead such as supply chain financing, occupancy cost reductions, store purchases and continued inventory management improvements that will further improve our financial strength. Looking ahead, we continue to be optimistic in our growth and profitability profile based on our second quarter results, and we remain committed to our strategic objectives and investment profile. I would like to also remind you that the impact of the calendar shift that we benefited from in Q1 will begin to reverse and create a modest headwind to our comp store sales in Q3 and Q4. In addition, as previously shared, we will increase our investment spending in key strategic areas in the back half of 2009 including commercial trucks, parts pros and drivers, as well as in new capability areas such as global sourcing, e- Commerce and our implementation factory. We will also be opportunistic with some store location purchases which will modestly increase our capital expenditure spending from our previous outlook. Our proven results coupled with our low commercial market share demand that we move faster. We still expect each 1% in comp store sales will add approximately $0.05 in EPS on an annual basis and a 10 basis point change in operating margin is still expected to add approximately $0.03 of EPS. These sensitivities do not include our store divestiture costs. In closing, we are pleased with the financial results we delivered this quarter and in the first half of 2009. They contain clues that we are on the right pathway to reach our full potential and are also a reminder that we are still in the investment cycle of our transformation. Most importantly, we are proud of our dedicated team members who delivered fantastic second quarter results and who are passionately leading our transformation. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now, let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our CEO. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 51,000 Team Members for delivering a record performance in our second quarter of 2010. The team continues to position us for another great year with strong top line and bottom line results through their focus on execution and an unwavering commitment to serving our customers. We remain confident in our Team Members and our strategies as they fuel the 6.9% increase in our year-to-date comp store sales. Our team continues to drive the resurgence of our DIY business, while extending the string of double-digit comp store sales gains in our Commercial business. The favorable market conditions and successful execution of our key initiatives drove a 7.2% increase of total sales and a record store sales productivity that reached $1.64 million per store on a trailing four quarter basis. Our Availability Excellence teams continue to shine by expanding our gross profit rate by over 100 basis points, resulting in double-digit operating income growth during the quarter. The 12% operating margins are a glimpse in the potential of our overall business. I'm encouraged by our continued improvement and our overall customer satisfaction scores, achieved while delivering a record 16.5% return on invested capital. Collectively, the strategic and financial progress is evident in our customer experience and our bottom-line results. Similar to the first quarter, we outperformed both our financial and strategic objectives during the second quarter of 2010. We are pleased with the continued progress of the initiatives that we have previously shared with you. Jim, Kevin and Mike will provide updates on some of these initiatives later in the call. Our team is the most important factor to advance this success. All highly engaged Team Members have a passion for serving our customers and are committed to serving our customers better than anyone else. We continue to assess the engagement of our teams through our team calibration survey, and I am encouraged that those scores continue to increase across the company. Clearly, we are moving in the right direction. The economic landscape and our industry vital signs, such as more stable gas prices and miles driven, along with the increase in average age of vehicles, continue to be favorable and have fueled our market over the first half of the year. These dynamics, combined with our continued focus on select initiatives, are helping us deliver strong results. Yet we are also aware that we will compete with back-to-school and the holiday shopping season for top spots on our customers' priority list in the back half of the year. Overall, we are encouraged by our good start to the third quarter and are upbeat as we look to the second half of 2010. Our focus in the second half will remain on key initiatives, including demand-driven labor, the roll out of our B2B website, our Commercial customer growth and retention program, our B2C website and global sourcing. These initiatives continue to make a difference with our customers and to our bottom line. Our confidence is tempered by the fact that our business has benefited from extremely favorable weather conditions in the first half of 2010. However, weather tends to even out over the course of the year. Additionally, consumer priorities will have an understandable impact, principally in Q4, due to the holiday shopping season. I'd like to take a moment to recognize some members of our team who are driving great outcomes. Through the second quarter, our biggest improvement has come from our 42% increase in free cash flow, which rose to $407.6 million, a record cash flow along with work on our owned inventory management, are examples how leaders are working hard to transform our business. Leaders such as Kevin Quinn, our Vice President of Treasury; Jamie Akemann, our Vice President of Merchandise; Jim North, our Vice President of Inventory Management; and Team Members like Navdeep Gupta, John Lammers and Jim Fannin worked diligently to make these goals become a reality. The work of this cross-cultural team affected all areas of the business and you will see benefits of this work for a very long time to come. This type of work is a testament of the success of Advance's transformation. And it wouldn't be possible without the commitment of these talented and dedicated Team Members. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade metrics and would like to congratulate this dedicated group on the work that they are continuing to do to make this happen. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to provide a progress update on our Commercial Acceleration and DIY transformation strategies. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I want to add my congratulations and thanks to our store team, our sales force and our store support team for another strong quarter. Our team continues to serve our customers through our company values and we thank our customers for entrusting us with a their vehicle needs. This quarter was a continuation of the plans we've laid out before in the past few quarters. Our team continues to execute our plan very successfully. In addition, as Darren mentioned, our industry fundamentals remain strong. These fundamentals are positive to our business and we believe they will remain positive in the future. This includes the increase in average age of vehicles, more vehicles entering our industry sweet spot, dealer closings and more consumers who need to repair their own vehicles. Our total comp store sales grew by 5.8% in the second quarter compared to 4.8% during the same quarter last year. Again this quarter, we achieved an increase in both the number of customer transactions, as well as the average size of each of those transactions. Each of our geographic areas produced positive comps in DIY and double-digit comps in Commercial. This marks our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit Commercial comps in our Advance Auto Parts stores. Commercial now represents 34% of our total sales. Also we saw solid growth in our DIY business and achieved our fifth quarter of positive DIY comps in the last six quarters. We continue to gain market share during the quarter. We are continuing to focus on the initiatives that we previously described for both Commercial and DIY. Our pace of new initiatives is slowing, and we're focused on fully implementing and executing the initiatives that we have rolled out. This focus is enabling more consistent sales growth, while slowing our level of investment. Our team is focused on leading through our values and measuring their success with clear goals, and we're proud of their progress. In terms of initiatives, we remain on schedule with those things that allow us to serve our customers best. This focus has produced our strong sales results and the highest sales per store in our industry. We have completed Commercial investments in half our stores with Commercial programs. Those investments are continuing to fuel our Commercial growth in 2010 as we look towards extending these investments in the entire chain over the next couple of years. At the same time, we're using what we've learned from those stores and are applying much of it across our entire chain. Our investments in parts availability continue to benefit both our DIY and Commercial business as we're getting better every quarter in having the parts our customers need when they need them. We continue to use our Commercial customer data as a base from which to develop stronger and deeper relationships with our best customers with the highest potential for growth. This will be an ongoing focus and will be key to our growth and customer retention, as well as continuing to increase the productivity of our investments in the Commercial business. To ensure our Commercial DIY customers have Team Members available when needed, we've implemented the two phases of our customer-driven staffing model. We'll continue to increase our staffing effectiveness as we build on this model. To ensure our store teams have the knowledge and skills needed to help solve our customers' problems, we've increased the quality and effectiveness of our training and development programs for our Team Members. This includes our onboarding programs for new hires, product knowledge and related problem-solving skills and customer greeting and sales training for all Team Members. In the past year, Kevin's team has launched new capabilities in e-commerce that are also benefiting our sales growth. In DIY, e-commerce is increasing our sales and providing our customers the tools to do research before coming to the store. Our Commercial customers are rapidly signing up to use B2B as a tool to facilitate their ordering process. Kevin will take you further on these initiatives. We continue to refine our marketing approach to better target both our highest potential customers and our underserved customer segments. This new, more targeted approach has allowed us to more than double our marketing effectiveness, while keeping our overall marketing spend roughly in line with last year. We're very pleased with the returns in the progress of our marketing initiatives. In addition to sales growth, we are pleased that our customer satisfaction scores have continued to improve in 2010. We are focusing on those stores where our customers have given us our lowest customer satisfaction ratings. As we build a stronger Advance Auto Parts brand every store must provide exceptional service consistently. With these initiatives, the positive industry fundamentals and the positive feedback from our customers, we're excited about our ability to achieve double-digit growth in our Commercial business and grow our DIY business as we look forward. Lastly, we're also reaching new customers and growing our sales through successful new store openings. During the second quarter, we opened 36 stores, including 14 Autopart International stores, while closing one store. As of the end of the second quarter, our total store count was 3,497, including 181 Autopart International stores. Additionally in the first week of the third quarter, we opened our 3,500th store in Westerly, Rhode Island, marking another significant milestone in our growth story. In closing, thanks again to our team for another successful quarter, and for achieving those results with commitment to leading entire teams and providing great customer service. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd also like to congratulate the team for a strong second quarter. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our a accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to strengthen our gross profit rate and improved product availability. During the second quarter, our gross profit rate increased 111 basis points versus the same quarter last year. The second quarter improvement was driven by increases both in front room and back room categories, resulting from the rollout of our custom mix and price optimization strategies. The strengthening of our merchandising capabilities and the impact of our rapidly growing global sourcing capabilities, we continue to be pleased with the strides that we've made in improving our gross profit rate, which has increased over 300 basis points on a two-year basis. Through our custom mix rollout, we've completed approximately 180 inventory upgrades during the quarter. This strategy allows us to improve our end market availability of parts and accessories and drives improvement both in sales lift and margin performance. As a result of our improved availability, the sale of Hard Parts continued to outpace that of our company average and is increasing as a percent of total revenue versus the second quarter of last year. This increase in sales mix for Hard Parts and improvement in its category margin rate were strong contributors to the 111-basis-point expansion in total gross profit rate. Additionally, we continue to grow sales and expand our margins in accessories, which have benefited greatly from our new global sourcing capability. In total, global sourcing had a positive impact on gross margin in the second quarter, and we expect the global sourcing benefits will grow over time to become a material driver of our gross margin performance in 2011 and beyond. Our adjusted accounts payable to inventory ratio of 72.1% is at an all-time high and compares to 58.4% at the end of second quarter last year. This significant achievement was primarily driven by more favorable payment terms and the timing of inventory purchases. We're on pace to achieve our long-term goal and expect to see continued year-over-year improvement in 2010. The combination of substantially higher margins and significantly lower owned inventory give us the opportunity to increase sales through improved inventory availability. While owned inventory declined, total inventory rose in the quarter. This resulted in an all-time high and our customer perception of product availability. In the second quarter, we continue to make significant progress in increasing our availability through the addition of seven HUB stores. Our delivery HUB network is at 172, providing multiple deliveries a day to southeast stores in addition to our 29 PDQs. We have driven double-digit productivity improvement year- to-date from our engineered standards in the distribution centers on top of a double-digit improvement last year. We're integrating our Southeastern AI supply chain into our Lakeland distribution center and fully intend to use this as a springboard to supply chain integration nationwide. We continue to be pleased with our progress for our DIY e-commerce business and continue increases in all key metrics: traffic, conversion rates, sales. As stated last quarter, the DIY e-commerce business is materially contributing to the fiscal year 2010 performance. We were very pleased with our launch of our extended MyGarage during the DIY site during the quarter. This new feature site aims to help customers maintain vehicle information in one place. Consumers can register one or more vehicles, and keep track of service work, receive recall notices and e-mail alerts when the car needs tune-ups, brakes, tire rotation, tire replacement. These free enhancements are giving our customers even more reasons to shop online with Advance Auto Parts and to visit us more often. On our last call, we discussed the launch of our B2B e-commerce capabilities in December. Based on a successful pilot program, we have moved to full-scale rollout of the B2B e-commerce and currently have over 850 stores and thousands of customers using the system successfully. The system has been well received by our customers, and we see a lift in sales with customers who are on the system. The store and customer count is growing weekly as we roll out nationally. In the second quarter, AI's revenue grew 14.8%, driven by the net addition of 39 new stores over the past 12 months and a positive comp sales performance. AI opened 14 new stores in the quarter, turning their total store count to 181. Overall, the second quarter was very successful for our team, and I'm thrilled by the strategic and financial progress we've made to our availability, excellent strategy. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated Team Members for the strategic progress and fantastic financial results we delivered during the second quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights of our second quarter performance; two, provide an update on the key financial dimensions of our transformation; and three, link our second quarter performance to the balance of 2010. As you may recall, our fiscal 2009 results included the impact of store divestitures, which decreased diluted EPS by $0.06 during the second quarter last year. But we'll speak about our year-over-year results versus 2009 on a comparable operating basis, excluding the impact of the 2009 store divestitures, as that provides a more transparent and relevant comparison. We've provided GAAP financial results as well as comparable operating results in our earnings release. Overall, we are pleased with our strong second quarter performance, which built on the momentum from our first quarter. Our second quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.16 were $0.27 favorable to last year, representing a 30% increase in EPS, excluding the $0.06 impact of store divestitures. This was on top of last year's 14% EPS increase. On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 40% or $0.33 over 2009 second quarter results. Some highlights for the second quarter include a 5.8% comp store sales increase fueled by strong DIY performance and our 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit gains in Commercial. This was on top of a 4.8% comp during the same period last year, representing a 10.6% two-year comp store sales increase. During the second quarter, our gross profit rate increased 111 basis points versus last year, primarily driven by improved merchandising and pricing capabilities, increased inventory levels and results in supply chain efficiencies and improved parts availability. The 111-basis-point increase was on top of 189-basis- point gross profit rate improvement during the second quarter of 2009. Our SG&A rate during the quarter decreased 10 basis points, excluding the impact of store divestitures last year, which exceeded our expectations. The 10-basis-point decrease was driven by strong comparable store sales, which resulted in leverage of occupancy cost and a decelerated pace of incremental spending on the company's strategic capabilities. We are pleased with the progress we have made the balance grow while positioning the company's leverage expenses at lower comp sales levels. After adjusting for higher variable expenses as a result of the better-than-expected comp store sales growth and the favorable timing of SG&A spend during the quarter, our SG&A dollar growth continues to be in line with our expectations and our previously shared annual outlook. Free cash flow through the second quarter was $407.6 million, representing a 42% increase over the same period last year, primarily driven by our strong operating performance and reduction in our owned inventory. Our accounts payable inventory ratio increased to a record 72.1% from 58.4% last year as a result of our continued focused efforts to reduce our owned inventory. Our rent adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 2.2x, which is in line with our internal target and consistent with our financial policy. Our return on invested capital was 16.5%, representing 160-basis-point increase versus last year. Our performance through our second quarter, as well as our performance over the past two and a half years, reinforces our commitment to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value. We will continue to measure our performance based on these three dimensions, and our progress thus far shows we're on the right path. Turning to growth. We continue to make strides in increasing our productivity. This is reflected in our 4% growth in our industry-leading sales per store now at $1.64 million and a 4% increase in sales per square foot on a trailing four-quarter basis through our second quarter. Our ability to grow our profitability is marked by continued gross profit expansion and an increase in operating income rate, which grew 111 basis points and 121 basis points, respectively, during the quarter. Our gross profit rate expanded 300 basis points on a two-year basis and significantly contributed to our second quarter operating margin rate of 12.1%. Our strategic choices, along with our execution and favorable industry dynamics, fueled our growth and profitability in our second quarter, and we continue to expect operating income expansion through improvements in our gross profit rate and more moderate SG&A dollar growth. As we look at our ability to create value, we are pleased with our year-to-date free cash flow and the improvement in our balance sheet, primarily due to a reduction in our owned inventory of $126.2 million. Additionally, our disciplined approach to capital management is generating strong incremental returns on our investments as reflected in our 160-basis-point improvement in our ROIC versus last year. Over the past two years, we have been focused on building an integrated service model and investing in our capabilities and team members in order to fuel our growth and generate both strong operating performance and strong financial returns. Our progress on these dimensions was recognized in April when S&P upgraded our credit rating to investment-grade status. We recently moved another step closer to achieving full investment-grade status as Moody's formally announced they're reviewing for us upgrade. This announcement by Moody's is a direct result of the positive impact our Team Members are making on growing our business. And I want to personally thank all of our Team Members for moving us much closer to a historic milestone for our company. In fact, it is the confidence in our Team Members and their ability to drive continued growth, along with our strong free cash flow that led us to repurchase approximately 3.4 million shares of stock in our second quarter, or 4% of our shares outstanding, for $167.8 million at an average share price of $49.83. Through second quarter, we have repurchased approximately 10.3 million shares at an average share price of $44.31. We were very aggressive in buying back our stock as a result of our relatively low valuation and our internal confidence in our company's ability to grow profitably and to create long-term shareholder value. As we have stated in our press release, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program. The new authorization replaces the previous $500 million share repurchase program that was authorized in February 2010, which had approximately $45 million remaining. We remain committed to managing our rent adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio to a maximum 2.5x using 6x capitalized rent. Next, I'd like to link our second quarter performance to what we see for the balance of the year. We continue to be on track to open approximately 150 new Advance and Auto Part International stores, and we remain committed to our previously communicated investment profile. We are very pleased with our first half performance and have momentum going into the back half of fiscal 2010, given our industry dynamics, previous investments and confidence in our team's execution. That said, we do not expect the same level of over performance that we delivered in the first half, given the seasonality of our business is clearly more heavily weighted towards the first half, and the reality is our back half volume is historically more challenging and volatile as consumer mixed trade-offs with respect to back-to-school and the holiday shopping season. We also estimate our SG&A will run slightly higher than we planned in the back half due to spending, which was anticipated to occur in our second quarter, and due to expenses driven by our higher than anticipated first half performance. As we have shared previously, our practice is not to update our annual outlook unless there is a material factor or factors impacting that annual outlook. As a result of our first half performance, which exceeded our internal expectations, combined with our significant share repurchase activity which was not included in our original annual EPS outlook, we believe it is prudent to reflect these material changes and update our previously communicated annual EPS outlook. We now estimate our fiscal 2010 annual EPS outlook to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. In closing, we are pleased with our strong second quarter financial performance that was driven by our previous strategic investments, fantastic Team Member execution and positive industry dynamics. These factors contributed to our delivering strong top line and bottom line growth, along with record cash flow and returns as measured by return on invested capital. Our share repurchases through the second quarter reflect our confidence in our company's ability to drive further value and we remain committed to driving growth, profitability and continued shareholder returns through investing in our Team Members and inspiring them to serve our customers better than anyone else. Again, I would like to thank all of our talented Team Members for their meaningful contributions, which drove our second quarter performance and who continue to help our company reach new heights. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

For planning purposes, our third quarter earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, November 9, 2011, after market close. And our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, November 10, 2011. To be notified of dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Second Quarter Conference Call. I'd like to thank our 52,000 Advance team members for delivering an outstanding performance in the second quarter through their dedication and service to our customers. We are pleased with our second quarter results that include our commercial sales growing at double-digit comp rates and our DIY business showing incremental improvements from our first quarter, both combined to generate a 2.5% comparable store sales gain in the quarter. Our external measures for customer satisfaction continued their upward trends for both our commercial and DIY businesses. Collectively, our service and operations focus is reflected in our 66-basis point improvement and our operating income rate, which rose to 12.8% for the quarter, as well as our earnings per share, which grew 26% to $1.46 during the quarter. These results are very encouraging despite a consumer environment filled with economic uncertainty. Our expectations reflect the current reality of the more challenging economic landscape, including escalating gas prices that are over $1 per gallon higher than a year ago, miles driven trending downward and a clear slowdown in the industry growth rate versus the record pace last year. The counter balance to the economic pressure is the continued aging of the vehicle fleet, which stands at 10.5 years, lower new car sales and pent-up deferred maintenance cost that have more than offset the economic obstacles. It is important to say our teams have done a terrific job retooling our operations and financial plans without compromising our strategic investments which has allowed us to be successful in the current economic environment. Our ability to balance solid execution in the short term, with our efforts to evolve our operating model to differentiate in the long term, is a delicate one, especially when the strategic and financial commitments are to achieve record levels. Our team is on track to deliver both. Strategically, we remain committed to accelerating the Commercial business through our wave rollout process, building world-class capabilities including global servicing and pricing, aggressively expanding our E-commerce platform for both B2C and B2B, strengthening our distribution capabilities in providing the best-in-market availability through our public expansions and custom mix rollout and igniting our promise ""Service is our best part."" Financially, we are on track to grow our commercial comp store sales by double digits for the fourth year in a row. Our 240-basis point improvement in our operating income rate and 420-basis point improvement in our ROIC over the past 3 years reflects the strength of the industry, but more directly, the systematic approach and determination of the Advance team. Looking at the balance of the year, I am pleased with our start to the third quarter. Yet I remain cautious for the reasons I mentioned earlier regarding the economic stress coupled with the record comparisons to last year. That being said, my confidence in our teams' ability to deliver on expectations through excellent customer service while controlling our costs are high. Strategically, we will continue to prioritize service leadership through accelerating our commercial growth by investing in talented team members with a passion to serve. And we expect to benefit from delivery in B2B capabilities that will allow us to fulfill our customers' needs with speed, reliability and consistency. Leading in service also means growing our DIY business by ensuring we have a foundational, service and operational excellence at every store. We are committed to igniting service with tools that increase customer engagement, team member productivity while providing a great buying experience. Additionally, we will continue to maintain our focus on providing superior availability. Simply said, our goal is to be the best position to provide our customers the products they both need and want to complete their job. This means continuing to invest in the appropriate breadth and depth of inventory and evolving our supply chain to manage demand effectively and efficiently. Superior availability will continue to leverage our merchandise capabilities and extensive in-market supply chain network to ensure we have not only the quantity of products but the quality at the right store at the right time. Our strategic and financial progress will not be linear or spreadsheet perfect. The record results we achieved since 2008 and the winding road to get there reminds us of that. As such, our focus remains on building on the momentum of the past 3 years and positioning our company for long-term sustainable growth and profitability while serving our customers better than anyone else. Our record second quarter results are another positive step in the journey. Before I close, I want to provide an extraordinary example of a team and a team member of Advance Auto Parts that represent ""Service is our best part."" The why customers choose Advance Auto Parts. At the heart of service is great people, Advance Team members. Last month, I traveled to Princeton, Indiana to be with our team at store 5004 which is led by our Store Manager Eric Dunlop [ph] and District Leader, Ernie Lease [ph]. My visit was one of the most difficult and inspiring days that I have had since joining Advance Auto Parts. I was there for the services of Crystal McDuffee [ph], a 23-year-old mobile parts pro that was lost in the line of duty on a routine delivery. Words cannot describe the pain of her loss. I met with customers, families and team members. I was inspired by the care, the joy and the genuine life Crystal radiated to everyone she came in contact with. Eric Dunlop and the greater team surrounded Crystal's family with support, care and compassion. Crystal and the Princeton team are a humble and meaningful reminder that service begins with extraordinary people. Crystal, Eric and Princeton, Indiana are an inspiring reminder that service and our people are the best part. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to discuss our service leadership strategy. Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I'll start again by thanking and congratulating our team for the sales and profit results we are reporting this morning. Their hard work in leading and inspiring our teams and serving their customers better than anyone else produced our improved results for the second quarter. Our total comp store sales grew by 2.5% in the second quarter compared to 5.8% during the same quarter last year. We saw an improvement in both our DIY and Commercial sales trends over the first quarter. Overall, the comp increase was primarily due to an increase in average transaction size. We saw a rebound in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions where we were impacted most by weather in the first quarter. We're encouraged by these results and see many positive signs that we can continue to build on our momentum as we've gotten off to a solid start in the third quarter. The overall market remains mixed but certainly remains positive over the longer term. The vehicle population continues to age and will continue to age for many years to come, as a result of the slowdown of new vehicles coming into the market. The unemployment rate and higher car gas prices are currently challenging consumer spending and driving habits and causing consumers to, again, defer maintenance but that maintenance will eventually have to be done as it has in the past. Our Commercial sales returned to double-digit comps in the second quarter after a very slight dip into single digits in the first quarter. This resumed our record of double-digit comps 13 of the last 14 quarters in our Advance stores. We continue to outperform the market and gain significant market share in this growing business. Commercial represented 37.2% of our total sales in the second quarter. We still see tremendous opportunities to grow Commercial and to gain market share. While we've seen some improvements in DIY, we still have opportunities despite the tough economic environment. We've made changes that will both drive more customers to our stores and better serve them during the second half of the year. In both DIY and Commercial, our sales growth will be driven by our continued emphasis on operational service excellence at every store and by the progress we've made with greater parts availability while leveraging the investments we've made over the last several years, along with selected investments going forward. As a reminder, our focus on operational and service excellence is aligned with our goal of serving our customers with dependable and fast service consistently in every store, everyday. We believe this focus certainly is contributing to our sequential improvement in sales results. Early in the year, we increased the number of district leaders and sales force to enable them to spend more time serving our customers and coaching their teams. This created some short-term disruption as both those teams experienced changes in the stores they led and the customers they serve. That change is now behind us and our team is building momentum. We've shared with you, over the last several quarters, our work to continue to strengthen our store staffing model. Our work has been focused on having the right people at the right time to align with the traffic patterns of both our DIY and Commercial customers and we’re seeing tremendous results from this work. Through our focus on training and development to solve our customers’ problems, we now have the most ASE-certified team members ever in our stores. During the quarter, we saw substantial increases in our measurements that tell us how well we're doing at having the right quantity and quality of staffing coverage each day of the week in each store. And we reached new levels of productivity as well as achieved significant leverage in our labor investment over last year. With these improvements, we are now investing in specific stores and markets, where we see opportunities to accelerate our sales growth. In regard to new store openings during the second quarter, we opened 28 stores and closed 1 store. Year- to-date, we've opened 65 stores. As of the end of our second quarter, our total store count was 3,627 including 203 Autopart International stores. In closing, I'd again like to thank our team as we serve our customers through our promise of ""Service is our best part."" Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss our superior availability strategy. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their hard work in the second quarter. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter as well as update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy. Availability has been a key strategy for us over the past 3 years and is high on the list of what our customers tell us they expect of us. Furthermore, when we have the products our customers want at the store, our customer conversion rates are in excess of 90%. However, when we have to pick up the product somewhere else, resulting in longer delivery times, this drops considerably. Since Q1 of last year we've been aggressively working to forward our position of inventory and the failure in maintenance categories and position ourselves to meet the demands of the customer and lead the industry in availability. As a result, we've worked aggressively to add to our number of hub stores, which sits at 253 today, including 14 that were opened during second quarter and over 77 opened year-to-date. We've also greatly increased the number of inventory upgrades at store level in order to maximize our storage capacity. During the second quarter, we upgraded inventory at 266 stores and 652 year-to-  date. In addition to our efforts to increase the quantity of product availability for our customers since 2008, we've been working aggressively to ensure we have the right brands, quality of parts and the right assortment in the right store. The quality of our offerings has never been better. Our inventory position increased in the second quarter of last year and we ended the second quarter of fiscal 2011 up 15.1%, down from 21.3% increase of inventory in Q1. Our in-stock levels were up 130 basis points over last year, setting a record high. As confirmation of the effectiveness of these investments, an independent industry survey placed Advance at the #1 position for product availability. We believe we can continue to lead in availability with less overall inventory. We anticipate ending the year with inventory levels in the low-double digits above last year and end Q1 of next year with inventory levels below Q1 of this year. Despite the rapid growth in inventory, our own inventory per store decreased 1% due to our work to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which now stands at 75.1%, up roughly 300 basis points from the second quarter of 2010. We continue to make great strides in our efforts to expand this program by working strategically with our vendor partners to form strong and mutually beneficial partnerships. The combination of rapid expansion of this program and the deceleration of our inventory growth should lead to further reductions in our own inventory in the quarters ahead. Turning to gross profit. Our margins declined 72 basis points to an overall rate of 49.7%. This decline was driven by several factors. The first factor was our strong shrink performance of the last 2 years reversed. Jim and his team have been working diligently to prioritize the processes to ensure we get back to our strong levels of asset protection. Additionally, our supply chain costs continue to be a headwind as a result of increased fuel prices and increased HUB deliveries. We were also negatively affected by inflationary pressures during the quarter, combined with an elevated level of price competition in the marketplace. A confirmation of the wisdom of our aggressive price action was an independent industry survey placing Advance in the lead in the perception of DIY prices. Partially offsetting these headwinds were continued improvements in the DC productivity and continued benefits from our merchandising and pricing capabilities. For the balance of the year, we continue to expect our gross profit rate to be constrained driven by increased supply chain expenses relative to higher fuel costs and HUB investments. Additionally, shrink will be a headwind as we work aggressively to get back to our previous levels of performance. And finally, we will balance our price changes in response to high commodity price inflation while maintaining our unwavering commitment to be competitive in the eyes of our consumer. Our B2C and B2B E-commerce platforms continued to perform above our expectations. In the quarter, we launched our new business-to-business platform, which now sits on the same platform as our business to consumer site. Our B2B customers have given us very positive feedback on the enhanced selection, content, navigation, search and site performance. Sales growth improved markedly post-launch. We continue to be pleased with the strategic progress we made and remain focused on strengthening our ability to serve our customers, better than anyone else, while continuing to improve our productivity. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their contributions to the financial outcomes we delivered during our second quarter of 2011. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide some financial highlights from our second quarter of 2011. Two, put our second quarter results into context with the key financial dimensions that we use to measure our performance. And three, share with you what we see for the remainder of 2011 and beyond. During the second quarter, our revenue increased 4.4% driven by 130 net new stores over the past 12 months and a comparable store sales increase of 2.5%, which was on top of a 5.8% comp sales increase last year. Our second quarter also marks our 13th out of the last 14 quarters of double-digit Commercial comp sales growth in our Advance stores. Autopart International also delivered a solid second quarter. As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate in the second quarter was 49.7% versus 50.4% in the second quarter last year for a decrease of 72 basis points. The decline versus prior year was driven by increased shrink as a result of short-term execution and operational challenges in managing our accelerated pace to lead in inventory availability, increased supply chain expenses due to investments in HUBs and higher fuel costs, inflation this year compared to last year and the increased mix of Commercial. The margin decrease was partially offset by our continued improvement in merchandising and pricing capabilities. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 50.2%. While we expected a gross profit rate decline during the second quarter, the decrease was slightly larger than we expected due to the higher shrink. We have developed a very strong track record of managing shrink over the past few years and we have confidence that we will get this back in line over the next few quarters. Turning to our cost structure. Our SG&A rate was 37% during the second quarter versus 38.3% during the second quarter of 2010. This 138-basis point decrease was primarily due to the reduced incentive comp as a result of a lower comp store sales growth, benefits from our new variable customer-driven labor model, which includes the anniversary of investment rollout expenses, as well as a significant decrease in support costs from our operating model work. Partially offsetting this were increased investments in areas such as Commercial, E-commerce, global sourcing and store systems. I will share more on both gross profit and SG&A expenses later in my remarks. All in, our operating income grew 10.1% over our OI rate -- sorry, and our OI rate increased 66 basis points to 12.8% on top of our 121-basis point improvement last year. Our diluted EPS increased 26% to $1.46 versus $1.16 last year. Year-to-date, our diluted EPS is up 19.2% on top of last year's 21.9% comparable EPS increase. Free cash flow through the second quarter was $287.3 million versus $407.6 million last year. The decrease in free cash flow was driven primarily by the change in owned inventory this year-to-date versus last year and higher capital expenditures. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio increased 300 basis points to 75.1% as of the second quarter of 2011, from 72.1% versus the same period last year as part of our continued efforts to reduce our net owned inventory. During our second quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares of our stock for $239.7 million at an average price of $60.31 per share. Through the second quarter, we have repurchased approximately 8.2 million shares of stock at a cost of $509.7 million for an average price of $62.07 per share. These repurchases reflect our view of our valuation and our internal confidence in our company's ability to grow profitability and to create long-term shareholder value. As we stated in our press release, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program. This new authorization replaces the company's $500 million share repurchase program authorized in February 2011, which had a $112 million remaining. Strategically, we continue to position the company for growth and improved profitably. Our performance in our second quarter and over the past 3 years shows we're on the right path and reinforces our commitment to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value. We continue to measure our performance based on these 3 dimensions. Our commitment to growing our business is reflected by another quarter of double-digit Commercial comparable store sales growth. Our Commercial sales per program have grown to $618,000 and over the past 3 years, has grown from $425,000, which represent a 45% increase. Our ability to grow profitability is marked by a 66-basis point improvement in our second quarter operating income rate to 12.8%. Over the past 3 years, we have seen our operating income rate continue to improve and we remain committed to increasing this to 12% over the next few years. We have also seen our earnings per share grow over 20% compounded annual growth rate over the past 3 years. Turning to shareholder value. We continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital as reflected in our return on invested capital, which is now at 18.5% or 200 basis points over the second quarter last year and represents a 420-basis point improvement over the past 3 years. We are also pleased with our 75.1% AP ratio and continue to see opportunities to improve our AP ratio to reduce our owned inventory. Our owned inventory progress is allowing us to lead the industry in inventory per store at $577,000, which is a deliberate part of our superior availability strategy. We are also pleased with the progress we made, reducing our inventory growth to 15.1% in Q2, over the prior year, from the 21.3% growth from Q1. Our availability and quality of our inventory have never been better and has positioned us well to meet our customers' expectations. Looking forward, our improvement from our first quarter to favorable industry dynamics and our internal momentum give us confidence in our ability to continue to grow and improve our profitability. As Darren highlighted, in our press release, we are encouraged by our solid start to our third quarter. While our comparisons are more challenging in the second half of 2011, we believe that the investments that we have made in areas such as commercial, advertising, supply chain, E-commerce and global sourcing, combined with the investments we will make during the second half, positions us to deliver on our annual 2011 EPS outlook. We continue to make progress on our goal to achieve 12% operating margins over the next 2 to 3 years. With a large portion of our capabilities built and the growth momentum we have in areas like Commercial, we are confident in our ability to get there. Over those 2 to 3 years, we expect the drivers to get to 12%, we'll primarily come through a more competitive cost structure and modest gross profit expansion from where we are today. As we look out from a gross profit perspective, we are delighted by the significant improvements we've made in our gross profit rate over the past 3 years and believe that the structural drivers from areas such as global sourcing, future supply-chain efficiencies, availability and merchandising capabilities remain intact and have a modest upside potential longer term. These structural drivers will help offset the continued accelerated growth of our Commercial business as well as inflationary and competitive pressures. That said, in the near term, we continue to expect our gross profit rate will be constrained for the balance of the year driven by supply chain deleverage as a result of the increased investments due to the addition of over 80 HUB stores versus last year and higher fuel prices. Additionally, the timing of price changes will also constrain our gross profit rate as we respond to increased inflationary pressures while balancing our competitiveness. We also see headwinds related to shrink as we refocus our efforts to regain our discipline and processes with respect to our availability initiatives in the short term. Previously, we have said that our gross profit would show a modest increase in 2011. Given the headwinds, we now expect our full year gross profit rate to decline modestly in 2011. Turning to our cost structure. We previously shared that we began the work in 2010 to identify opportunities within our operating model to build a more efficient, sustainable and cost competitive structure to deliver our service model. This work identified a number of opportunities for productivity enhancements, reduce variability across our store performance and reductions in support costs furthest away from the customer. As you can see in our second quarter results, we started to see progress from our operating model work such as increased productivity from areas such as labor in our Commercial programs, reduced variability in store cost outliers and decreased support and discretionary expenses that are furthest away from the customer in areas such as consulting fees, travel and supplies. We are very pleased with the momentum we are building around a more competitive cost structure and continue to be on track to deliver our flat to 2% SG&A per store growth outlook for fiscal 2011. Most importantly, and included in our operating model work, is taking out costs furthest away from the customer that we can continue and invest in customer facing areas such as Commercial, E-commerce and reinvigorating our DIY business. We will continue to make investments in these areas to grow our business, including back half investments in areas such as Commercial. These back half investments are included in our SG&A for store outlook. In closing, we remain confident, focused and committed to growing our business by delivering on our service promise and improving our profit model. And our second quarter results show we are on the right path. We also could not be more proud of our talented team members for the results they delivered in our second quarter and who continue to propel us towards our full potential. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
154,GV_145977_2012Q2,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Director of Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call. Joshua Moore Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements we intend to be covered by, and we claim the protection under, the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

For planning purposes, our third quarter earnings release is scheduled for November 8, 2012, before market open. And our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, November 8, 2012. To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and welcome to our second quarter conference call. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our 54,000 team members for their hard work and diligence as they navigated us through a challenging quarter. As you have seen in our earnings release this morning, our second fiscal quarter reflected a near-term slowdown within the industry and in our results. Today, I thought it'd be helpful to provide some context and perspective on the drivers of the slowdown. As we anticipated, the second quarter faced weak consumer demand in both DIY and Commercial with significant slowdown in our cold weather markets principally located within the Northeast and Great Lakes regions of the U.S. From a consumer perspective, gas prices continue to weigh on demand. The average gas price increased nearly $0.10 a gallon over the first quarter of this year. The good news is the current outlook is for gas to be lower the rest of the year. Macro environment continues to be stressed with high unemployment and low consumer confidence, which has constrained consumer spending. This was evident across retail and reflective of our business as consumers were only willing to spend the absolute minimum amount on failure-related parts and were willing to defer maintenance purchases. This slowdown in both failure and maintenance spending impacted both DIY and Commercial and led to a deceleration in sales growth versus the first quarter. The principal driver on the deceleration was a sequential quarter-to-quarter decline in the average ticket, while our transaction growth was down modestly. In the non-cold-weather markets, we saw transaction growth from Q1 to Q2 accelerate in the low single digits. The overall company transaction growth in Commercial still remained positive in the low single digits from a comparable store perspective. The average ticket decline reflects a combination of mix of products sold and our pricing position in the second quarter. The industry is experiencing the impact of lower inflation in some key seasonal categories like air conditioning and the absence of escalating oil prices and the impact on the oil change special programs. In addition, there are pockets where the consumer is trading down in select categories in pursuit of savings. Finally, while price promotions are not having an immediate positive impact on the top line, we believe it will positively contribute to our growth in the future. From a geographical perspective, we saw different results throughout the regions of the company with the greatest deceleration in our cold weather markets, again especially in the Northeast and the Great Lakes regions. Our performance in those 2 markets is reflective of the milder weather conditions during the first quarter, which impacted hard parts and pulled the business forward in the second quarter. Our comparable store sales declined mid-single digits in these regions of the country, including our Autoparts International stores within those geographies. Conversely, we saw acceleration from the first quarter through the second quarter in our stores located in the western half of the U.S. Our comparable store sales continue to grow positively, and we're up low single digits in our western geographies, where only 10% of our stores are located, as they continue to be less impacted by severe fluctuations in weather. As a result of the declining ticket and lower DIY transaction counts, our comp store sales decreased 2.7%, which was at the low end of our outlook for the quarter. Additionally, our operating income decreased $19.7 million to $169.2 million in the quarter. This was in line with our outlook for the quarter. Despite achieving our previously shared range of outcomes, we are not satisfied with our performance during the quarter. Yet, we remain encouraged by the fundamentals of our industry and have specific action plans to improve our performance for the balance of the year. As such, we continue to focus on growing Commercial and competing for the right to serve our customers. The last few years have been focused on gaining a level of fundamental or basic competitiveness by implementing the table stakes of the Commercial business, which simply meant investing in the industry's best parts pros, sales team, delivery trucks and parts availability. We continue to focus our efforts in those areas but realize the next level will require us to move from being fundamentally better to providing our customers with even greater levels of reliable service, increased delivery speed and superior availability. As a result, we continue to move forward with the in-sourcing of our Commercial credit function, the opening of our new DC with daily replenishment capabilities, rolling out our B2B e-commerce platforms, electric part -- electronic parts catalog and diagnostic tools for our Commercial customers. These key initiatives will fuel our growth over the next several years and allow us to aggressively grow in Commercial. Our field and sales teams are more focused than ever at running the business with excellence. Kevin will provide you with an update on our progress in the opening of our DC and other operations update. As we start our third quarter and look to the back half of the year, we continue to anticipate sluggish consumer demand and choppiness in our business performance. I want to stress we view this as a moment of unevenness versus a longer-term downward trend in the industry or our performance. In the upcoming quarter, and possibly for the balance of the year, we anticipate we will continue to see lower transaction counts driven by DIY, partially offset by slight improvements in our average ticket. However, in the second half of the year, we will continue to roll out our new Commercial program and make investments and focus our efforts in the following areas: improving our availabilities through the addition of new and converted hub stores and inventory upgrades, these availability investments will translate into roughly $60 million of increased parts inventory; we are increasing our traffic-driving advertising to stem the decline in transactions and increase the number of customers that visit our stores; we continue to grow our Commercial sales force and anticipate growing our team by roughly 5%; and finally, we will continue to maximize our in-store labor to meet our customers' needs and provide superior customer service. We expect, but cannot guarantee, that the hot summer and more normalized winter weather will provide a lift as we enter the back half of the year. However, we remain cautious with our outlook as our current trends suggest that our comp store sales will be constrained. This view of our business is reflected in the outlook Mike will share a little later. Internally, we are working with a sense of urgency and taking steps to drive a better outcome than our trends suggest. Our efforts and our focus remain on generating positive comps for the balance of the year. In closing, I want to share a story of how team members Alex Moore [ph] and Chris Webb recently showed what living our values looks like. Alex, [ph] from our store in Christianburg, Virginia, stayed well after closing one night to help a family who was stranded while driving from Connecticut to Florida. Their alternator and radiator had failed, and their car battery was dead. Chris, an instructional designer on our training team at the support center, who was passing by at 10:30 at night on his way home, saw the car in the parking lot and stopped to offer his help. Alex [ph] and Chris stayed well after midnight, helping our customers get back on the road again in their time of need. I would like to recognize and thank Alex [ph] and Chris for their compassion and their focus on service for the decisions they made to help create an Advance customer for life. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin? Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their hard work during the second quarter. I'll provide updates on the work that occurred during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy and new store growth. As Darren mentioned, our soft performance during the quarter does not overshadow the long-term fundamentals of both our business and industry. Our focus on increasing breadth and depth of our end market product assortment and availability remains and will continue to aggressively move forward with the availability initiatives we laid out at the beginning of the year. Those initiatives include: the expansion of our hub network, the continuous upgrade of our parts inventory at our non-hub stores, the opening of our new DC, and the continued growth and rollout of our B2C and B2B e-commerce platforms, Commercial diagnostic tool and our electronics -- electronic product catalog. Hubs and inventory upgrades continue to be a vital component to our availability strategy as it allows us to provide superior end market parts availability. Due to the aging fleet of vehicles, both maintenance and failure parts have increased in order of importance for our DIY and Commercial customers. We continue to expect the demand for these products to increase as the average age of vehicles increase despite the current slowdown in demand due to unseasonably warm weather. As a result, we continue to increase the number of hubs through new store expansion and upgrade of existing stores which have the space and are strategically positioned to operate as a hub. At the end of our second quarter, our total hub count was 320 versus 288 in the second quarter of last year. Additionally, we upgraded the inventory in 231 non-hub stores during the quarter. As I mentioned, increasing our parts availability is critical to our success and growth. However, we've been working to ensure to free up capital to fund other parts of our business. As such, we continue to expand our accounts payable-to-inventory ratio, which increased roughly 784 basis points from 75.1% at the end of second quarter last year to 82.9%. As a direct result, we've reduced our owned inventory by 31.3% or 163.4 million from 521.6 million to 358.2 million. As previously stated, our new Remington, Indiana distribution center was slated to start receiving product in the second quarter, and I'm delighted that we successfully achieved that milestone. Work is now under way to schedule the first outbound shipments in mid-September. We will ship product to our stores in phases, ramping up to 400 stores next year. We're also excited about our ability to provide improved availability by providing daily replenishments to over 200 stores next year. Essentially, adding this new capability will allow us to provide greater coverage to the cars in the market and the customers we serve. We continue to focus on growing our business through our expanded penetration of our B2B capabilities to our Commercial customers as well as through successful new store openings. During the second quarter, we opened 10 stores, including 3 Autopart International stores. Year-to-date, we've opened 35 stores, including 6 Autopart International stores. As of July 14, 2012, our total store count was 3,692, including 203 Autopart International stores. We remain on pace to open approximately 120 to 140 stores this year. Our gross profit rate increased 16 basis points to 49.9 versus 49.7 during the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by improvements in shrink and supply chain expenses due to labor productivity and lower fuel costs, partially offset by increased promotional activity and a higher mix of Commercial sales. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate was 50.0, a 14-point-basis decline over the same period in fiscal 2011. Again, I'd like to thank the team for their hard work during this challenging environment. We remain confident in the priorities we've laid out, and our teams are working diligently to ensure our focus does not get diluted and that we execute our initiatives and the fundamentals of our business flawlessly. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in more detail. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers as we navigated through a challenging second quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights from our second quarter of 2012; two, put our second quarter and year-to-date results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2012. During our first quarter earnings call, we shared that we were tempering our second quarter expectations given our slow start to the quarter. We ended up coming in at the lower end of the outlook range we shared for the quarter. We believe our softness is a function of the tough economic environment that is taking a toll on our customers, as evidenced in our maintenance categories, and the lingering impacts of this year's milder winter. This latter point is evidenced by the significant softness we experienced in our cold weather market such as the Northeast and Great Lakes areas. This softness drove weakness in both our DIY and Commercial businesses and our Autopart International stores. While we are disappointed with our second quarter performance, we also know our relative underperformance can be partially explained by the fact we have more stores in colder weather markets. For our second quarter, our total sales decreased 1.3% to nearly $1.5 billion driven by a comp store sales decrease of 2.7%, partially offset by the net addition of 65 new stores over the past 12 months. Year-to- date, our total sales increased 1.2% to $3.4 billion, and our comp store sales are flat. As Kevin mentioned, our second quarter gross profit rate increased 16 basis points to 49.9% versus 49.7% in the second quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by improvements in shrink and supply chain expenses due to the labor productivity and lower fuel costs, partially offset by promotional activity and a higher mix of Commercial sales. Our Commercial mix represented 38% of our 2012 sales versus 37.2% in 2011. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased 14 basis points to 50% versus 50.2% over the same period last year. Our SG&A rate of 38.3% increased 135 basis points versus the second quarter of 2011 primarily due to expense deleverage as a result of our 2.7% comp store sales decline and a planned shift of expenses from first to second quarter, partially offset by lower year-over-year incentive compensation expenses. Year-to- date, our SG&A rate decreased 56 basis points to 38.5% versus 39.1% over the same period last year. All in, our second quarter operating income dollars decreased 10.4%, and our operating income rate decreased 119 basis points to 11.6% primarily driven by the planned SG&A shift from first to second quarter and the SG&A deleverage from the lower comp sales. While our diluted earnings per share decreased 8.2% to $1.34 versus $1.46 last year, roughly $0.08 was due to the SG&A shift. The planned shift in expenses, which was previously communicated during our first quarter conference call, was driven by our annual general managers' meeting and some strategic investments. Through the first half of 2012, our operating income dollars increased 5% to $393.8 million, and our diluted EPS increased 12.5% to $3.14. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $265.4 million, down 7.6% over the same period last year. The decrease was driven by increased accounts payable as a result of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program and lower deferred income taxes due to the lapse of certain corporate tax legislation, offset partially by continued reductions in our owned inventory. As Kevin mentioned, our owned inventory decreased 31.3% from second quarter 2011 driven by our continued efforts to increase our accounts payable-to-inventory ratio, which now stands at 82.9% versus 75.1% in the second quarter of 2011. We are maintaining our previously communicated annual free cash flow outlook to still be a minimum $400 million, which includes our previously communicated increase in accounts receivable of $80 million to $100 million, with a full year from in-sourcing our commercial credit program. We are excited about this new capability as it will allow us to provide a higher level of customer service to our existing Commercial customers, help fuel our Commercial growth as we increase our credit penetration with customers and allow us to build deeper relationships with our customers at lower costs. At the end of the second quarter, we had $448.6 million of cash and $600 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x, which is well below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. Our average diluted share count was 74 million shares at the end of the second quarter. While we're not meeting our expectations as we go through this soft period, we remain confident with the solid industry fundamentals, the commercial market opportunity and our team's ability to improve our performance. We continue to measure our performance through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. As we have consistently communicated, we prioritize growth as our primary use of capital to increase shareholder value, which includes growing our business through our strategic investments, our operational performance and looking for future growth opportunities or strategic capabilities that capitalize on the market growth opportunity. While we see growth as our primary focus to increase shareholder value, we will continue to use share buybacks opportunistically. At the end of our second quarter, we have roughly $500 million left on our share repurchases authorization. While there will be moments in time where investors will attempt to read into our share repurchase activity, we want to remind investors that we take a long-term, disciplined approach to share repurchases, and we measure our success over years and not over quarters. We continue to maintain the same disciplined approach with respect to share repurchases, which is focused on creating long-term value, not short-term earnings. While this can have a tendency to frustrate short-term shareholders, this philosophy has allowed us to purchase over 41% of the company at an average price of roughly $43 since 2004. Turning to profit. We continue to improve our profitability, which is reflected in our operating income per store and our trailing 4-quarter operating income rate of 11%, which is up 100 basis points from 10% during the second quarter last year. We have been able to invest in both Commercial and availability while preserving our in-store service levels by maintaining the same levels of labor hours in our stores. We've been able to fund these investments by managing our cost structure through our continued focus to build a more efficient, competitive and profitable operating model. As we look at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 19.9%, which increased 140 basis points over the second quarter of last year. Our ROIC has increased over 600 basis points over the past 4 years. We're also pleased with our 82.9% AP ratio, which continues to lower our owned inventory, and we believe we can get our AP ratio to 100% over time. Turning to the balance of the year. While we are not satisfied with our second quarter performance, we believe that the long-term industry dynamics and -- are solid, and our commitment is unwavering to continue our strategic investments at the same pace as we originally planned, which are focused on Commercial, availability, supply chain and e-commerce. These are foundational to our future growth, and thus, we will not slow or change the timing of them. That said, our business trends continue to be soft with a challenging consumer environment. This, coupled with industry growth decelerating and more challenging second half of 2012 comp sales compares, particularly in the fourth quarter, which historically has been our most volatile quarter, require us to take a more prudent approach to our annual outlook. As a result, we now expect our annual comp store sales to be flat to slightly down for 2012. We continue to expect our gross profit rate will improve modestly for the full year, as previously shared in our outlook. We will make the appropriate adjustments in our variable expenses with the changed comp outlook, and we'll maintain our disciplined focus on managing our discretionary and administrative support costs. As a result, we now expect our SG&A per store will be down 1% to 2% for 2012. With these changes, we now anticipate our fiscal 2012 EPS to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.35 per share. In closing, I would like to thank our talented team members again for their resolve and focus to serve our customers during our challenging second quarter. We have confidence in our team as they have shown many times that when faced with adversity, they always respond with character, resiliency and competitive spirit. We expect to rise to the challenge to improve our performance. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

To be notified of dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations website. Finally, a replay of this call will be made available on our website for 1 year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. And I'd like to start off by thanking our 54,000 team members for their hard work and dedication as we continue to strive to better serve our customers and grow our business. Joining me on the call today is our President, George Sherman, who'll provide you with an update on our 2013 priorities; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, who will update you on our financials. While we are pleased with our nearly 100 basis point gain in operating income rate achieved in the quarter, which resulted from improvement in our gross profit rate and more disciplined expense control, we are disappointed with our comparable store sales performance. As we shared with you on the first quarter call, despite our positive start to the second quarter, our sales outlook remained guarded to ensure the sustainability of yearly trends. Shortly after the call, our sales softened and the weakness continued throughout the rest of the quarter, leading to a comparable store sales decline of 0.3%. Our comparable store sales decline was driven by our DIY business and partially offset by an increase in our commercial sales. While our sales were softer than expected in the quarter, we believe that the long-term fundamentals of the industry remain positive. Some of these factors include the increasing age of vehicles, which are now over 11 years, with 70% of those vehicles over 7 years old, stabilizing gas prices and increasing number of miles driven. However, as we discussed last quarter, we are still dealing with several unfavorable macro factors, including more consumers contemplating the purchase of new vehicles, which creates some short-term volatility as consumers are selective about how much more money to spend on aging vehicles. The economy also remains challenged by higher payroll taxes, high unemployment and financial stress on our core customers. Further, in an economy of necessity, consumers are only performing repairs that are absolutely necessary to keep their vehicles on the road. As a result, deferred maintenance remains at record levels. For example, our base oil business, which is core to our maintenance business, was down low single-digits in Q2. Conversely, we are encouraged by the turnaround in our brake and ride control business after a tough first quarter. Additionally, we saw significant impacts to seasonal categories of our business due to one of the wettest second quarters on record in the eastern half of the United States versus record heat in the southwest. These weather conditions helped drive double-digit increases in wiper sales and lifted the gross margin rates, but at the same time had a significant negative sales impact on several seasonal categories like wash and wax, air conditioning and radiators. Our comparable store sales shortfall was offset by improvements in our gross margin and disciplined expense control in the quarter. The team effectively managed our gross profit rate to 50.3%, which was 40 basis points greater than Q2 of last year despite continuing headwinds from full operations of our new Remington distribution facility. Similarly, our diligent expense management resulted in an SG&A rate of 37.7% in the quarter. The rate improved 58 basis points in the second quarter versus Q2 last year. We saw improvements across all areas of the business, in the store support center, field infrastructure and labor productivity as measured by our sales per hour. We believe that some of the pullbacks cut into our top line growth in select areas. That being said, it was consistent with our profitable sales growth and long-term 12% operating margin goals as a company. Culturally, the focus on achieving profitable sales growth will result in quarters like this one. Striking the right balance is important and I'm proud of how the team delivered on our bottom line goals. Overall, we remain committed to our 2 core strategies of service leadership and superior availability. Collectively, the company financial objective is to expand our operating margins to 12% over the next 3 years. Our second quarter operating income rate improvement of 98 basis points is a solid step towards our goals. Mike will share more details in a moment. In 2013, we introduced our company to, one, focus on the fundamentals as our core objective that will guide us for the foreseeable future. Similarly, the outcome to make the day for our customers, which drives our sales and profitability, is the measure of success. Broadly, when I step back and look at the direction of Advance over the last 5 years, we remain on track with our original mission focus of diversifying the position of the company to reflect the broader auto aftermarket. Structurally, the customers and the addressable $40 billion market for Commercial is nearly double the size of DIY and growing at 2x the rate of DIY. Our Commercial business is expected to be over $2.5 billion by the end of 2013 and will represent approximately 40% of our business, which is up from $1.5 billion 5 years ago. We remain committed to the original mission. Our growth has been driven by focusing on basic core capabilities to serve Commercial customers, including improved availability, sales force development, Commercial Parts Pro deployment, delivery driver and truck expansion, B2B and other capabilities. The buildup of these basic core capabilities are complete with few exceptions. The key remaining capabilities are our daily replenishment supply chain and our commercially focused EPC, which are still in the very early stages of rollout. These capabilities position us to take our sales per advanced commercial program, which stands at $640,000, to much higher levels over time. We intend to complete our daily replenishment centers and retrofits over the next 5 years and our EPC rollout in 2014. Capabilities, though important, only enable growth, whereas consistency of our sales, service and operations are required to take the next step in accelerating our business. Growth and focus on the fundamentals has supplanted building capabilities as our key objective for the next 5 years. Predictably, growth includes our new commercially formatted stores, our BWP commercial acquisition and commercial services, including MotoLogic, DriverSide and Keylink. The customer channel growth that we've prioritized for 2013 has been our Commercial National Accounts. I am very pleased that Monroe has expanded its business with us in the quarter, and Goodyear has awarded us with first call status in key parts of the country. National Accounts were a natural next step in our commercial growth, and they're growing at double digits in 2013. Looking ahead, heavy duty, fleet, PP&E, government and banner programs are still ahead of us, which our key competitors include in their numbers today. Holistically, diversifying our business while adding more growth options will enhance both our financial and business objectives. Focus on the fundamentals is about prioritizing consistency over building new capabilities. Consistency in our sales, service and operational execution is always easier said than done. Our recent management changes, to more tightly integrate the leadership, sales and operations of our business are expressly focused on the cultural and operational priorities of the business, specifically, the need to simplify our operations while consistently raising the level of service is what George will discuss in a few moments. Overall, the results for the second quarter are encouraging, including our 6.1% total sales gain, driven by our growth, including the acquired BWP stores and our new stores. Our Autoparts International sales grew 13% during the second quarter versus the second quarter last year, while improving our operating income by 21%. We continue to grow the number of stores served out of our new Remington Distribution Center and are seeing the expected sales lift. Fundamentally, both our gross margin rate and sales per labor hour performance reached near-record levels in the quarter as well. Finally, the leaders that are focused on moving from building capabilities to driving sales and operational excellence began the transition into their new roles this quarter. In closing, I'd like to share an example of how growth and focus on the fundamentals bring ""service is our best part"" to life. Under the leadership of Regional Vice President, Morgan Schafer, I'm proud to announce that tomorrow, we are opening our 4,000th store, which will be located in Montgomery, New York. This is a significant milestone in the company's history and further evidence of our commitment to long-term growth and continuing to serve our customers I couldn't be prouder of Morgan and his team, District Leader Michelle Murphy and General Manager, Melissa Mertey [ph] as they prepare to open this new store. Morgan is a consistent leader with proven results, and I'm excited about the work he will continue to lead for us. This new store is also another example of continued expansion in the Northeast, which is a strategic growth area for us. Morgan, Michelle and Melissa, thank you for your roles in this historic achievement in Advance's history. Lastly, as you know, George Sherman joined us as President about 90 days ago. And I'm excited that he is taking ownership in ramping up on much of our operational work he will update you on today. I'm encouraged by the progress we have made in our strategic initiatives, and I know under George's leadership, we will continue to see positive results in these areas. While we are not satisfied with our comp store sales, we feel that the progress we made on the gross margin and SG&A is a step in the right direction. I have confidence that George will lead us to accomplishing our previously stated goal of getting 12% operating income rate in the next 3 years while also driving increased sales. I will now turn the call over to George to update you on the work he is leading on our 5 key priorities that support our 2013 objectives. George? George E. Sherman Former President Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. I, too, would like to thank our over 54,000 team members for their commitment to customer service while making strides in our 2013 priorities during the quarter. During my first 90 days, I had the opportunity to visit stores in many markets, visit with Commercial customers and also spend time with our support staff at our offices. I'm excited at the potential I see in our team members and customers. Realizing the potential of each and every team member and customer will be critical to our success in 2013 and beyond. I'll now provide you with an update in our 5 key priorities that support our 2013 objectives of growth and focus on the fundamentals. First, growing our Commercial business through improved levels of delivery, speed and reliability and increased customer retention and share wallet with national and regional customers. Our delivery speeds continue to improve across-the-board, and commercial credit penetration continues to grow as a result of our insource credit program. We're proud to be able to add Goodyear to our growing national accounts base, and we're continuing to grow our national accounts. We also saw double-digit growth in our national and regional accounts during second quarter, which is a critical component of our Commercial growth strategy. While B2B e-commerce business is up roughly 40% in the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the industry-leading e- services offerings we have for our Commercial customers. As a result of these efforts, we saw positive comp store sales gains in our Commercial sales. When including the acquired BWP stores, our mix of business in Commercial during the quarter grew to 40.3% versus 38.1% during the second quarter of 2012. Second, improving our local market availability. Our work continues to increase the number of hubs that we operate through the new store openings and the upgrade of existing stores that had the space and are strategically located to operate as hubs. Throughout the second quarter we've expanded our hub store count to 354, which is an increase of 34 since the second quarter last year. We also continue to see progress with our operations at our Remington DC. As previously stated, we anticipate 400 stores will be serviced by Remington this year. Through our second quarter, we have 355 stores receiving shipments from Remington at least once per week, with more than half of those stores receiving daily replenishment. The results of the stores receiving daily delivery continues to be promising, as they've been achieving the expected sales lift since receiving their deliveries versus their control source within the region driven by parts categories. We're still in the early stages and we'll continue to monitor results over the next several months before we can draw any definitive conclusions. Third, expanding our new store footprint. As you'll recall, we completed the acquisition of 124 BWP stores at the beginning of the fiscal year, we're well into the full integration of the BWP stores into Advance stores and the sales and profitability of the BWP stores are currently exceeding our expectations. Most importantly, during the transition, we're remaining focused on employee retention and customer service. Our first 2 stores have been successfully converted, our product lines are beginning to roll through the supply chain, and we expect to convert approximately 40% of the stores by year-end. We remain on track for finishing the integration by mid-2014, consistent with the timeframe previously communicated. During the quarter, we added 21 new Advance Auto Parts stores and 5 new Autopart International stores, keeping us on track for a more aggressive new store opening plan this year. The performance of our 2012 and 2013 classes of stores continue to exceed expectations, primarily driven by a faster ramp-up of Commercial business than previous classes of new stores. Fourth, focus on fundamentals starts with consistently executing to exceed our customers' expected service levels. While we saw positive signs during the quarter with our increased dollars per transaction, units per transaction and [indiscernible] sales productivity, along with our improved customer satisfaction levels, better profitability and low return rates, we realize this is an area where we need to drive improvement. As part of this focus, we're continuing to improve the level of individual performance to maximize every customer engagement. These efforts include improving our scheduling effectiveness and team member product training which leads to increasing our customer order size by providing our customers with the full solution all the time in order for them to get the job right the first time. In addition, we are enhancing our commercial model to enable a higher rate of growth, including empowering our field teams to meet the demands of our Commercial customers. This includes simplifying how we run our stores, including report in cash reductions, process improvements and placing a clear field-wide focus on business and customer outcomes. Fifth, and finally, improving our profitability for increasing our efficiency and effectiveness to other support areas and our store operating model. The work that our leaders have been doing locally and collectively to identify and deliver efficiencies in our business is a contributing factor to putting us on our trajectory to achieve accelerated profitability and reduce our SG&A per store gap versus our industry peers. For example, the insourcing of our commercial credit processing has significantly reduced the cost of processing those transactions. Additionally, we developed a long-term incentive program designed to accelerate both our profitability and growth. Collectively, our company priorities remain intensely focused on operations to drive results through customer service, enabled through outstanding and consistent execution. Again, I've enjoyed my first 3 months with Advance and could not be more excited about the future growth opportunities for the company. I look forward to continuing to update you on these important priorities in the future. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their continued efforts to improve our business and serve our customers as we navigated through our second quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: 1, provide some financial highlights from our second quarter of 2013; 2, put our second quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and 3, provide some insights on the remainder of 2013. As we shared on our first quarter earnings call, we were encouraged with the strong start we had to our second quarter, and we were somewhat tempered with our sales expectations. Looking forward, as we were unclear of how much of our strong start was the result of a bounceback from the delayed spring versus a fundamental rebound in consumer demand. We are not satisfied with our second quarter comp sales performance, which softened in the final 6 weeks of the quarter after tracking up 2% in the first 6 weeks. We believe this softness was the result of record levels of precipitation in our core markets and a continued challenging macroeconomic environment on our consumer, such as increased payroll taxes. While we are disappointed with negative comps sales, our operating profits grew 15.1% versus second quarter last year and exceeded expectations, driven by both an increase in gross profit rate and disciplined expense management, which led to a 98 basis point increase in our operating income rate of 12.6% for the quarter as we work towards our longer-term operating margin goal of 12%. We remain focused on influencing the things that are in our direct control and positioning our company for longer-term growth and profitability by maintaining our strategic focus, executing on the fundamentals and simplifying our operations. While we are pleased with our bottom line results during the quarter, we realize, in order to achieve our 12% goal, we must improve our sales performance while continuing the disciplined spending we've exhibited over the last 2 quarters. As a result of the weaker consumer demand and record levels of precipitation throughout the majority of the eastern half of the United States, our comp store sales decreased 0.3%. Our total sales, however, increased 6.1% to $1.5 billion, driven by the acquisition of BWP and the net addition of 175 new stores over the past 12 months. Our comp store sales decrease was driven by declines in our DIY sales, partially offset by positive growth in Commercial sales. Year-to-date, our total sales increased 4.3% to $3.6 billion, and our comp store sales declined 2%. Our gross profit rate in the second quarter was 50.3% versus 49.9% in the second quarter of 2012 or an increase of 40 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher merchandising margins, driven by lower product acquisition costs and a favorable product mix, partially offset by planned increases in supply chain costs associated with the operation of our new Remington DC and the impact of BWP sales, which have a lower gross margin rate due to their higher mix of Commercial sales. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate increased 30 -- 13 basis points to 50.1% from 50% over the same time period last year. Our SG&A rate of 37.7% decreased 58 basis points versus the second quarter of 2012, primarily driven by the timing of last year's company-wide leadership meeting, lower marketing expense, improved labor productivity and a decrease in credit card fees as a result of the insourcing of our commercial credit program. These were partially offset by higher incentive compensation due to individual store team member performance and operating income growth, fixed cost deleverage as a result of our negative comparable store sales and increased new store openings. Year-to-date, our SG&A rate increased 46 basis points to 39% versus 38.5% over the same period last year. All in, our operating income was $194.7 million, which was an increase of 15.1% versus second quarter of 2012. This exceeded expectations and is a testament to our ability to drive our gross profit expansion and the team's disciplined focus on expense management despite softer comp store sales performance. Our operating income rate increased 98 basis points to 12.6% in the second quarter. The increased operating income rate came both from our Advance stores, as well as our Autopart International business, which grew operating income over 20% during the quarter. Our EPS increased 18.7% versus Q2 last year to $1.59 per share and includes $0.01 of transition costs associated with the integration of BWP. We still anticipate the transition of BWP will occur over an 18-month period from acquisition, and the associated costs with 2013 to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20. Through the first half of 2013, our operating income dollars increased 1.3% to $398.8 million, and our diluted EPS increased 2.9% to $3.23, including $0.03 of BWP integration costs. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $27.9 million, which is down 89.5% over the same period last year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of BWP. Excluding the net impact of the acquisition, our free cash flow would have been $198.3 million compared to $265.4 million over the same time period last year, primarily due to an unfavorable change in owned inventory, offset by less capital expenditures. Our owned inventory is approximately flat to Q2 2012, and our accounts payable to inventory ratio is 85.1% versus 82.9% in the second quarter of 2012. Our total inventory increased 14.8%, driven by our new Remington DC, more hubs, more new stores and the acquisition of BWP. This increase was higher than our expectations due to a lower-than-anticipated sales performance. At the end of the second quarter, we had roughly $605 million of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. We continue to measure our performance of our business through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. We continue to prioritize growth as our primary use of capital in order to increase returns and drive shareholder value. As a result, our focus continues to be on accelerating our commercial growth and stabilizing our DIY business. We plan to achieve this goal by improving our availability through our hub store openings, inventory upgrades, supply chain investments and strengthening our market position with increased new store openings. We are proud of our improved coverage and in-market availability, driven by the areas that George covered. We're also proud of the accelerated pace of our new store openings, including the net addition of 21 new stores in the second quarter. This includes the opening of 21 new Advance Auto Parts stores and 5 new Autopart International stores, offset by the closing of 3 Advance stores, one Autopart International store and the consolidation of one BWP store into an existing Advance store. At the end of Q2, our total store count was 3,990. Including the acquisition of BWP in Q1, we've increased our net store count by 298 over the last 12 months. We remain on pace to open 170 to 190 new Advance Auto Parts stores and Autopart International stores this year. We continue to prioritize our use of capital to drive shareholder value by, first, investing in the business; second, looking at strategic opportunities; and thirdly, returning money to shareholders through share repurchases. In every case, we have taken a disciplined approach to capital deployment, weighing the long-term value creation opportunities of each. Over the past several quarters, we have built up our cash position as we wanted to maintain financial flexibility as we assess a range of organic and inorganic growth investments in our business. As our industry continues to consolidate, we believe there maybe opportunities which will enable us to drive profitable growth and value creation, particularly in the commercial space. As we evaluate these opportunities, we are focused on driving attractive financial returns like we have achieved with our recent acquisition of BWP, which year-to-date has added $0.04 per share to our earnings. With this context, year-to-date, we have deployed over $250 million of capital in a manner consistent with our priorities. This includes investing approximately $180 million in our acquisition of BWP and returning approximately $75 million to shareholders via share repurchases, including $15.7 million in our second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $418 million left under our share repurchase authorization, and our average diluted share count was 73.3 million shares. As we have said before, we take a long- term view and look beyond individual quarters in making our capital allocation decisions as we balance investment opportunities against returning capital to shareholders. Ultimately, our focus is on maximizing long-term value to shareholders in a manner consistent with our capital allocation priorities. And to that end, we do not intend to maintain our current levels of excess cash beyond the short to medium term. Turning to profit. We are pleased that despite softer sales, we were able to exceed our profit expectations in the second quarter. During the quarter, the 98 basis point increase in our operating margins was driven by some of the key drivers we have identified that will help us get to our long-term goal of 12% operating margins. They include gross profit margin improvements driven by our merchant and field teams in the areas of merchandising capabilities, global sourcing and the execution and continued improvement in areas like shrink. We also made progress in our expense management, where our field teams delivered record labor productivity as measured by our sales per labor hour. And we continue to lower our administrative and support costs in areas such as professional fees and credit card fees. As a reminder, the pathway to our 12% goal requires sales growth, modest gross profit improvement and a significant improvement in our cost efficiency and execution. While we are disappointed with our comp store sales performance during the quarter, we believe our gross profit and SG&A progress is a solid step in the right direction. As a result of our commitment to build a more competitive cost structure while funding strategic investments and to employ a more disciplined approach to expense management, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased slightly to $654,000 per store in our second quarter versus $656,000 during the second quarter of 2012. With respect to value creation, we have maintained our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.5%. For the quarter, our ROIC decreased 136 basis points versus the second quarter last year, as a result of our increased invested capital due to the acquisition of BWP, the insourcing of our commercial credit and the accelerated pace of our new store openings. Longer term, we see opportunities to improve our ROIC as we begin to generate benefits from our Remington DC, our acquisition of BWP and as our sales from our new store openings begin to ramp. We also see opportunities to reduce our net owned inventory as we move towards our goal of achieving an AP ratio of 100%. Turning to the balance of the year, given our year-to-date comp of minus 2%, we are now expecting comps will be slightly down for the full year. We continue to expect our gross profit rate will increase modestly, and we'll continue to adjust our costs appropriately given our sales trends to deliver on our profit expectations. All in, we continue to be confident, at this time, in our ability to deliver the previously shared earnings per share annual outlook of $5.30 to $5.45. In closing, we are committed to our strategies in Commercial and availability and remain confident in the industry fundamentals and how we are positioned as a company. We are focused on improving our sales performance while continuing to improve our profitability and strengthening our returns to continue to drive shareholder value. We also want to thank our 54,000 team members who lead us every day with their relentless focus on service and commitment to operational excellence and execution, which are key ingredients to delivering on our goals. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
156,GV_145977_2007Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts third quarter 2007 conference call (Operator Instructions) Before we begin, Eric Margolin, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call. Eric Margolin Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. Certain statements contained in this conference call are forward-looking statements as that term is used in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements discuss, among other things, management succession and expected growth and future performance, including new store openings, remodels and relocations, comparable store sales, sales per store, gross margin, SG&A expenses, operating margin, return on invested capital, free cash flow, accounts payable ratio, capital expenditures, tax rate, and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2008. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions including those disclosed in the companies 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2006, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from anticipated results described in these forward-looking statements. The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. Our results can be found in our press release and 8-K filing which are available on our website at For planning purposes, our fourth quarter earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, February 13, 2008 after market close; and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, February 14, 2008. To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports you can sign up through the investor relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Jack Brouillard, our Chairman, President, and CEO, who will be followed by Jim Wade, EVP of Business Development, and Michael Moore, EVP and CFO. Also joining us today on the call will be Elwyn Murray, EVP, Merchandising Supply Chain and Technology. Jack Brouillard Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. We are pleased to report that we remain on track with the initiatives that we reviewed with you on the last call. Although we anticipated it would take time, we believe the results of those initiatives are beginning to have a positive impact on our sales, earnings, and return on capital. I will spend my time this morning reviewing with you the highlights of our third quarter results, the status of our initiatives, and how we see the business over the coming months. In the third quarter, comp store sales grew by 1.1%, which was in line with our sales growth over the past several quarters, but better than we had expected for the quarter. As you may recall, we forecast our third quarter sales to be in the negative 2% to zero range based on how the quarter started off. After those early weeks, sales trends improved and stayed fairly consistent during the remainder of the quarter. As Jim will discuss, Do-It-For-Me our sales showed solid improvement over our year-to-date run rate, but our Do-It-Yourself trend has not yet improved. We believe that the tough economic environment continues to hamper sales across much of retail, including our business. Our gross margin percent was 28 basis points less in the third quarter than last year, due to several factors that Mike will discuss in more detail. Although gross margin was down in the quarter, we do see the opportunity to continue to grow the gross margin rate as we go forward, although at a lower rate. Overall, SG&A was up 37 basis points in the quarter, but leveraged 18 basis points excluding the severance costs and asset write-offs related to our expense reduction initiatives. We feel this is a solid step in the right direction and reflects our team’s commitment to getting our costs in line. We anticipate additional SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter. We believe the expense reductions we have put in place will not compromise future sales growth. Our priority is to drive the top line while lowering our expense rate. Earnings per share were $0.57 which was at the high end of our guidance range of $0.53 to $0.57 per share. Earnings per share was $0.61 excluding the severance cost and asset write-offs, or an increase of 9% over last year’s third quarter. Now I will provide you an update on the status of our initiatives to drive sales, earnings, and return on capital. As I discussed on our last call, we are in the process of returning to what matters most in the auto parts business to reinvigorate our sales and earnings growth. Our recent business strategy review and the related customer research provided good insight and background for our action plans. First, we are improving parts availability. We are well into implementing our plan to increase parts availability in our stores. We believe this will drive improvement in both our DIY and commercial sales. The plan is focused on greater late model and foreign vehicle coverage, as well as being more aggressive in getting parts into our stores and closer to our customers. I mentioned that our DIFM business has started to improve but that our DIY Business has not yet shown the same trends. Our plan to improve parts availability is on schedule. Some of this increase in coverage has now been distributed to our stores and we anticipate much of it will be completed by year end. We told you on the last call that we expected to fund part of this increase by making our existing inventory more productive. That process is also underway and ahead of schedule; Mike will review our progress. In the short term, we are making select investments in more parts inventory that we believe will help grow sales. Going forward, however, we are committed to grow sales at a rate faster than inventory growth. Second, we are increasing our commercial focus. We said on our last call that we believed we had missed meaningful opportunities to drive our commercial sales and as a result, our comp growth in this area had slowed. We continued to achieve 5% to 6% comps, but believe that undershot our potential in this area. With our increased focus on commercial sales, our commercial comps for the third quarter rose to 8%. We saw an improvement in commercial comps as we went through the quarter and comps continue to run above 8% for the fourth quarter to-date. We continue to look at store staffing and training, compensation policies, truck utilization, and many other areas to best structure us for further commercial growth. You will hear more about this over the next several quarters. Third, we are changing our previous focus on the front room. As part of our ongoing business review, we are improving the productivity and efficiency of our sales floor or front room portion of our stores. We are in the process of rationalizing and removing SKUs within sales floor categories, as well as full categories that do not align with our focus on parts and related items. We now have less frequent end cap rotation, fewer sales floor planogram changes, fewer price changes and less frequent rotation of point of purchase signage. The hours previously spent on these tasks are now being applied to parts-related, sales-driving initiatives. We are on schedule with all the SG&A reductions and return on invested capital improvements we outlined in the last call, as well as having worked through additional cost reductions that Mike will address on this call. The reduction of 250 positions in our field and store support center has been completed. We have reduced our new store openings for 2008. On our last call, we announced guidance of 140-150 new stores for 2008. As we look at the significant changes in many parts of our business that our new strategy requires, we now believe that our new store openings for 2008 will be in the range of 110- 120 stores. We would anticipate store openings will increase in 2009. Jim will talk in more detail about the additional steps we are taking to better align our new store growth strategy with our updated strategic plan and to improve our return on new store investments. We anticipate store relocations to be in the range of ten to 20 stores in 2008 for the same reasons. We halted our 2010 store remodel program. We discontinued our Advanced TV Network in our stores. We eliminated advertising expenditures that we determined were not productive. We continue to test and measure other portions, including our print advertising program and we are implementing a plan for 2008 that will shift expenditures away from print towards more electronic media. In addition, we will be increasing the portion of our total spend targeted to the Hispanic customer. In partnership with our new ad agency, we believe we can achieve greater results in 2008 with less expenditure. We eliminated IT, logistics, and other investments that did not demonstrate an acceptable return. Over the past three years, we have repurchased over 18 million shares, including 6.2 million shares repurchased in the third quarter at an average price of $33.26. We see this as an excellent use of our capital at our current stock price and as we generate additional free cash flow, we will review further purchases. We are also currently evaluating taking on additional debt to repurchase shares. Externally, the economic headwinds continue to be a negative for sales growth. We believe these headwinds have reduced our customer’s ability to make purchases and has led to increased maintenance deferrals. With our parts-focused initiatives, we are pleased to see our parts categories are growing; however, we continue to see softness in our more highly discretionary categories. We believe our focus on parts availability, a more productive and effective advertising program, increasing parts knowledge in our stores, and other initiatives will drive DIY positively but it has not yet offset the economic headwinds and regional challenges. We anticipate that over time, customers will adjust their budgets, and coupled with our initiatives, we will see a benefit. We will not be providing specific guidance for 2008 until the February conference call. However, we will address how we are planning for next year. At this time, we continue to see a challenging sales environment where we believe it is prudent for us to plan comps in the 1% to 2% range until we see our trends show consistent improvement. We anticipate gross margin to improve incrementally by 10 to 15 basis points as we continue to pursue lower costs and leverage our logistics network, but we anticipate that these increases will be somewhat offset by a higher commercial sales mix. Lastly, with our SG&A reductions, we believe we can leverage SG&A in 2008 at the higher end of our forecasted 1% to 2% comp levels. In regard to the CEO search, we feel very good about our progress and expect to announce a new CEO by the end of the year. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim and Michael, who will review further our third quarter results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. Jim Wade Thank you, Jack and good morning. I'll provide a further break down of our sales for the third quarter as well as store growth, and Michael will discuss gross margin and SG&A, as well as our balance sheet and cash flow. Our comp store sales increase for the quarter was 1.1% compared to 1.4% last year. As Jack mentioned, our sales started off slower at the beginning of the third quarter. As the weather in August became warmer, we began to see sales pick up and we saw that momentum continue for the remainder of the third quarter. We've also seen sales continue in the current range so far in the fourth quarter, and we believe we are seeing a positive impact from our sales initiatives even though the macroeconomic environment remains challenging. On a geographic basis, comps continue to be stronger in the North and Midwest and weaker in Florida and the Gulf Coast. Our comps, excluding Florida and the Gulf Coast, were 2.1% in the third quarter. The comps in Florida and the Gulf Coast improved slightly over the second quarter. During the third quarter, our DIY comps were a negative 1% compared to negative 0.6% last year. We believe we're doing the right things to improve DIY and will be well-positioned over the next several months. Our commercial comps are 8% in the third quarter over 8.7 % last year. As Jack mentioned, the steps we're taking to refocus on commercial growth has started to show up in our comps as the 8% comp in the third quarter grew from the 5.4% comp in the first half of 2007. Our focus remains on getting our commercial comps back to the double-digit run rate we've previously achieved. Our commercial comps continue to run in the 8% plus range in the fourth quarter to date. Commercial sales, including Autopart International, represented 27% of our total sales for the quarter. Our total commercial sales were approximately $314.1 million, a 13% increase over last year. During the quarter, we added 46 new commercial programs to our Advance Auto Parts stores, most of which were in our new stores, bringing the total number of Advance stores with commercial programs to 2,571. Today, about 82% of our Advance stores have commercial programs, compared to 81% for the third quarter last year. In the third quarter we opened 43 new stores; 39 of these new stores opened as Advance Auto Parts and four opened as Autopart International. Year-to-date we've opened 156 new stores, 139 as Advance and 17 as AI. We closed two stores in the quarter and ten year-to-date. Our new store productivity remained comparable to last year. We continue to expect to open 190 to 200 stores in 2007 through a combination of Advance and AI stores. As Jack mentioned, we now expect to open 110 to 120 new stores in 2008. This represents an approximate 6% rate of growth in 2007 and 3.5% to 4% in 2008. In 2007 and 2008, we anticipate all of our new stores will open within our existing 40 state footprint. Year-to-date we've relocated 24 stores and foresee approximately 30 relocations in 2007. We anticipate ten to 20 relocations in 2008. We mentioned last quarter that we're doing a complete review of our new store strategy and related occupancy costs as part of our overall strategy SG&A and CapEx review. That project is now well underway and we've identified a number of opportunities to more closely align our go-forward focus on what matters most in being a parts store, while reducing our new store site and building costs. We're looking at where we can locate our stores to maximize both our DIY and our commercial sales. Previously our focus was on maximizing DIY sales and then capturing available commercial sales. We're testing smaller prototype buildings and different store layouts to optimize parts availability and sales floor needs. Some of these opportunities can be implemented quickly, and some will take time as we work through our new store pipeline. In the meantime, we'll open new stores at a reduced pace in 2008. With our real estate activity in 2007, we ended the quarter with 3,124 Advance Auto Parts stores and 104 Autopart International stores for a total store count of 3,228 stores. Now, let me turn the call over to Michael to review our financial results. Michael Moore Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let me begin with our income statement. For the quarter, gross margin was 47.9%, a 28 basis points decrease over last year’s rate of 48.2%. Gross margin was down from last year, primarily due to a less favorable merchandise sales mix this year. In addition, fewer discounts were earned as merchandise purchases were less than year-ago levels, and we had a greater proportion of commercial sales this year. Third quarter was our most difficult quarterly comparison of the year. Third quarter 2006 was a 100 basis point improvement over the prior year, while the entire year of 2006 was 50 basis points higher than 2005. Looking forward, we expect lower procurement cost and logistics efficiencies will more than offset the unfavorable rate impact of a greater mix of commercial sales and that our gross margin rate will grow over time by ten to 15 basis points per year. For fourth quarter, we expect gross margin percent to be in line with fourth quarter last year. LIFO was a $0.4 million charge in this year’s quarter compared to a $0.4 million credit in last years third quarter. Going forward, we would expect modest LIFO credits in most quarters as we benefit from lower costs in most product categories. Turning now to SG&A. In the quarter, we recorded a pretax charge of $6.3 million or $0.04 per share in severance costs related to our position eliminations and asset write-offs associated with shutting down the Advance TV Network. On a reported basis, our SG&A rate for the quarter was up 37 basis points. However, excluding the severance and asset write-offs, we leveraged SG&A by 18 basis points as compared to last year. This was an improvement of 62 basis points over the 44 basis points of de-leverage we saw in the first half of 2007. Over the past quarter, we have taken a number of steps to further reduce our expense structure. We have identified additional expense initiatives that will reduce SG&A by more than $20 million in 2008. These are in addition to the $50 million in expense reduction initiatives that we announced in conjunction with our last quarterly earnings report. These expense reductions include savings in advertising and marketing, store occupancy, utilities, transportation expense, non-merchandise purchasing costs, and an additional 30 positions in our field and store support center that have been eliminated. These new initiatives will impact 2007 to a minimal degree but will favorably impact 2008 by $20 million. As Jack stated, we believe the expense reductions we have put in place will not compromise future sales growth. Our priority is to drive the top line while lowering our expense rate. In fourth quarter 2007, as a result of the expense reduction initiatives that we have implemented, we expect to leverage SG&A within our comp sales guidance of zero to 2%. Interest expense, net of interest income, was $7.6 million in the quarter compared to $9.1 million last year. Interest expense decreased from last year as a result of less debt outstanding and lower borrowing costs. Our borrowing costs in the quarter was approximately 6%. In third quarter last year, in conjunction with the refinancing of our credit facility, we recorded a net pre tax gain of $1.0 million which was recorded in the gain on extinguishment of debt line on the income statement. Our third quarter income tax rate was 36.4% as compared to 37.6% last year. Both this year and last year’s income tax included a benefit from a successful completion of state income tax audits. In addition, this year included the benefit of additional federal and state tax credits. In the fourth quarter, we expect our tax rate to be in the 37.8% to 38.0% range. Now, I will review key components of our balance sheet and our cash flow statement. For the quarter, inventory increased 5.4% on a sales increase of 5.3%. This was a significant improvement over the second quarter and reflects our focused plan to improve inventory productivity while increasing parts availability. Even with our significant investment additional parts inventory, we expect that inventory will grow only slightly higher than sales in the fourth quarter. We expect to fund the majority of our investment in additional parts availability through several inventory reduction initiatives. We expect that our parts availability initiative will require an investment of approximately 5% of our total inventory; however, we expect to offset most of this incremental investment through the rebalancing of inventory in selected categories and stores and other inventory reduction actions. We expect that our net incremental investment, net of accounts payable, will be less than 1% of total inventory. As Jack said, we are making investments in additional parts inventory that we believe will help grow sales. Going forward, however, we are committed to grow sales at a rate faster than inventory growth. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 55.9% compared to 55.4% last year. We continue to see opportunity to grow our AP ratio. As a result of working with our suppliers, we expect that this ratio will exceed the prior year’s corresponding ratio for the fourth quarter. On the cash flow statement, our capital expenditures were $31 million for the quarter and $147 million year-to-date. This compares to $201 million year-to-date last year or a reduction of $54 million. We now estimate capital expenditures for 2007 to be $215 million to $225 million, a reduction from our previous guidance of $230 million to $240 million. Our 2007 capital expenditures break down as follows: $110 million for store development which includes new, relocated and remodeled stores; $70 million in maintenance capital for our stores, distribution centers and corporate infrastructure, primarily IT-related; $15 million for new IT and logistics initiatives; and $25 million for our ninth distribution center in Indiana. As a result of fewer new store openings in 2007 and 2008 than originally planned, we have pushed the opening of our next distribution center to the beginning of 2010. Our efforts to improve return on invested capital are beginning to show up in our free cash flow. As a result of lower capital spending and less working capital required, we are now increasing our free cash flow estimate for full year 2007. We now expect free cash flow for the year to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $150 million to $170 million and compares to $83 million in free cash flow generated in 2006, or more than a 140% increase. In the quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million shares or approximately 6% of our total outstanding at an average price of $33.26, for a total expenditure of $207 million. In the last three years, we have repurchased over 18 million shares at a cost of nearly $600 million. We now have $335 million left on the share repurchase authorization approved by the board of directors on August 2007. As a result of our share repurchases, our fully diluted third quarter share count was 103.2 million shares, a reduction of more than 4 million shares from second quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect our fully diluted share count to decrease to slightly less than 102 million shares, assuming no share repurchases in the fourth quarter. As Jack said, we are currently evaluating adding debt to fund additional share repurchases. We believe that we have some flexibility to increase leverage and still maintain our current debt rating. In terms of updated guidance for comp store sales, we are reaffirming our guidance of zero to 2% for fourth quarter. We continue to base our guidance on an assumption that a challenging macroeconomic environment will continue through the fourth quarter and because of the implementation timeframe, our sales-building initiatives will positively impact sales to a limited degree in 2007. We expect fourth quarter gross margin percent to be more in line with last year, as compared to the third quarter. Also, we expect to leverage SG&A in the fourth quarter as a result of the expense initiatives we have implemented. We expect earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter to be $0.36 to $0.40, an increase of 9% to 21%; and for the year, to be $ 2.28 to $2.32. Excluding the $0.04 per share in severance, cost and asset write-offs recorded in the third quarter, earnings per diluted share for the year are expected to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.36, an increase of 7% to 9%. Although we will not be providing 2008 earnings guidance until our fourth quarter call, we are providing guidance for some of our operating metrics for 2008. As Jack stated, in 2008 we are basing our planning on a 1% to 2% comp sales increase. We expect an improvement in gross margin of ten to 15 basis points and we expect to leverage SG&A at a 2% comp level. In addition, as Jim stated, in 2008 we are expecting to open 110 to 120 new stores and to relocate ten to 20 existing stores. As a result, we expect 2008 capital expenditures to be in the range of $170 million to $190 million. Also, you should know that 2008 will be a 53 week fiscal year. In summary, we believe that all the steps we are taking will position us to grow sales, reduce SG&A expenses and improve return on invested capital going forward. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Jack. Jack Brouillard Thanks, Mike. In closing, I'd like to again thank our team for their commitment over this past quarter. I am confident that our sales-driving initiatives will show solid results over the next few months. We are now ready for questions, operator. <TAG>Question-and-Answer Session</TAG>"
157,GV_145977_2009Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Third Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Director, Finance and Performance Management and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call. Joshua Moore Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the results to differ materially. The most important of these risks, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures, are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. These can be found at our website at advanceautoparts.com. For planning purposes, our fourth quarter earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, February 17, 2010, after market close, and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, February 18, 2010. To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Events in the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, CEO. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'd like to begin by congratulating the team on another successful quarter. Your focus and commitment to the customer, our strategies drove our success in the quarter and year-to-date. Let me review with you where we are in our turnaround and transformation work. We're moving into the final stages of the turnaround of Advance. I'm very proud of our Team Members and their ability to drive continuous improvements in our customer satisfaction and Team Member engagement. Their ability to revitalize our core values and drive our core strategies resulted in our strong top line growth, a 53% increase in our free cash flow and a 19% EPS improvement versus a year ago. Strategy in its simplest form is the art of making a choice. Our turnaround strategy was principally focused on Commercial Acceleration and Availability Excellence to accelerate both growth and profitability. We are pleased with our choice, the results and the long-term potential of that decision. Strategy is also the art of choosing not to do things. Our third quarter results reflect the discipline of making hard choices. Specifically, we accelerated our store closures, cut our investments in DIY [do-it-yourself], including marketing and labor to fund the Commercial and Availability work. Ideally, we could do all things at the same time, but that's just not possible. We entered fiscal 2009 focused on investments that would position us to accelerate and rebalance our four wall of growth and profitability over the long term. This meant investing more in parts pros, labor, parts availability and merchandise capability, while moderating our level of spend in DIY. Arguably, this choice constrained our profitability in the near term in favor of the long term. Yet the results of the strategic choice that we've made fueled our Commercial performance and enabled us to generate our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth in Commercial. Our choices narrowed our focus on parts availability and core merchandising capabilities that ignited four consecutive quarters of over 100 basis points of comparable gross profit expansion. Collectively, these choices drove our 4.7% comp store sales gain during the quarter while delivering a 19% increase in earnings per share, excluding the $0.04 EPS impact from store divestitures. Our sales per square foot increased roughly 5% versus third quarter a year ago, and we have generated a 15.1% return on invested capital, reflecting 100 basis point improvement from just a year ago. Our collective strategic choices have allowed us to increase our total market share, and we remain committed to our strategies, which will balance growth and returns over the long term. As we start preparing for 2010, our transformation will be more purposeful in its approach. We look to build on our momentum in Commercial and Availability Excellence through our Commercial way of efforts and global-sourcing capabilities. We will also begin to strengthen the capabilities and fundamentals of our field operation. Our long-term success will come from our focus on the systemic and sustainable improvement in our customer experience. We will ensure that our two customer-facing organizations have the necessary leadership, technology, process and training to deliver on our value proposition on a consistent and profitable basis. We will continue to focus on our core strategies. However, we will place a higher level of emphasis on the pace and effectiveness of change and consistency of our customer experience through our Superior Experience strategy work. Practically, this is a very hard work, which includes virtually all the Team Members. Specifically, we have just completed the nationwide education program for all of our general managers, assistant managers, Commercial parts pros and retail parts pros to level set them on the roles, responsibilities and goals for the company. We have launched a national training and development program dedicated to each region to accelerate major change in field execution capabilities. We started in some basic areas to work through process in the learning curve. Our preliminary focus has been in areas like shrink, battery returns and Commercial pricing, which will help strengthen our gross margin. Our future focus will be on Commercial operations, improved staffing, sales force effectiveness and other sustainable customer-experience benefit. Our goal is to build on the customer satisfaction commitment with proven capabilities. I am realistic that this will take time but the benefits are sustaining and large . I'd like to share with you how the team embodies and embraces our Advance values. Recently, we recognized a group of 35 high-performing general managers based on sales growth, margin performance, profit growth, as well as team calibration and customer-satisfaction scores and finally, their ability to live and teach our values. This group was recognized for delivering the top results in the country in those areas over the past 12 months and achieving the top 1% of all performance measures. These GMs demonstrate a high standard of operational excellence, reflect the diversity of our team and our customers. They have excelled at driving our key strategic initiative, living our values while focusing on team development, creating synergy in their work force and engaging the teams on a consistent basis. After meeting with these leaders, learning from them and getting to know them, I have no doubt that each of them went back to their respective stores even more inspired and motivated about how they are personally contributing to the turnaround and transformation of our company. Team, I'd like to thank you again for serving our customers better than anyone else and growing the business and the profitability. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim Wade, our President, to provide progress and an update on Commercial Acceleration and our DIY Transformation strategies. Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank our team for another strong quarter. This morning, I will update you on our overall sales results, along with our progress with our Commercial Acceleration and DIY Transformation strategies. Our total comp sales growth for the third quarter was 4.7% compared to flat comps in the same quarter last year. Our 5.2% comp after adjusting for the calendar shift was slightly higher than the 4.8% comp in the second quarter. Again, this quarter, we achieved an increase in both customer transactions and average transaction size. We also outgrew the market for the quarter by approximately 300 basis points. Looking in our Commercial performance, this is our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth with an 11.8% increase in comp store sales for the quarter. This increase was on top of the 10.8% comp increase during the third quarter last year. As a result of the comp growth, our Commercial sales mix as a percent of our total sales increased to 32% towards our goal, 50% or more of our sales in Commercial overtime. We continue to gain a substantial market share in Commercial, as our double-digit growth exceeded the market increase that was in the lower single digit. Even with accelerated growth, our market share in the total Commercial market of over $40 billion is less than 5%, which provides us much room for continued growth. Sales of parts continue to fuel our Commercial growth. Parts have increased as a percent of total Commercial sales, while growth in lower-margin commodities was lower and has decreased in overall sales mix versus last year. Our Commercial gross margin rate continue to increase, driven by increased mix in part sales and better merchandising and operational capabilities. Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the areas of focus that are leading our Acceleration and Commercial. We continue to invest on parts pros, trucks, drivers and upgrade inventories. These investments provide our stores the capacity to grow faster, and our largest comp growth is coming from our markets where these investments have been made. By the end of this year, we have made these investments in parts pros, trucks and drivers in approximately a third of our stores, providing us a long run rate for growth over the next few years. We're making good progress in redefining and aligning the roles and responsibilities of our field and store teams to prepare us for a 50-50 Commercial and DIY sales mix. Our initiative to raise the overall operational consistency of our service to our garages is on track. This includes improved inbound- phone response time, accurate order fulfillments and consistent customer delivery times. We're testing technology in our stores to measure our delivery time and other key predictive indicators of success. This will continue to be a focus in 2010, as we build the operational infrastructure to excel in service Finally, we continue to build and strengthen our Commercial sales force. Through the third quarter, we've increased our sales force by over 140 Team Members, representing nearly a 50% increase from the beginning of this year. Additionally, we continue to make good progress with the installations and integration of our Commercial customer database. Now turning to DIY Transformation, our third quarter comp store sales grew 1.7%, marking our third consecutive quarter of positive comps, ahead of our original plans despite lower investments. We believe the industry remains favorable for continued DIY growth. Consumers are saving money by maintaining their existing vehicles rather than replacing them and miles driven have also started to grow again. Our DIY market share at the end of the third quarter declined a quarter of a percent compared to the same time last year. Even with our greater focus on Commercial, we believe our lower share in DIY compared to the market in the last two quarters, albeit small, is a trend that we can and will reverse. We have several DIY initiatives that are underway to increase the number of customers that visit our stores, as well as to drive the conversion rate of existing customers. We believe these actions will improve our results and position us to grow share in DIY. I want to briefly touch on a few of those initiatives. In regards to consideration rates, we made significant changes to our marketing program that we believe are now beginning to drive more customer traffic. Last year, we decided to move marketing money out of DIY in order to fund certain initiatives within Commercial and Availability Excellence. This decision was based on the need to redefine our marketing strategy as evidenced by the low returns on our advertising spend and our ability to generate significant returns from investments in both Commercial and Availability Excellence. As a result of this decision, we've spent significantly less in advertising in the second and third quarters compared to the prior year. Our marketing team has now revamped our advertising and marketing programs. Our new DIY advertising was launched in late August and is producing results that meet our expectations. Our spending for the rest of the year will still be basically flat with last year. However, the initial results from the campaign are showing our advertising efforts are much more effective. We're confident that our new strategy and approach will position us well for 2010. In regard to conversion rates, we know we still have a tremendous opportunity in DIY to fulfill the needs of the customers who are visiting or calling our stores each day. To increase our conversion rate, we have been taking several actions. We're installing traffic counters and updated phone systems to measure and drive our conversion rate by store. We're targeting stores with specific R&D efforts to identify sales development opportunities. We're implementing staffing initiatives to ensure we have the right staff in the right place at the right time. We're doing extensive sales development coaching classes across the company. And lastly, to better leverage our parts availability and merchandising improvements, we're implementing initiatives to close the sale. We also have been providing you an update on our Superior Experience strategy over the past several quarters. This strategy is focused on initiatives that will enable us to serve our customers better than anyone else. We're measuring our progress with our Superior Experience strategy through our customer- satisfaction scores. We're pleased to report that our customer-satisfaction scores have increased for both DIY and Commercial over the past year. We have now been collecting the scores for each store for both DIY and Commercial for a full year, so we have established a good baseline for comparison, and we believe we have a great base to build upon. Our current focus is on learning from those stores that have great scores and gaining a better understanding of the stores with low scores and engaging them to ultimately improve performance. Many of the initiatives I have mentioned that are driving our DIY infomercial growth are being rolled to the Superior Experience strategy. Some of our best field leaders are leading the roll out throughout the company in a very disciplined and focused way. These initiatives include improved staffing, field- organization desire to more effectively serve both DIY and Commercial customers, providing sales development and coaching and driving improved gross margins while making better pricing decisions and improving strength control. In closing, thanks again to our team for what you're doing each day to serve our customers and drive our results. We continue to believe we're making solid progress in providing both our Commercial and DIY customers a Superior Experience and look forward to keeping you updated, as we continue with our initiatives. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, Chief Operating Officer, to review our Availability Excellence strategy. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I would also like to congratulate the team on a great quarter. I'd briefly highlight the initiatives to improve our gross profit rate, as well as our key focus areas in Availability Excellence that continue to drive long-term values. During the third quarter, our gross profit rate increased 190 basis points versus the third quarter last year. This reflects our continued progress in improving our availability of parts, the strengthening and developing of our price optimization and merchandising capabilities, decreasing inventory shrink and improving store execution, as a result of the changes that better align Team Member incentives from the beginning of this year. During the quarter, we added two PDQs and 25 HUB stores. PDQs are Parts Delivered Quickly warehouses located in major cities, and HUB stores serve a neighborhood of stores immediately around them with an expanded assortment. We also upgraded the inventories at 389 stores during the quarter, well ahead of our forecast of 250. We were able to reassort 38% of our plan-o-grams using a custom mix tool, bringing the total reassortment to 83% of our plan-o-grams year-to-date With respect to our main distribution centers, we have been working to improve productivity, increase efficiency and ultimately reduce distribution expenses. In order to accomplish this, we have been focused on implementing engineered standards for order selection. I'm pleased to announce that we now have implemented these changes in all eight of our DCs[distribution centers]. Our work to increase the synergy and collaboration between our inventory and merchandising teams, as well as to increase the productivity of our supply chain is paying off. We have been successful in improving our overall parts availability and employing more effective inventory management. We are on track to completely dispose off the slow moving inventory identified in the fourth quarter of last year. Our inventory per store has decreased by 5.4% while our comp sales have increased 4.7%. Our adjusted accounts payable-to-inventory ratio of 59.7% is down slightly versus 60.3% at the end of third quarter of last year, as a result of the favorable impact of the MOOG® and Wagner® inventory build up at the end of third quarter of last year. We remain on track to improve our AP ratio this year, and I continue to see this as an opportunity for future years. Combined with our 190 basis point improvement in gross margin, our gross margin return on inventory improved substantially in the quarter. At this time, I'd like to congratulate Scott Bauhofer and our entire E-commerce team on the October launch of the company's new E-commerce website at The team has been working tirelessly to deliver a virtual store front that delivers on our promise to be the customer experience leader. Our customers can now easily purchase more than 100,000 auto parts and accessories through this user-friendly site around the clock. We will continue to make site enhancements as needed and expect our business-to-business site to go live early in 2010. I would also like to thank our merchandising and IT team on the implementation of our core merchandising system. We are very excited about this new capability as it will strengthen our category performance and drive significant benefits in the future. I am excited that I'm now leading the Autopart International team and happy to report that they turned in another strong performance, with comp store sales gains of 11.9% during third quarter. AI has now opened 27 stores this year and their footprint has expanded to include 13 states from New England down to Florida. Seven of the locations are now co- located in the same building as Advance stores, allowing us to maximize space and test the possibility of more fully leveraging our collective inventory. We are very pleased with the AI team's year-to-date increases in both revenue and profit growth, and we continue to see AI as a key driver in our future growth. In closing, I continue to be encouraged with both the strategic and financial progress of our Availability Excellence strategy. Now let me turn the call over to Mike Norona, CFO, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for the results we achieved in our third quarter. Our team again delivered a strong financial quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: One, provide some financial highlights of our 2009 third quarter. Two, update you on the key financial dimensions of our transformation around growth, profit and value creation. And three, share some insight into how we are thinking about 2010. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter financial results that were primarily driven by the 190 basis point increase in our gross profit rate versus prior year, as a result of our continued strategic investments. Our third quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.65 included $0.04 related to store divestitures. Excluding the impact of the store divestitures, our earnings per share were $0.69 versus consensus estimates of $0.67, or a 19% increase from the third quarter of 2008. On a year-to-date basis, our earnings per share have increased 17% on top of a 16% increase in EPS last year, excluding the $0.15 impact of store divestitures. Some highlights of the quarter include a 4.7% comp store sales increase comprised of 11.8% increase in Commercial and a 1.7% increase in DIY. On a calendar-adjusted basis, our comp store sales increased 5.2%. Our total revenue grew 6.3% during the quarter. During the third quarter, our gross profit rate increased 190 basis points versus last year, primarily due to continued investments in merchandising capabilities, parts availability, decreased inventory shrink and better store execution. We continue to realize the benefits from the investments we've made over the past year. These investments have allowed us to develop new capabilities to improve our assortment, better execute our pricing strategies and better position us from a cost standpoint. Additionally, our store team members continue to respond well to our new incentive structure. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our 167 basis point increase in gross profit rate year-to-date. During the third quarter, our SG&A rate increased 110 basis points, excluding the impact of store divestitures. The 110 basis point increase was driven by higher incentive compensation, increased store labor, continued strategic capability investments to improve our gross profit rate and accelerate our Commercial business and building new areas such as global sourcing and E-commerce. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising expenses and occupancy expense leverage, as a result of our 4.7% comp store sales increase. All in, our operating margin increased 79 basis points during the third quarter after removing the impact of the incremental store divestitures. We have previously shared that 2009 will be another year marked by investments required as part of our turnaround and transformation. While this has manifested itself in our SG&A rate, we are very pleased with the 79 basis point improvement in our operating margin in the third quarter and the 50 basis point increase year-to- date. Free cash flow through the third quarter was $414 million or a 53% increase over last year. This increase was primarily driven by an improvement in working capital management, increased deferred taxes and an increase in net income. Our rent-adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 2.4x, which was in line with our internal target. From a capital structure perspective, we continue to manage the business to a maximum adjusted debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.5x using 6x capitalized rent. During the third quarter, we purchased approximately 880,000 shares of stock for $35 million at an average share price of $40. We remain committed to managing to a maximum rent-adjusted leverage ratio of 2.5x, and we'll continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases. Our third quarter marked our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit Commercial comp sales growth, our third consecutive quarter of positive DIY comps and our fourth consecutive quarter of strong gross profit rate improvements. These results fueled our third consecutive quarter of double-digit operating income and EPS growth on a comparable basis. We are pleased with the $414 million year-to-date cash flow we generated and the fact that we continue to strengthen our balance sheet while making solid progress on our goal to obtain investment-grade ratings. Now I'd like to share with you the progress we are making on the key financial dimensions of our transformation. As we have shared, our strategic investments are being made to accelerate our growth, improve our profitability and increase the value of our company. This will result in improved operating performance and provide a strong financial foundation for future growth. Turning to growth, we have targeted a significant portion of our spending to customer-facing parts of our business. This represents our largest driver of SG&A growth from last year and includes more trucks, drivers, parts pro sales force, inventory upgrade and tools, which are translating directly into increased sales growth. We see an opportunity and remain committed to growing both our DIY and Commercial businesses but also realize growing both will require investment trade-offs at various times. We have seen these in our DIY business performance, as we have made trade-offs to fund our Commercial growth. Over time, we will continue to balance our investments between our two businesses and gauge our performance by increases in sales per square foot and increasing our total market share. At the end of Q3, our sales per square foot grew 5% over last year to $217 and our total business grew 300 basis point in the quarter, greater than the remaining market as reported by NPD [National Parts Depot]. Turning to profit, we continue to make significant strategic investments in our Availability Excellence and Superior Experience strategies. This includes investments in merchandising capabilities and systems, global sourcing, supply-chain capabilities and network, margin drainer improvements, E-commerce and enhanced field incentive programs. While we are seeing the leverage on our SG&A line from these investments, this is more than offset by the gross profit improvements. We are encouraged that our operating income per Team Member increased to over $10,000 on a rolling-quarter adjusted basis, which is the highest level in over three years. This is being driven by our operating margin, which continues to expand as evidenced by our 79 basis points increase during our third quarter. In addition to the progress we're making in growth and profit, we are also focused on value creation. This includes more focus around capital deployment, working capital management and cash flows. We are pleased with our record free cash flow, that was driven by our improved operating performance, improved inventory management, increased deferred taxes and growing supply-chain financing to expand our AP ratio. On a comparable basis, ROIC has increased 100 basis points to 15.1% from 14.1% during the same period last year. This increase reflects a sharper focus on the investments we are making relative to the returns generated. We also are pleased with our debt levels and the impact they're having on our leverage ratios, which tie to our goal of obtaining investment-grade ratings. These value-creation elements build a strong financial foundation platform, create opportunities and position us well to drive future shareholder value. Next, we want to provide you visibility to how we are thinking about 2010. Although we will share our 2010 outlook when we report our fourth quarter earnings in February, we believe it is important to provide a financial preview for 2010. We will continue to expand our store base and anticipate new store openings will increase in 2009 levels for both Advance and Autopart International brands directly on 150 stores. We will continue to make investments to grow our Commercial business and to improve our DIY sales performance versus the market. We also see opportunities for a continued gross profit rate expansion as a result of our previous investments and merchandising and inventory management capability and for our more recent investments in capabilities such as global sourcing. Turning to our cost structure, we do expect that our SG&A growth will decelerate in 2010. While our transformation requires continued investment in key capabilities I just mentioned, we intend to reduce growth in our fixed cost structure while ensuring we get the right yield on flex with our variable cost. For example, we expect to see reduced costs from some of the areas we invested in this year, such as outsourcing goods not for resale and our DC fleet. Additionally, we expect some of the capability initiatives for 2010 in areas such as labor management, commercial operations and field implementation will help us improve our productivity and yield in areas such as labor, our Commercial programs and our variability in our store performance. We also expect that our investment spend will moderate in 2010. Over the past two years, we have been in the highest investment cycle in order to build the foundational strategic capabilities needed to transform our business. While we expect to see a deceleration in spending compared to these higher levels, we are still in a transformation that requires strategic investments in areas such as e-commerce, Commercial and our global sourcing, along with the fact that we will be annualizing partial year investments from 2009. This balanced and sustainable cost structure will position the company to leverage SG&A at lower comp store sales levels in 2010. We believe this investment profile is prudent and it will better position us to deliver on our long-term financial objectives. All in, we see a pathway to improve our operating margins as a result of discontinued gross profit rate expansion and decelerating our SG&A growth. We will share with you more on our 2010 outlook during the fourth quarter earnings release in February 2010. Looking ahead, we continue to be optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. I would like to remind you that over the next two quarters, we will be up against more challenging comparisons. Additionally, in our fourth quarter last year, we had a 53rd week which increased our sales by $88 million and EPS by approximately $0.10. As a result of last year's 53rd week, and as previously shared, we experienced a calendar shift which benefited comp sales in our 2009 first quarter and will result in a 50 basis points and a 70 basis point headwind in the third and fourth quarters of 2009, respectively. In closing, we are pleased with the financial and strategic results we delivered in the third quarter as well as our year-to-date performance. We are proud of our dedicated team members for delivering these results and who are passionately leading our transformation. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now, let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our nearly 51,000 Team Members for delivering another record performance during our third quarter of 2010. Our positive momentum continues to build, and we continue to focus on what matters most to our customers. Our passion around serving our customers and growing our business has enabled us to capitalize on a strong industry fundamental and consumer demand for auto parts. Our Team Members are doing a fantastic job executing our strategies, resulting in a 9.9% increase in comparable store sales during the quarter, our largest quarterly increase in five years. We continue to increase our profitability by growing our gross profit rates 110 basis points during the quarter, which helped drive another quarter of double-digit operating income growth. Our operating income jumped 31% in the quarter compared to a year ago. The favorable market conditions and successful execution of our key initiatives drove an 11.4% increase in total sales. Store sales productivity reached a record $1.7 million per store on a trailing four quarter basis. I am encouraged by the overall customer satisfaction scores, as we strive to differentiate ourselves by leading in service and providing superior availability to our customers. Collectively, the strategic and financial progress is evident in our customer experience and our bottom line results. The past 11 quarters have been squarely focused on becoming more competitive. We have embarked upon a journey to accelerate our Commercial business, which has realized 11 consecutive quarters of double-digit gains in comparable store sales. Our performance in Commercial is the direct result of our investment to better serve our customers through the additions of parts pros, delivery trucks, the right brands and a national sales force. At the same time, we needed to become more competitive in terms of merchandising and supply chain in order to provide our customers with the right products at the right time. Additionally, our operational focus is due in part to our increased efficiency and productivity. For example, inventory upgrades are no longer event-driven but rather simply part of our doing the business. This work has allowed us to serve our customers better, and at the same time, we have expanded our gross profit rate more than 300 basis points since 2007. Through our DIY and Superior Experience strategies, we have been able to reignite our DIY business and improve the in-store experience delivered to our customers, as evidenced by the growth and our customer satisfaction scores over the last several quarters. Jim, Kevin and Mike will provide updates on some of these initiatives later at the call. Our team is the most important factor in Advance's success. Our highly engaged Team Members have a passion for serving our customers. We continue to assess engagement of our Team Members through our team calibration survey, and we recently completed our second survey of the year. I continue to be pleased that those scores are at record levels across the company, which underpin our strong results in 2010. We are excited about what we see in 2011, as we begin the next phase of our plan. We will continue to strengthen our business through our focus on Team Members and customers, while prioritizing differentiation through service and availability. Differentiation will require going into the next level of effectiveness on several key initiatives that have previously rolled out. They key initiatives include global sourcing, our e-commerce platforms for both DIY and Commercial, and our demand-driven labor model and our Commercial customer growth and retention programs. These core capabilities continue to make a difference with customers and to our bottom line. We will further intensify our work around service and availability, while delivering on value propositions that are driving these terrific results. We remain committed to the development of our Team Members. As I have said before, our team and the total collaboration of our team is the most important factor in our goal to lead the industry in service. I would like to take a moment to recognize a member of our team who is truly a collaborative leader, who is dedicated to serving our customers better than anyone else. District manager Ryan Crawford in Arkansas has always been a hands-on model of how to give wow customer service internally and externally. He constantly connects with every Team Member and gets to know them personally, seeking to understand what they expect from their Advance career. He is a true mentor to his entire team and is a proactive coach in terms of collaboration. Ryan is always the leader in training and execution measurements, but always takes extra time and concern in making sure the Team Member translates new material into action. As Ryan leads, the performance with his stores, customer satisfaction scores, as well as team calibration scores have consistently gained momentum and are increasing. These increases our directly tied to his leadership style and the example that he sets for his team. Ryan also possesses high personal standards and is an example of a leader who is living the Advance values and who truly understands our focus on service, as we raise the bar on our commitment to our customers and further grow the development of our team. Thanks, Ryan. And keep up the good work. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to provide a progress update on Commercial Acceleration and DIY transformation strategy. Jim? Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren. And good morning. I want to add my congratulations and thanks to our entire team for another record quarter. We appreciate our team's commitment to providing great customer service and earning their business one customer at a time by living our company value. This quarter was a continuation of the plans we had laid for you in the past few quarters. Our team did a great job executing those plans, as well as capitalizing on the strong industry fundamentals the produced strong results during the quarter. Our total comp store sales grew by 9.9% in the third quarter compared to 4.7% during the same quarter last year. Again, this quarter, we're pleased to achieve an increase on both the number of customer transactions as well as average size of each transactions. Each of our geographic areas produce positive comps in DIY and double-digit comps in Commercial, resulting in a very consistent performance across our company. This marks our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit Commercial comps in our Advanced Auto Parts stores. Commercial now represent 34% of our total sales. Also, our DIY business produced strong growth and achieved our sixth quarter of positive DIY comps in the last seven quarters with solid positive comps each quarter this year. In total, we continued to gain market share here in the quarter. As Darren discussed, our industry fundamentals are the strongest they've been in many years and we believe they will continue to be for some time as vehicles continue to age, miles driven remains stable or grow and economic conditions reinforce the need for consumers to stretch their dollars. Although the impact of weather is normally neutral over a quarter or a year, the sustained heat this summer was certainly a contributor to our sales stream. We always anticipate more uncertainty due the volatile nature of the fourth quarter resulting from the shifting in consumer spending patterns and competing demand for holiday shopping. As we discussed last quarter, we're now in the stage of our transformation where the phase of new initiatives has slowed. We're asking our store teams to focus on fully implementing and executing the key initiatives that will enable us to provide better customer service, which is the key to our success. Our initiatives remain on schedule and are focused on doing fewer things but doing them better is resulting in more consistent execution, strong sales growth in the higher sales per store in our industry. We continue to invest in our store teams to enable them to provide great customer service to both our DIY and Commercial customers. Over the last two quarters, we've successfully implemented the first two phases of customer-driven staffing in our stores. These new staffing tools have been well received by our store teams, and we've achieved significant increases in sales by reallocating our existing labor dollars to better align scheduling with our customer shopping ordering pattern. We've also completed the most Team Member training in our stores this year than ever before. This training is focused on both improving selling skills and enhancing product knowledge, which is enabling our team to better meet our customers' needs. We'll continue to develop and refine additional staffing tools and build on our training and Team Member development focus in 2011. Our Commercial growth continues to be strong, and is supported by the investments we made in parts pro, truck drivers and parts availability, the ramp-up of productivity of our large investment in sales force and what [ph] related tools over the past couple of years. Our focus on growing our relationships with those customers that we can serve best and with which we mutually have the most potential when we partner together and improve operational excellence in our stores so we can consistently order, get orders delivered quickly and accurately. A few areas that Kevin will discuss further continue to be fundamental to our strong sales growth, the increase in parts availability that enables us to do better delivery of the customer experience and our new e-commerce stores, which is bringing more DIY customers to our stores and making it easier for our Commercial customers to do business with us. We're in the early stages of both initiatives, and we look forward to their contribution in 2011. With these initiatives the positive industry fundamentals and the positive feedback from our customers, we're excited about our ability to achieve double-digit growth in our Commercial business and continue to grow our DIY business, as we look forward. Lastly, we continue to reach new customers and grow our sales through successful new store openings. During the third quarter, we opened 43 stores, including 10 Autopart International stores. As of the end of the third quarter, our total store count was 3,540, including 191 Autopart International stores. In closing, thanks again to our talented Team Members for another successful quarter and for achieving those results through a commitment to leading an inspired team and providing great customer service. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim. And good morning. I'd also like to congratulate the team for a strong third quarter. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to strengthen gross profit rate and improve our availability. During the third quarter, our gross profit rate increased 110 basis points versus the third quarter of last year. Third quarter improvement was driven by increases both in front room and back room categories, resulting from the rollout of our custom mix and price optimization strategies, the strengthening of our merchandising capabilities and the impact of our rapidly growing global sourcing capabilities. We continue to be pleased with the strides that have made an improving gross profit rate, which has increased 300 basis points on a two-year basis. Through our custom mixed rollout, we completed approximately 179 upgrades during the quarter. This strategy allows us to improve our in-market availability of parts and accessories and drives improvements in both sales lifts and margin performance. As a result of our improved availability, the comp store sales of hard parts continues to outpace that of our total comp sales and is increasing as a percent of total revenue versus the third quarter of last year. Additionally, we continue to improve category margin rate performance in hard parts. Our sales and margins and accessories are also improved during the quarter, and continues to benefit from our new global sourcing capability. In total, global sourcing continues to have a positive impact on our gross margin in the third quarter. However, we are far from realizing our potential in this capacity. In the third quarter, we continue to improve parts availability through our HUB transportation service and cost improvements and increased our availability through the addition of seven hub stores. Our Delivery HUB Network is at 168, providing multiple deliveries a day to over 2,200 stores, in addition to our 31 PDQs. Year-to-date our DC productivity improvements have increased 12% over last year due to continued focus on labor standards and productivity initiatives. Our adjusted accounts payable to inventory ratio of 71% increased significantly from 61.1% at the end of the third quarter last year. Our increase in the AP ratio continues to be driven by more favorable payment terms, supply-chain financing and the timing of inventory purchases. Our own inventory decreased by nearly $112 million versus last year. The customer perception of product availability continues to increase and exceed our internal expectations. This increased perception is a direct result of our continued focus in commitment to provide superior availability to both our DIY and Commercial customers. As we look forward, we will continue to expand our availability through focus on increasing our overall brand assortment and leverage our expanding forcing capabilities. We will continue to increase the amount of end market available inventory by maximizing the storage capacity of our stores, hubs and PDQs, combined with our efforts to expand our HUB network. Through this work, our inventory levels and inventory per store will increase. However, we remain focused on reducing our own inventory through continued expansion of our AP ratio. We're pleased with the progress of our DIY e-commerce platform with continual increases in all key metrics: Traffic; conversion rates; and sales. We are proceeding of the rollout of our business-to-business e-commerce capabilities, which will be completed in December. We're excited about our B2B capability, as it will enable our Commercial customers to experience Advance in the manner which they prefer, either online or over the phone. Additionally, it will allow us to become more competitive and do business with more and larger bay garaged customers. In the third quarter, AI's revenues grew 22.9%, driven by the net addition of 40 stores over the past 12 months and a positive comp sales performance in the quarter. AI opened 10 new stores during the quarter, bringing our total store count to 191. Year-to-date, we've opened a total of 35 new AI stores and anticipate the opening of three to five more stores in the fourth quarter. Overall, our third quarter was very successful our team [ph] and I'm thrilled by the strategic and financial progress we've made as we focus on providing superior availability. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented Team Members for the strategic progress and fantastic financial results we delivered during the third quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: One, provide some financial highlights of our third quarter performance; two, provide an update on the key to financial dimensions of our transformation; and three, link our third quarter performance to the balance of 2010 and share some insights into how we're thinking about 2011. As you may recall, our fiscal 2009 results included the impact of store divestitures, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.04 during the third quarter last year. I will speak about our year- over-year results versus 2009 on a comparable operating basis, excluding the impact of the 2009 store divestitures, as that provides a more transparent and relevant comparison, which provide a GAAP financial result, as well as comparable operating results in our earnings release. Overall, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter results, as we continue to reach new heights and achieve new milestones in our company's history. Starting with our earnings, our third quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.03 were $0.34 favorable to last year, representing a 49% increase in EPS, excluding the $0.04 impact of store divestitures last year. This was on top of last year's 19% EPS increase. On a GAAP basis, EPS increased 59% or $0.38 over 2009 third quarter results. Our comp store sales increased 9.9% during the third quarter, which was driven by strong DIY performance and our 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit comp sales gains in Commercial. This was on top of a 4.7% comp during the same period last year, representing a 14.6% two year comp store sales increase. Our gross profit rate increased 110 basis points versus last year and continues to be driven by improved merchandising and pricing capabilities, improved parts availability and supply chain efficiencies. The 110 basis point increase was on top of 190 basis points gross profit rate improvement during the third quarter of 2009. Our SG&A rate during the quarter decreased 50 basis points, excluding the impact of store divestitures last year. The 50 basis point decrease was driven by strong comparable store sales, which resulted in leverage of fixed costs and the decelerated pace of net incremental spending on the company's strategic capabilities, partially offset by incremental advertising and increased incentive compensation. Our operating income increased 32% versus the third quarter last year, and our operating income rate increased 160 basis points during the third quarter. Free cash flow through the third quarter was $467.8 million, which represents a $53.8 million increase over last year. This increase was primarily due to our strong growth in net income and reduced net owned inventory. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio increased to 71% from 61.1% last year, as part of our continued focus efforts to reduce our net owned inventory. Overall, we are pleased with our top- and bottom-line performance, which is being driven by strong industry dynamics, previous strategic investments and superior execution by all of our Team Members. We continue to position the company to decelerate the pace of SG&A per store dollar growth, which will position us to leverage expenses at lower comp sales levels in the future. Our performance through our third quarter, as well as our performance over the past three years, reinforces our commitment to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value. We will continue to measure our performance based on these three dimensions. Our progress over the past few years clearly shows we're on the right path. Our commitment to growing our business is reflected in our year-to-date 7.8% increase in comp store sales and our industry-leading sales per store, which on a treading four-quarter basis grew 5% to $1.7 million. Our ability to grow our profitability is marked by consistent and continued gross profit expansion, and an increased operating income rate, which grew 110 basis points and 160 basis points, respectively, during the quarter. On a two-year basis, our gross profit rate and operating margin has expanded by 300 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively. As we look at our ability to drive shareholder value, we are pleased with our 220 basis point increase in ROIC to 17.3%, a 38% increase in economic profit added over the past 12 months and our year-to-date record free cash flow of $467.8 million. This strong performance across-the-board gives us confidence in the strategic choices we have made to greatly increase our operating performance and shareholder value. Our performance is also being recognized externally with our recent upgrade by Moody's to investment-grade. This upgrade, coupled with our previous upgrade by S&P, now brings us to full investment grade status. Getting to full investment grade is the direct result of the positive impact our Team Members are making on growing our business and when combined with our strong balance sheet, provides us a strong financial platform to continue to grow and extract further value in areas such as supply-chain financing. Next, I'd like to make our third quarter performance to what we see for the balance of the year, as well as provide some insights on 2011. As we previously shared, we do not expect the same level of over performance in our fourth quarter. The fourth quarter is our most volatile quarter, given the seasonality shift in the timing of consumer spending and the trade-offs consumers make during the holiday shopping season. We also estimate we will have a $0.10 to $0.12 headwind in our expenses in the fourth quarter, primarily due to incentive compensation resulting from our strong year-to-date performance compared to our soft fourth quarter last year, combined with a deliberate decision to pull forward in 2011 expenses in Commercial and availability into our fourth quarter. This will better position us to carry our momentum into 2011. With our strong third quarter performance and taking these expense headwinds in the fourth quarter into account, we are increasing our fiscal 2010 annual EPS outlook to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.90. Turning to 2011, we expect industry dynamics to remain favorable, which gives us confidence to continue to invest in the customer and Team Member facing parts of our business to drive growth. We anticipate continued top-line growth driven by double-digit Commercial comps and continued new store growth that will be at least at 2010 levels. We expect our availability will continue to generate value through reductions in owned inventory and continued gross profit expansion, however, at more modest levels than 2010. Turning to our cost structure. We expect we will continue to invest in the business in areas such as Commercial, parts availability and e-commerce. That said, we expect our SG&A dollar growth to de- accelerate in 2011, as we somewhat offset these investments spend with productivity enhancements in areas such as labor management and operational efficiencies. This will position the company to leverage SG&A at lower sales comp levels in 2011. Given the momentum in our operational performance, disciplined approach to capital management and strong industry trends, we expect capital spending to increase in 2011, primarily in the areas of availability and store systems. We believe this investment profile best positions the company to build a differentiated service model that delivers on our long-term financial objectives. We look forward to sharing with you a more robust 2011 annual outlook during our fourth quarter conference call. In closing, we are very pleased with our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational and financial performance. Our strategic choices, along with our execution and favorable industry trends, continue to fuel our growth and provide us a solid foundation to continue to grow from and differentiate our business in the eyes of our customers. Again, I would like to thank all of our talented Team Members for their meaningful contributions and record-setting performance through our third quarter. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
159,GV_145977_2011Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Third Quarter 2011 Conference Call. Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Director of Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call.

To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up to the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'd like to thank our 52,000 Advance team members for delivering record results during the third quarter through their dedication and service to our customers. We are pleased with our third quarter results that included strong growth in our commercial sales, along with incremental improvements in our DIY trends. During the quarter, we generated a 2.2% comparable store sales gain, which was on top of a 9.9% comp gain last year. It was our best quarterly sales performance in 2011 on a 2-year basis. Our sales performance continues to be driven by our ability to serve our customers and inspire our team members, as reflected in our improving customer satisfaction scores and consistent operations execution. Now despite the sequential improvement on our sales performance this year, the regional dynamics of our business continue to weigh our overall sales growth in DIY. Nearly 90% of our stores are concentrated east of the Mississippi River. Within those geographies, the pace of industry growth for DIY has slowed by more than 700 basis points versus the rate of growth during the third quarter last year. Comparatively, industry growth for DIY in the western half of the U.S. outpaced the east by more than 300 basis points in the current third quarter. This trend has been consistent the entire year, and we anticipate it will continue in the fourth quarter. However, over the long term, we believe the impacts of regionality could be much less volatile and the industry fundamentals remain solid across the entire U.S. Turning to our profitability. Our team materially improved our performance during the quarter, which is reflected in our 20.8% increase in operating income and our 167-basis point increase in our operating income rate. It was a record 12.1% rate for the third quarter. Our earnings per share also grew significantly to $1.41, an increase of 37% versus the third quarter last year. We are delighted by these results, which reflect our ability to drive solid sales growth while improving and accelerating our profitability through leveraging our investments and adjusting our costs that are not enabling our long-term growth and profitability objectives. In 2010, we developed a blueprint to help us create a more cost-competitive and efficient organization. This work continues to help us streamline and simplify our organizational structure to reduce costs and minimize the impact to sales and our service levels. Overall, our cost management drove our record bottom line results. It is a delicate balancing act, yet the progress we've made over the past year is encouraging. Mike will provide more specifics on the financial impact of that work. The focus of our investments and strategies have been aimed at providing a better and different customer service experience than our competition. This intense focus on our values and our promise, Service is our best part, combined with strong industry dynamics has allowed us to increase our overall return on invested capital to 18.8%. As a company, we will continue to be focused on the fundamentals of our business and reaping the rewards of running the business with consistency and excellence. This year, we began the work to be the leader in service and putting in place foundational service and operations excellence at every store. We began that work by increasing the number of district leader positions to allow for more focused coaching and development within our stores. We have also begun to roll out tools and training that better enable us to understand both the quantity and the quality of our team members and appropriately match them with the times of day when our customers shop with us most. We will continue to prioritize service leadership through accelerating our commercial growth and igniting our talented team members with training and tools to serve our customers better. We will continue to benefit from our delivery and online ordering capabilities that allow us to fulfill our customers' needs with speed, reliability and consistency. Our investment hub stores and our work to maximize storage capacity for parts in our stores continue to allow us to strengthen our in-market availability while leveraging our larger box sizes. We also continue to make progress on opening our new Remington DC, which will allow us to create much-needed capacity to fill the demands of our customers. Selectively, our strategy has positioned us to increase our availability as well as the service level and productivity of every team member through increased customer engagement and service excellence. Before I close, I want to share a story about a team member who exemplifies what Service is our best part means to Advance Auto Parts. Alice Hodgkins, [ph] the Assistant General Manager in the store in Staunton, Virginia, has been with the company for over 40 years. District Leader, Bob Bratcher says, she exemplifies the difference between transactions and interactions by creating interactions and truly forming relationships with her customers. Alice's attitude and enthusiasm at work as she serves each and every customer with a smile on her face, is very inspiring to her coworkers. Fellow team members say that they respect Alice for the way in which she takes care of each customer from start to finish. And she has set that bar high in store customer service. Alice backs up her positive personality with extreme parts knowledge and makes sure she gets enough information for the customers to fully satisfy their needs. I commend Alice for her personal commitment and passion for service in the store and in her community as she strives to live the Advance value every day with every customer. Congratulations, Alice, and keep up the great work. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to discuss our service leadership strategy. Jim? Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I'll start by saying thank you to our team for the record sales and profit results we're reporting this morning. Our continued commitment to inspiring our teams and serving our customers better than anyone else directly led to our higher sales and higher productivity during the third quarter. In addition to record sales and profits, our customer satisfaction scores rose again this quarter. Our total comp store sales grew by 2.2% in the third quarter, which is on top of our record-setting 9.9% increase during the same quarter last year. The third quarter represented our toughest comp comparison for the year, and we're pleased with how our team responded to the challenge. We continue to outperform the market and gain significant market share in our rapidly growing Commercial business, which represented 37.2% of our total sales in the third quarter compared to 34.6% during the third quarter last year. We continue to see significant potential to grow our Commercial business and to gain market share. We again saw some short-term impact of customers performing only the necessary repairs on their vehicles and delaying maintenance from both a DIY and Commercial perspective. This continues to be driven by the high unemployment rate and high gas prices, which are constraining consumer spending and driving habits. However, vehicles continue to age, which is creating greater repair needs because of the higher number of average miles per vehicle. Gas prices have moderated somewhat, and deferred repairs will be performed overtime as they always have. These factors will allow us to continue to grow well into the future. Our DIY business remained somewhat challenging. However, we continue to see sequential improvement in DIY, and our third quarter growth was our best thus far this year. And again, this is on top of our toughest comp comparison for the year. Our work to provide our store teams more tools to increase their development, coaching and training, our teams' focus and energy to serve our customers better, continued parts availability increases and refined marketing and advertising initiatives are making a difference. While we have seen some sequential improvement in DIY, we still have our teams to grow and improve. We've shared with you over the last several quarters our work to continue to strengthen our store staffing model. Our initiatives have been focused on having the right people at the right time to align with the traffic patterns of both our DIY and commercial customers. The next phase of this work is to ensure we have the highest quality of engagement within each stores during the times when our customers visit and call our stores most. Our efforts have yielded increases in our productivity, and allowed us to be more flexible and better respond to business demand. We continue to see great results from this work, and we'll continue to refine it over time to ensure we have both the appropriate quality and quantity of staffing to better serve our customers and achieve higher productivity levels. Our focus will also continue to be on our training and development, further measuring our progress with respect to our staffing model, increasing our productivity through maximizing our previous investments and focusing on the consistent execution of those fundamentals that our customers value most. Lastly, we continue to reach new customers and grew our sales through successful new store openings. During the third quarter, we opened 20 stores and closed 2 stores. Year-to-date, we've opened 85 stores. As of the end of our third quarter, our total store count was 3,645, including 203 Autopart International stores. In closing, I'd like to again thank our team as they continue to serve our customers and achieve record sales and profits. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss our superior availability strategy. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their hard work in the third quarter. I'll take a moment to update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy and highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter. Our goal is to provide customers with superior availability, providing the right parts to our customers, our customers' needs when they need them. In order to achieve our goal, we've been working to better position our parts inventory to ensure both speedy and accurate deliveries. Our hub store strategy is key to achieving that goal. Our work in this space has been twofold, increasing the number of hubs in the marketplace, as well as providing delivery capability from strategically positioned hubs. As a result, we worked to aggressively add a number of hub stores that provide daily deliveries, which now sits at 252, or an increase of 79 since Q3 2010. During third quarter, we upgraded inventory in 116 stores and 767 year-to-date. As a result of our efforts to add hub stores and to maximize store-level capacity, our in-stock levels were up nearly 100 basis points over last year and are at a record high. Our inventory positions during the quarter were up 14.7% versus the third quarter of last year. We continue to expect our total inventory growth to be in the low double digits for the year. We continue to work aggressively to manage our inventory investment -- our increased investment in inventory and have been able to reduce our owned inventory per store by nearly 5% due to our work to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio. Our work in this space has led to an increase in our AP ratio of roughly 420 basis points versus the third quarter of last year and now, stands at 75.2%. We are very proud of the accomplishments made, and we'll continue to work to expand our AP ratio in the future. Turning to gross profit. Our gross profit rate declined 87 basis points to 49.5% versus the third quarter of last year. This anticipated decline was driven by several factors. First, our gross profit rate continues to be impacted by unfavorable shrink. Our teams continue to work diligently to get back to the high level of asset protection achieved over the past couple of years. Second, our supply chain costs continue to be a headwind as a result of increased fuel prices, increased hubs and deliveries. Finally, our margins were impacted by the commodity and price inflation and the related timing of our retail price changes. Partially offsetting these headwinds were a continued improvement in DC productivity and continued benefits from our merchandising, global sourcing and pricing capabilities. We are on pace to open our Remington, Indiana DC during the second quarter of 2002. The new DC will provide us with much-needed capacity and will be by far our most advanced DC within our distribution network. Once this new DC is up and running, we'll be able to benefit from additional productivity improvements and continue to increase our overall availability. Our B2C Internet platform is celebrating its second full year of operations, and we have been absolutely delighted with the progress we've made. We continue to increase the number of customers who visit the site and the amount of transactions they generate. I want to congratulate our E-Commerce team on their efforts to build a world-class online shopping experience for our customers. From a B2B Internet standpoint, we continue to perform above expectations and are working diligently to add customers to the site. This capability allows us to compete more effectively and ultimately provides the convenience and service levels our customers expect. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their contributions to the financial outcomes we delivered during our third quarter of 2011. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide some financial highlights from our third quarter of 2011; two, put our third quarter results into context with the key financial dimensions that we use to measure our performance; and three, share with you what we see for the remainder of 2011 and insights into how we are thinking about 2012. During the third quarter, our revenue increased 4.2%, driven by 105 net new stores over the past 12 months and a comp store sales increase of 2.2%, which was on top of a 9.9% comp store sales gain during the third quarter last year. As both Darren and Jim mentioned, we are very pleased with the growth as our third quarter represented our most challenging comparison for the entire year. We also experienced strong growth from Autopart International, which grew 17.4% over the third quarter last year. As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate in the third quarter was 49.5% versus 50.3% in the third quarter last year, or a decrease of 87 basis points. This was in line with our expectations. The decline versus prior year was driven by increased shrink, increased supply chain expenses due to investments in hubs, higher fuel costs and commodity price inflation combined with the timing of retail price changes. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate decreased slightly by 19 basis points to 49.9%. Our decrease in gross profit rate was in line with our previous outlook provided during our second quarter conference call. As previously shared, we anticipate our full year gross profit rate will be down modestly compared to last year. This anticipates our fourth quarter gross profit to be down from prior year, but the decline is expected to be less than the decline in the third quarter. Turning to our cost structure. Our SG&A rate was 37.3% during the third quarter versus 39.9% during the third quarter of 2010. This 254-basis point decrease was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation as a result of our lower comp store sales growth versus last year, productivity improvements from our variable customer-driven labor model, which includes anniversary and investment rollout expenses, as well as a significant decrease in support costs from our operating model work. Partially offsetting this was increased investments in areas such as commercial and e-commerce, combined with the timing of some expenses. Based on our diligent cost management and commitment to building a more competitive cost structure, we now anticipate our SG&A per store to be down slightly for the full year. All in, our operating income grew 20.8%, and our operating income rate increased 167 basis points to 12.1% for the quarter. This was on top of last year's 32% increase in operating income and 160-basis point improvement in operating income rate. Year-to-date, our operating income has increased 10.3% and on a rate basis, has increased 65 basis points to 11.4%. Our third quarter diluted EPS increased 36.9% to $1.41 versus $1.03 last year. Year-to- date, our diluted EPS is up 24.3% on top of last year's 29.1% comparable EPS increase. Free cash flow through the third quarter was $354.8 million versus $467.9 million last year. The decrease in free cash flow was driven primarily by the change in owned inventory this year to date versus last year, as well as higher planned capital expenditures. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio increased 420 basis points to 75.2% as of the third quarter of 2011 from 71% versus the same period last year as part of our continued efforts to reduce our net owned inventory. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our stock for $100 million at an average price of $58.81 per share. Through the third quarter, we have repurchased approximately 9.9 million shares of stock at a cost of $609.6 million at an average price of $61.51 per share. These repurchases continue to be reflective of our confidence in our company's ability to grow profitably and to create long- term shareholder value. As of the end of the third quarter, we have $200 million remaining under our current $300 million authorized share repurchase program. Strategically, we continue to position the company for growth and improve profitability, and we are delighted by these financial results as they demonstrate our commitment to growth and improved profitability. Our performance in our third quarter demonstrates we are on the right path and reinforces our commitment to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value. We continue to measure our performance based on these 3 dimensions. Our commitment to growing our business is reflected by another strong quarter of commercial comp store sales growth. Our commercial sales per program have grown to $630,000, and over the past 3 years have increased 47% or $200,000 per store. We remain committed to growing our sales per store and improving our operating income rate to 12% over the next few years. Our third quarter results provide evidence that we can improve our profitability given our 160-basis point improvement -- 167-basis point improvement in operating income rate to 12.1% and our year-to-date operating income rate of 11.4%. On a 2-year basis, our operating income rate is up over 325 basis points. Turning to shareholder value. We continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital as reflected in our 18.8% return on invested capital, which represents an increase of 147 basis points over the third quarter last year and a 440-basis point improvement over the past 3 years. The increase in ROIC is driven by our improved operating performance as well as our continued efforts to reduce our owned inventory. Next I would like to link our third quarter performance to what we see for the balance of 2011, as well as provide some insights on 2012. While we are very pleased in our ability to rebound from our difficult start to the year and deliver sequential increases in operating income growth in both the second and third quarters, we certainly do not expect the same level of improvement versus prior year in our fourth quarter. We are cautiously optimistic about the remainder of the year, given our fourth quarter has a challenge in comparison to last year, and historically is the most volatile quarter given the changes in weather, seasonality shift in the timing of consumer spending and the trade-offs consumers make during the holiday shopping season. That said, given our strong third quarter, we now anticipate our annual EPS outlook to be $4.90 to $4.95. Achieving this outcome in 2011 will result in another 20%-plus increase in EPS and over 20% compounded annual EPS growth over the past 4 years on a comparable basis. As we look to 2012, we will continue to build on our growth and profit successes over the past several years. We expect the industry dynamics to remain favorable as a result of the continued increase in the average age of vehicles and an increase in mix of vehicles that are 7 to 10-plus years old. This gives us confidence to invest in the customer and team member-facing parts of our business to continue to drive growth. We anticipate continued top line growth driven by our strong commercial comps, combined with continued new store growth, to be at least at 2011 levels. We expect to continue to build on our progress to achieve our goal of 12% operating margins over the next few years. We expect the drivers to getting the 12% will primarily come through a more competitive cost structure and modest gross profit expansion from where we are today. As we have previously shared, we are delighted by the significant improvements we've made in our gross profit rate over the past 3 years and firmly believe that the structural drivers of our gross profit rate remain intact. We continue to see opportunities to improve our gross profit rate, driven by the expansion of our global sourcing business and private label strategy, improvements in our shrink performance and through future supply chain productivity improvements. These structural drivers will help offset headwinds as a result of an increasing mix of commercial business, as well as inflationary and competitive pressures. Turning to our cost structure. We are focused on building a more efficient, sustainable and competitive cost structure. As we have shared, our operating model work is multi-year work and reflects the opportunities we see to increase our productivity, reduce our variability of store performance and our continued efforts to reduce support cost furthest away from the customer. We expect to continue the great progress we made in 2011. Our growth ambitions will require us to continue to make investments in areas such as commercial, global sourcing and e-commerce, and these investments will be primarily funded through our efforts to improve our cost structure and simplify our operating model. In closing, our strong results during the third quarter continue to be a reflection of our teams' commitment to serve our customers. Our strategic choices, teams' execution and favorable industry dynamics continue to fuel our growth and give us confidence about the future. Again, I would like to thank all of our talented team members for their contributions to our third quarter results and for their unwavering commitment to grow our business through our Service is our best part promise while improving our profit model. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
160,GV_145977_2012Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And today's call is being recorded. Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Director of Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call. Joshua Moore Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the Safe Harbor Provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements address future events, developments or results and typically use words, such as believe, anticipate, expect, intent, will, plan, forecast, outlook or estimate, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause the results to differ materially, including competitive pressures, demand for the company's products, the economy in general, consumer debt levels, dependence on foreign suppliers, the weather, business interruptions and other factors disclosed in the company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. The reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at advanceautoparts.com. Also I'd like to remind you that it is our company's policy to not comment on rumors and/or speculation, and we continue to follow that policy throughout this call. For planning purposes, our fourth quarter earnings release is scheduled for February 7, 2013, before market open, and our quarterly conference call scheduled for the morning of Thursday, February 7, 2013. To be notified of the future dates of our earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for 1 year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Thanks, for joining us, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our 54,000 team members for their hard work and focus on delivering great customer service. Their determination provided us much-needed momentum during the quarter. As you've seen in our earnings release and as we indicated in our prerelease last month, our business and industry continues to face weak consumer demand in both DIY and Commercial. Additionally, we continue to be impacted by varied geographic performance with softer sales performance in our cold weather markets. Consumers still face high gas prices, which increased $0.49 a gallon since July and averaged $3.73 a gallon during the quarter. We believe this volatility in higher fuel costs definitely played a role in consumer behavior and spending in the quarter. As we stated in our second quarter call, we anticipated that the market would be challenging and that demand would continue to be weak. However, our focus has been to improve our sales trajectory in the face of near-term decelerating trends in our industry. As a result of these efforts, our comparable store sales accelerated nearly 100 basis points from the second quarter to the third. Our quarter-over-quarter improvement was principally driven by our Commercial Business, with accelerating comp sales growth each period during the quarter for our Advance stores. Our Commercial business had improving trends in both transactions and ticket. Our third quarter transaction growth sequentially improved throughout the quarter. While our average ticket in Commercials still faced declines year-over-year, the decline was more moderate versus our second quarter. Similar to our second quarter, the average ticket decline was principally driven by a mix of products sold, namely, the impact of weaker maintenance category sales and higher promotions. Further impacting the average ticket has been lower inflation in some key seasonal categories, like AC in the absence of escalating oil prices. From a geographical perspective, we continue to see weakness and volatility in our cold weather markets, especially in the Great Lakes and the Northeast regions. Our performance in those 2 markets continues to be impacted by the lingering effects of last year's warmer weather -- let's say, this year's warmer weather. Our comparable store sales declines continue to trail our total company average by several hundred basis points. However, we've seen our comps accelerate in the Northeast roughly 300 basis points from the second quarter and by nearly 130 basis points in the Great Lakes. This is very encouraging and is a testament to the will and determination of our teams operating in those areas. We continue to post positive comps in our Western markets, where we only have 10% of our store base. Despite the improvements in our business during the quarter, our comp store sales decreased 1.8%. We believe that the industry will remain soft for the balance of the year. However, we believe we will continue to carry our momentum from the third quarter into Q4, provided we see a reasonable bounce back from the effects of Hurricane Sandy. The improvements we've made in the second quarter came with a cost. Our result to work to deliver higher results than our trends suggested as we exited Q2 compelled us to increase the customer facing and traffic-driving elements in our business. This included increased labor and advertising expense, as well as more targeted promotions. Our increase in labor was focused on providing better service levels to our Commercial customers and coverage during the weekends were we have significant opportunity to better serve our customers. We invested in labor to position us to get back to positive comps. Our advertising spend was focused on driving our battery business in anticipation of increased demand as a result of record heat this summer, which we expect to be a catalyst for demand over the next 6 months. Our battery sales performance was very strong, with roughly 200 basis points of comp acceleration from Q2 to Q3. As a result of increased spending to improve our trends, our operating income decreased $27.5 million to $150.4 million. Clearly, this was lower than we planned. As our full year outlook suggests, we will adjust our costs in the fourth quarter to more closely align with the previous planned spend profile. As I previously mentioned, we made specific investments in the quarter to position us to capitalize on the underlying fundamentals of our industry, which remained positive. Our focus will continue to be to provide our customers with reliable service, increased delivery speed and superior availability, which has propelled our Commercial gain and is critical to our DIY success. Our investments and priorities have been centered on those outcomes. Our progress on our initiatives this year will provide us with momentum for the future. The mission-critical outcomes in the third quarter included completing the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program, shipping from our new distribution center of Remington, Indiana and the expansion into the boroughs of New York. In closing, I want to share a story about Jim Nevins [ph], a commercial parts pro in Dacula, Georgia. Jim is a shining example of how we're striving to consistently deliver fast reliable service to our Commercial customers. Jim is more than just dedicated. He truly takes ownership and is fully invested in helping his customers be successful. Having managed a shop himself, he understands that relationships create a 2- way street. His general manager says that Jim creates true value for his customers and for the advanced brand. He sees no obstacles when locating what his customers need. He only sees challenges. Jim not only finds satisfaction from accomplishing the feat at hand, he finds an even greater reward when he knows that he has solved someone's problem and has helped that individual to be successful. He uses every resource available from the Internet to local suppliers to make sure our customers are satisfied. Jim's customers know the quality of his service and his ability to find anything they need. Jim's dedication to Advance and to his customers is truly inspiring. His drive and unwillingness to accept failure differentiates his level of service from the competition. Jim, thanks, and keep up the great work. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin? Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their hard work in the third quarter. I'll provide updates on the work that occurred during the quarter as well as update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy and new store growth. Despite the current softness in some of our major markets we operate in, we continue to focus on providing our customers with the best end market availability and consistency of service, both in order accuracy and delivery speed. As I'll share with you, our focus continues to be on the expansion of our hub network, the continuous upgrade of our parts in our non-hub stores, the opening of our new DC and the implementation of our daily replenishment capability, and the continued growth and rollout of our B2C and B2B e-commerce platforms, commercial diagnostic tool and our electronics part catalog. During the quarter, we continue to expand our hub network through new store expansion in the upgraded existing stores, which are strategically positioned to operate as a hub. Our focus continues to be on strengthening our availability of both maintenance and failure parts, as demand for these products will increase as the average age of vehicle increases. During the quarter, we added 8 additional hub stores, bringing our hub store count to 328 versus 288 at the end of the third quarter last year. We also upgraded inventory at 363 non-hub stores during the quarter. As scheduled, we've begun our first outbound shipments in September from our new distribution center in Remington, Indiana. As I mentioned before, we're very excited about this new facility as it will be used for a model for our future in terms of automation, which will greatly improve our productivity and allow us to replenish our stores daily. This new facility will ship product to our stores in phases, ramping up to over 400 stores next year and provide daily replenishment to over 200 stores. The initial results at Remington have been good, and we're achieving our rollout plans. Although we're very early in the process, we're extremely excited about the prospects and will continue to work aggressively to ensure we get the planned benefits. As a result of these upgrades and opening of our new distribution center, our total inventory increased 4% to roughly $2.2 billion. We anticipate our total inventory will continue to grow over time as we focus on increasing the breadth of our parts assortment and improving our positioning with larger Commercial customers. At the same time, we continue to work aggressively to free up capital to fund other parts of our business through our supply chain financing program. As a result of that work, we continue to expand our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which increased roughly 803 basis points from 75.2% at the end of the third quarter last year to 83.2% this year. As a direct result, we've reduced our own inventory by nearly 30%, a decrease of $155.5 million from $523.7 million to $368.2 million. Turning to e-commerce. We continue to focus on growing our business through expanded penetration of our B2B capabilities to our Commercial customers. We've rolled out our B2B online ordering capabilities, and we expect to continue to increase the B2B penetration over time. This will allow us to increase both the frequency and retention rate of our Commercial customers who utilize this capability. Additionally, we continue to broaden our ability to provide more value-added services to our Commercial customers through MotoLogic, our shop diagnostic capability and DriverSide, which allows us to provide services aimed at helping our Commercial -- our customers grow their business. These capabilities will allow us to be a much stronger partner for our customers and make it easier and more compelling to them to do business with us. Finally, with respect to e-commerce, we continue to make great progress with our B2C site, and I'm proud to announce that we now have the #1 multichannel site in the markets we serve. This is a great feat and reflective of the team's hard work and strength of our brand and online capability. We will continue to enhance our mobile commerce business and increase the level of convenience for our DIY customers. We continue to focus on our new store opening strategy with an emphasis of building out more commercially oriented stores and expanding in markets within our current footprint that remain under penetrated. During the third quarter, we opened 35 stores, including 7 Autopart International stores. Year- to-date, we've opened 70 stores, including 13 Autopart International stores and closed 5. As of October 6, 2012, our total store count was 3,727, including 210 Autopart International stores. Our class of new stores continues to perform very well and is proving to be our most successful class in terms of sales productivity and the pace of their weekly sales ramp. Additionally, we began opening our first stores within New York City and anticipate opening roughly 18 stores in New York City this year. The entry into this very large market is an important milestone for us. For the year, we remain on pace to open approximately 120 to 140 stores, including the expected addition of roughly 65 stores in Q4 and are building our pipeline that allow us to open approximately 180 to 200 stores next year. Finally, we focused on reversing our decelerating sales trends, and as a result, strengthened our competitive pricing position and increased our promotional activity during the quarter. However, our gross profit rate increased 31 basis points to 49.8% versus 49.5% during the third quarter of 2011. The increase was driven by our continued efforts to improve our shrink, cost deflation and supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by increased promotional activity during the quarter. Year-to-date, our growth -- gross profit rate was 49.9%, which is essentially flat during the same period in fiscal 2011. We will still remain on track to modestly improve our gross profit rate for the year. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in more detail. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers as we navigated through a challenging third quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide some financial highlights from our third quarter of 2012; two, put our third quarter and year-to-date results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, share with you what we see for the remainder of 2012 and insights into how we are thinking about 2013. As we shared in our October 22 prerelease of our preliminary financial results, our third quarter performance continued to reflect ongoing softness in our colder winter markets driven by the lingering impact of this year's milder winter. In addition, our tough economic environment continues to impact consumer demand for auto parts as evidenced by softness in both our maintenance and failure categories. While sales trends improved from our second to third quarter, we did not achieve our profitability expectations. Our profitability shortfall was driven by deliberate decisions to improve sales trends and position the business to capitalize on the solid industry fundamentals we see. We targeted areas such as store labor and seasonal advertising to get back to positive comps sales growth and improve our market share. We also stayed the course with our planned investments in areas such as Remington DC and commercial credit in-sourcing launches, inventory upgrades and more aggressive store opening plans, including our new market entry into New York City, which is part of our new store opening plan in the fourth quarter. While we did not achieve internal expectations, we were encouraged by our sales improvement from our second to third quarter, primarily driven by improvements in our Commercial comps and the fact that we were able to accelerate our sales performance, while the industry decelerated from the second to third quarter. Our decision to trade off profitability in the short term is driven by our confidence in the industry fundamentals and ensuring we position the company for 2013 with momentum as we expect a more normal winter. Third quarter sales decreased 0.5% to nearly $1.5 billion, driven by our comp store sales decrease of 1.8%, partially offset by the net addition of 82 new stores over the past 12 months. Year-to-date, our total sales increased 0.7% to $4.9 billion, and our Comp store sales decreased 0.5%. As Kevin mentioned, our third quarter gross profit rate increased 31 basis points to 49.8% versus 49.5% in the third quarter of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by improvements in shrink, cost deflation and supply chain expenses due to labor productivity, partially offset by an increase in promotional activity. Year-to-date, our Commercial mix represented 38.2% of our 2012 sales versus 37.1% in Q3 of 2011. Year-to-date, our gross profit rate is flat to last year. Our SG&A rate of 39.4% increased 213 basis points versus the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to increased spending on in-store labor and advertising and expense deleverage as a result of our 1.8% comp store sales decline. Year-to-date, our SG&A rate increased 25 basis points to 38.8% versus 38.5% over the same period last year. I outlined the principal drivers of the SG&A change earlier in my comments. All in, our third quarter operating income dollars decreased 15.4%, and our operating income rate decreased 182 basis points to 10.3%. Our diluted EPS decreased 14.2% to $1.21 versus $1.41 last year. Year-to-date, our operating income dollars decreased 1.6% to $544.1 million, and our diluted EPS increased 3.6% to $4.34. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $298.6 million, down $56.2 million over the same period last year. The largest driver of the decrease in free cash flow was an increase in our accounts receivable as a result of our in-sourcing of our commercial credit program. As Kevin mentioned, our owned inventory decreased 29.7% from third quarter 2011, driven by our continued efforts to increase our accounts payable inventory ratio, which now stands at 83.2% versus 75.2% in the third quarter of 2011. At the end of the third quarter, we had $479.4 million in cash and $600.2 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x, which is well below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. Our average diluted share count was 74.1 million shares at the end of the third quarter. As we've mentioned, our industry continues to face weaker consumer demand and softness in the colder weather markets, both of which are impacting our results and contributing to the overall industry deceleration. However, we believe these dynamics are not indicative of a longer-term market slowdown. Specifically, the deferred maintenance reached a record $68 billion according to the most recent industry data. We believe the industry fundamentals remains solid and are encouraged by our team's ability to improve our sales trends from the second quarter. We continue to measure our performance through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. As we have consistently communicated, we prioritized growth as our primary use of capital to increase shareholder value, which includes investing in strategic initiatives to improve our performance and looking for future growth opportunities. Accordingly, there will be periods of time when we preserve capital as we assess sales growth opportunities to create value for our business and shareholders. Over the past few quarters, we have been assessing some sales growth opportunities. At the end of our third quarter, we had roughly $500 million left under our share repurchase authorization, and we plan to continue our historical practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares in a disciplined manner over time. Turning to profit. We remain committed to improving our profitability, which requires both delivering on our sales growth goals, primarily driven by Commercial, and continuing on our journey to develop a more cost competitive operating model. Improving our profitability requires that we do both. Given the softness in our top line and our deliberate decisions to increase customer traffic with increased advertising and labor, in the short term, our profitability growth has been constrained. We are not satisfied with these results and remain committed to improving our profit model by continuing to invest in both Commercial and availability to drive the top line, while more effectively managing our cost structure. As we looked at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.9%. ROIC increased modestly from our third quarter last year, driven by efforts to decrease our owned inventory, despite increasing our average inventory per store. Our AP ratio at the end of the third quarter was a record 83.2%, and we remain focused on achieving an AP ratio of 100% over time. Turning to the balance of the year. We anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging with our cold weather markets still underperforming our total company average comp store sales by several hundred basis points. Additionally, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter, as we compete with holiday shopping season and lower demand for parts. We continue to expect our annual comp store sales to be slightly down for 2012 and anticipate that our gross profit rate will improve modestly for the full year. While we expect to see a more normal winter, this will show up in the first half of next year, and therefore, we expect our cost to deleverage during our fourth quarter given the expected sales decline. We will continue to adjust our variable costs to business trends, but plan to invest in our strategic areas, such as Commercial and availability to our previously planned levels, so we position ourselves with momentum for 2013. As a result, we continue to expect our SG&A per store to be down 1% to 2% for 2012. As a result of our third quarter earnings performance and what we see for the fourth quarter, we anticipate our annual 2012 EPS to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.15 per share. As we look to 2013, we will continue to build on our growth and profit successes over the past 5 years. We expect industry dynamics to remain favorable as a result of the continued increase in the average age of vehicles and the continued increase in the number of vehicles greater than 7 years old. We anticipate a return to more normal weather patterns and expect our top line growth to be driven by stronger Commercial comps, continued improvements in our availability and an accelerated pace of new store growth in the range of 180 to 200 stores. We expect to improve our profitability, driven by a modest improvement in our gross profit rate and through reductions in our SG&A through our continued focus on building a more competitive cost structure and by leveraging a better top line. We will provide a more detailed 2013 annual outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. In closing, we were disappointed we did not deliver the financial results we expected in our third quarter. We are also realistic about the challenging environment and the short-term impact it is having on our business. We believe the current industry softness will continue to put short-term pressure on our fourth quarter earnings. We remain committed and focused on our strategies, and we have confidence in our team's ability to improve our performance. As they have shown many times, when faced with adversity, they always respond with character, resiliency and a competitive spirit. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I'd like to make one final comment. I am sure you have seen recent press reports about our company. I would like to repeat Joshua's comments and remind you that it is our company policy to not comment on rumors and/or speculation. And we will continue to follow that policy as we address your questions. We will be happy to answer your questions regarding our business operations, strategic initiatives and financial results. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
161,GV_145977_2013Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Before we begin, Zaheed Mawani, Director of Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward- looking statements that will be made on this call. Zaheed Mawani Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call.

The reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at advanceautoparts.com. For planning purposes, our fourth quarter 2013 earnings release is scheduled for Thursday, February 6, 2014, before the market opens. And our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, February 6, 2014. To be notified of the dates of the future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for 1 year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Zaheed. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'd like to start off by thanking our 54,000 team members for their hard work and commitment to better serve our customers and grow our business. Joining me on the call today is our President, George Sherman, who'll provide you with an update on our 2013 priorities; and Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer, who will update you on our financials. As you're aware, 2 weeks ago we announced that we entered into an agreement to acquire General Parts. We are excited about this transaction and the opportunity it presents for both organizations' shareholders and over 70,000 team members. As we said, this combination will position Advance as the largest automotive aftermarket provider of parts, accessories, batteries and maintenance items in North America. Strategically, it provides us with a compelling opportunity to expand our geographical presence, channels of distribution and commercial capabilities to better serve customers and deliver value to shareholders. We anticipate the closing of the transaction late this year or early in 2014. Lastly and importantly, due to the pending close of the transaction, we will limit our comments relative to the General Parts acquisition to the information that we have already shared publicly. Now let's review our third quarter results and the work our team has been doing and will continue to do as we move forward. Our total sales increased 4.3% for the third quarter. And earnings per share increased 17.4%. While we are pleased with our earnings performance, we are not satisfied with our 2% comparable store sales decline. The decline was driven by our DIY business and partially offset by a modest increase in our commercial sales. The sequential decline in our business from the second quarter results was, however, consistent with the slowdown in the overall market growth. The overall market continues to face headwinds from a backdrop of limited consumer spending as the consumer appraisal of the economic conditions continues to affect consumer confidence. Specifically, the market softness we witnessed in July and early August continued through the third quarter. We continue to deal with several unfavorable macro factors, including a very apprehensive consumer that is navigating uncertainty with our government, healthcare reform and a very uneven economic recovery. The result is consumers are only performing repairs that are absolutely necessary to keep their vehicles on the road. Consequently, deferred maintenance remains at record levels. The short-term volatility is evident as the overall aftermarket growth slowed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Additionally, looking within Advance's competitive set, we continue to see our competitors intensifying their efforts to drive growth, resulting in more new stores in our footprint. This proliferation of stores and commercial programs in this slow growth period dilutes sales, with over 80% of the new store growth from our competitors occurring in our footprint over the last 12 months. Our comparable store sales shortfall was offset by improvements in our gross margin and disciplined expense control in the quarter as we proactively managed the business and made the necessary adjustments to conform to the market. The team effectively managed our gross profit rate to 50.2%, which was 42 basis points greater than Q3 last year despite continuing headwinds from the full operations of our new Remington distribution facility and the acquisition of BWP, which has a higher mix of commercial sales. Similarly, our diligent expense management resulted in an SG&A rate of 39% in the quarter. The rate improved 49 basis points in the third quarter versus Q3 last year. We saw improvements across numerous areas of the business. Notably, we saw lower administrative and support costs, lower marketing expenses and improved labor productivity while absorbing higher incentive costs versus a year ago. In addition to the consumer macro factors I discussed earlier, we are witnessing structural change within the industry. We continue to see divergence in the growth patterns between DIY and commercial markets. Even looking at current market trends, we see a variance differential. Specifically, the market deceleration from Q2 to Q3 this year was led by a 400 basis point decline in DIY versus a 200 basis point decline in commercial amid the continuing consumer concerns. Looking ahead, we believe the addressable commercial market is $40 billion, which is nearly double the size of the addressable DIY market and growing at 2x the rate of DIY. In response to these macro factors and structural market shifts, we are managing our business forward accordingly. First, we are matching our expenses to the economic conditions within the industry. More specifically, we are managing our cost to the slower sales environment and making pragmatic trade-offs as we balance profitable management of our important DIY business while following the consumer and market trends by continuing to invest in commercial. Second, we continue to evolve our business to the market trends and make specific investments to capitalize on the fundamentals of our industry, which remain positive. I'll speak more about this in a moment. Our strategy over the last 6 years has targeted growth of our commercial business through a series of deliberate stair steps. Our strategic intent hasn't changed. Today, approximately 40% of our business is commercial. We have reached this point today through organic growth, as well as through regional acquisitions, most notably with our AI acquisition, and we are also seeing success early on with BWP. Looking ahead, the pending acquisition of General Parts is another strategic stair step for Advance as we accelerate our growth strategy. Ultimately, these underlying consumer shifts, coupled with industry fundamentals, are the core indicators that point to a stable environment for growth. Specifically, the average age of vehicles has a clip [ph] of 11 years, with approximately 80% of the vehicles over 6 years old. Deferred maintenance has reached record levels. And the increasing complexity of vehicles and parts is prompting customers to entrust complex repairs with independent repair facilities. These customer shifts and fundamentals position Advance to deliver incremental growth while increasing our overall share of the customer's purchases. Despite the near-term sales slowdown, we remain committed to growing our business and profitability through the consistent focus on service leadership and superior availability strategies. We continue to stay the course on our company of one focusing on the fundamentals as our core objective that will guide us for the foreseeable future. For the last number of years, our team was clear that we needed to invest in what the customers wanted most. As a result, we have strong availability, enhanced delivery capabilities, more technology, more talent, and we're in the best position we've ever been in to serve customers. Today, our priorities will continue to include commercial growth, parts availability and improving execution and productivity. George will discuss the work going on in these priorities shortly. Overall, despite challenging sales, I'm encouraged with the progress on the fundamentals and execution as an organization. Great execution is a trademark for all organizations that sustain the balance of structural and motivational initiatives leading to profitable outcomes, sales being just one part of that outcome. Beyond sales, a number of other elements must come together successfully to drive profitable outcomes. And our team has again demonstrated evidence of strong execution through our gross profit rate improvements, in addition to effectively managing costs, which resulted in a 91 basis point improvement in our operating income this quarter. As we head into the fourth quarter, we remain cautious with our sales outlook based on the current market trends. This view of our business for the remainder of the year is reflected in the outlook Mike will discuss a little later. Internally, we continue to remain focused on our strategies and are confident in our team's abilities as we work diligently to drive improved sales outcomes. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for our team members, our customers and our shareholders as I look forward to the combination with General Parts, where our execution of the fundamentals that I spoke of earlier will be the cornerstone for success as we go forward. In closing, I'd like to share an example of how growth and focus on the fundamentals brings service as our best part to life. Regional Vice President, Rich Flaherty, is a leader who has developed a store environment where all team members work together to serve our customers no matter what they need, enables partnerships with our field operations and commercial teams that are solutions-oriented. They truly focus on solving customer service issues to ensure we're always exceeding the customers expectations. Rich and his team have worked tirelessly to build an internal bench of high-performance team members at all levels. Rich communicates very effectively through market meetings with his GMs, PPPs to ensure they're all well aware of the keys to driving the business and have in place ways to remove barriers from serving the customers. Rich, I commend you and your leadership, and thank you for the great work your team is producing. I will now turn the call over to George to update you on the work he is leading on our key priorities that support our 2013 objectives. George E. Sherman Former President Thanks, Darren, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our over 54,000 team members for their commitment to customer service while making progress on our 2013 priorities during the quarter. Additionally, I'd also like to express my excitement over our pending acquisition of General Parts and the tremendous opportunity that we have before us as a result of this transaction. I'll now provide you with an update of the key priorities that support our 2013 objectives of growth and focus on the fundamentals. First, Commercial Business has been and will continue to be a key priority and the primary growth focus of the company. We continue to intensify our focus on executing against the integrated model strategy comprised of DIY and Commercial. Although the commercial market growth rate is outpacing the DIY market, DIY remains an important part of our business, our profitability and our go-forward strategy. And despite the industry-wide slowdown in traffic, through our focus and solid team effort we saw notable growth in the third quarter in our dollars per transaction. In the quarter, our Commercial Business continued to see improved levels of delivery speed and reliability and increased customer retention and share wallet with national and regional customers. Our national and regional accounts growth approached double digits during the third quarter due to our strength and availability and delivery speed, growth in commercial credit card penetration resulting from our in-source credit program and dedicated focus on strengthening relationships with commercial customers. Overall, we are pleased with our commercial program productivity, generating $700,000 per program all-in between Advance, BWP and Autopart International stores. In addition, we are pleased with the leading e-services offerings that we have for our commercial customers. Our B2B e-commerce business grew roughly 50% in the quarter as we continued to advance our capabilities and improve the breadth of services we offer to our customers. We have also rebranded our motor shop suite of services, highlighting Advance's commitment to providing an innovative and holistic customer experience through continued investment and product development, new technologies and customer service. Second, our work continues toward improvement of in-market availability. A key component of this is our hub store strategy. During the quarter, we added 16 hub stores either through new store openings or the upgrade of existing stores strategically located to operate as hubs. At the end of the quarter, our hub store count was 370, an increase of 42 from the third quarter last year. We also continue to work on our daily replenishment capabilities at our Remington DC. As previously stated, we anticipate 400 stores will be serviced by Remington, with approximately 45% of those stores receiving daily replenishment by the end of fiscal 2013. SKU assortments in stores receiving daily replenishment have increased over 1,600 SKUs from the same time period last year as daily replenishment allows us to carry a larger breadth of inventory. Since we deployed our rapid replenishment capability, performance of stores receiving daily delivery have outpaced our control stores within the region, driven by parts categories. We are still in relatively early stages, and we'll continue to monitor results before we can draw any definitive conclusions. And third, we are working tirelessly on improving business performance through effective execution and enhanced productivity, overlaid by an efficient operating model. We're relentlessly committed to simplifying our operations by reducing tasks and improving process in our stores so our team members have more time to focus on engaging with the customer. This focus has started to yield outcomes as we significantly improved our sales per hour performance during the quarter. Broadly speaking, we continue to simplify our field priorities while strengthening our operational DNA [ph] and reorienting our field teams toward profitable sales outcomes versus being a task-based team. When I refer to outcomes, I'm referring holistically to intensifying our customer experience, our customer satisfaction levels and our sales and operating income performance. We are already starting to see positive steps taken in this direction with our expense control and gross margin improvement contributions over the past several quarters. We're also investing in our team members. We remain on course with DIY and continue moving closer and closer toward a more balanced model between DIY and Commercial. This type of evolution requires both an operational and a cultural shift in order to be successful. We are investing in our field leaders and supporting their individual journey within our dual model environment. We are providing our team members with the training and tools to equip them to deliver on those outcomes I referred to earlier. Notably this year, we've implemented new general manager onboarding and district leader training programs. These programs are geared toward developing our leaders consistently on the fundamental principles of effectively coaching and leading our team members, providing the best experience for our customers and effective management of their stores and districts. Turning to new stores. During the quarter, we added 35 new Advance Auto Parts stores, keeping us on track for our new store opening plan this year. The performance of our 2012 and 2013 classes of stores continue to perform at or above our expectations, primarily driven by a faster ramp-up of Commercial Business than previous classes of stores. We are pleased with the performance of our Autopart International business. The solid third quarter performance was led by strong execution, driving double-digit top line sales growth and diligent expense management resulting in strong bottom line performance. We are well into the formal process of integrating our BWP stores and remain on plan to complete the integration of 124 BWP stores into Advance Auto Parts stores by mid-2014, consistent with the time frame previously communicated at the beginning of the fiscal year. The sales and profitability of the BWP stores are currently exceeding our expectations. Most importantly, during the transition, we are remaining focused on employee retention and customer service. As of the third quarter, we successfully converted or consolidated the first 9 stores. And I've learned a lot from the integration process, and now expect to complete approximately 30% of the stores by year-end. Despite fewer conversions and consolidations than originally anticipated this year, we remain on track to complete the process on time. Collectively, our company priorities remain consistently focused on operations that drive results, led by a focus on delivering on our customer promise and enabled through outstanding and consistent execution. Additionally, looking ahead, we could not be more excited about the future growth opportunities for the great work that our teams are already driving forward and with the pending acquisition of General Parts. To be clear, as we prepare to undertake the integration of General Parts post-close, we will be focused to ensure our integration efforts are closely aligned with our operations while continuing to flawlessly execute and deliver the best customer service throughout the process. I've thoroughly enjoyed my first 6 months with Advance. I look forward to continuing to update you on these important priorities in the future as we continue our focus on commercial to build deeper relationships with our core customers and work diligently to drive and improve sales outcome. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Norona, our Chief Financial Officer. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented team members for their continued efforts to improve our business and serve our customers as we navigated through our third quarter. I would also like to say how excited we are about our future partnership with the General Parts team and the transformational opportunities it presents for value creation. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights for our third quarter of 2013; two, put our third quarter results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide some insights on the remainder of 2013 and how we're thinking about 2014. As we shared on our second quarter earnings call, sales began to soften during the last 6 weeks of the quarter. And that softness continued through the third quarter. We believe this continued softness was primarily as a result of the ongoing challenging macroeconomic environment. While we are disappointed with the negative comp store sales, we are pleased with our operating profit performance. Operating profits grew 13.5% versus third quarter last year and were in line with our expectations, driven by both an increase in the gross profit rate and disciplined expense management, resulting in a 91 basis point increase in our operating income rate to 11.2% for the quarter. We remain focused on influencing the things that are in our direct control and positioning our company for longer-term growth and profitability. While we are pleased with our bottom line results during the quarter, we realize in order to continue our profit expansion, we must improve our sales performance while continuing the disciplined spending we've exhibited over the last 3 quarters. As a result of the weaker consumer demand, our comp store sales decreased 2% compared to the third quarter of last year. Our total sales, however, increased 4.3% to $1.5 billion, driven by the impact of the acquisition of BWP and the net addition of 170 new stores over the past 12 months. Our comp store sales decrease was driven by a decline in the number of transactions, partially offset by an increase in the dollars per transaction. The decline in transactions was primarily in DIY, while the dollars per transaction increased in both DIY and Commercial, with a larger increase in Commercial. Year-to-date, our total sales increased 4.3% to $5.1 billion. And our comp store sales declined 2%. Our gross profit rate in the third quarter was 50.2% versus 49.8% in the third quarter of 2012 or an increase of 42 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher merchandise margins, driven by a lower product acquisition cost, partially offset by planned increases in supply chain costs associated with the operation of our Remington DC and the impact of BWP sales, which have a lower gross margin rate due to the higher mix of commercial sales. Through the third quarter, our gross profit rate increased 22 basis points to 50.2% from 49.9% over the same period last year. Our SG&A rate of 39% decreased 49 basis points versus third quarter of 2012, primarily driven by lower marketing expense, improved labor productivity and lower administrative and support costs. These were partially offset by onetime costs related to the pending acquisition of General Parts, higher incentive compensation and the impact of increased new store openings. Through the third quarter, our SG&A rate increased 18 basis points to 39% versus 38.8% over the same period last year. All in, our operating income for the third quarter was $170.7 million, which was an increase of 13.5% versus the third quarter of 2012. This result was in line with our expectations and is a testament to our ability to drive gross profit expansion and the team's disciplined focus on expense management despite softer comp store sales performance. Our operating income rate increased 91 basis points to 11.2% in the third quarter. The increased operating income rate came both from Advance stores, as well as our Autopart International business. Our EPS increased 17.4% versus Q3 last year to $1.42 per share and includes $0.02 of transition costs associated with the integration of BWP and $0.04 related to the pending acquisition of General Parts. We still anticipate the transition of BWP will occur over an 18-month period from acquisition, and the associated costs with 2013 to now be in the range of $0.08 to $0.11. Through the third quarter 2013, our operating income dollars increased 4.7% to $569.5 million. And our diluted EPS increased 7.1% to $4.65, including $0.05 of BWP integration costs and $0.04 of costs related to the pending acquisition of General Parts. Free cash flow through the third quarter was $81.1 million, which is down 72.8% over the same period last year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of BWP. Excluding the net impact of BWP acquisition, our free cash flow would have been $251.5 million compared to $298.6 million over the same time period last year, primarily due to higher owned inventory versus last year, offset by lower capital expenditures. Our owned inventory increased 10.4% from Q3 2012. And our accounts payable to inventory ratio is 83.5% versus 83.2% in third quarter of 2012. Our total inventory increased 12.3%, driven by the acquisition of BWP, more new stores and investments in availability. This increase was higher than our expectations due to our lower-than-anticipated sales performance. We expect our inventory growth will be lower by the end of our fourth quarter and continue to be focused on improving our accounts payable to inventory ratio with a continued goal of getting to 100%. At the end of the third quarter, we had roughly $605 million of debt on our balance sheet. And our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 2.2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. We continue to measure the performance of our business through the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. During the quarter, we continued to accelerate the pace of new store openings, including the net addition of 28 stores. This includes the opening of 35 new Advance stores, offset by the closing of 7 stores, including 5 Autopart International stores and the consolidation of 2 BWP stores into existing Advance stores. At the end of Q3, our total store count was 4,018. Including the acquisition of BWP in Q1, we've increased our net store count by 291 over the last 12 months. We remain on pace to open a total of 170 to 190 new Advance Auto Parts and Autopart International stores this year. In addition to our core store growth, we believe our acquisition of General Parts, which we anticipate closing in late 2013 or early 2014, will accelerate our commercial strategy and position us as a leader in the market, creating a pathway for further growth by opening up new attractive channel opportunities, diversifying and expanding our customer base and enhancing our geographic presence. We expect the acquisition of General Parts to be a significant step to accelerate our commercial growth, which is and will continue to be, the growth strategy for our company. It will also give us an expanded footprint to expand our DIY business. Turning to profit. Advance has been on a mission to improve our profitability through sales growth, gross profit margin expansion and improving our cost structure. Despite softer sales during the quarter, our operating margins increased 91 basis points, driven by gross profit margin improvements, primarily driven by our merchandising teams, resulting in lower acquisition costs and field execution. We also made progress in our expense management, where our field teams improved our labor productivity as measured by our sales per labor hour compared to the third quarter last year. And we continue to lower our administrative and support costs in areas such as professional fees. As a result of a more disciplined approach to expense management, our total SG&A dollars per store decreased to $654,000 per store during the third quarter on a last 12-month basis versus $659,000 during the third quarter of 2012. With respect to value creation, the acquisition of General Parts provides a compelling opportunity to derive shareholder returns through the growth in our business that will drive incremental operating profit, earnings and strong cash flows. Year-to-date, through the third quarter, we have deployed over $317 million of capital, including investing approximately $180 million in our acquisition of BWP and returning approximately $79 million to shareholders via share repurchases. At the end of the quarter, our average diluted share count was 73.1 million shares. Our disciplined approach to capital is reflected in our return on invested capital of 18.6%. For the quarter, our ROIC decreased 38 basis points versus third quarter last year as a result of our increased invested capital due to the acquisition of BWP, the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program and the accelerated pace of our new store openings. Turning to the balance of the year. Given current market conditions, we expect the softness in the sales environment to continue in Q4. As a reminder, Q4 is our lowest volume and most volatile quarter as we compete with holiday shopping season and seasonally lower demand for parts. As a result, we are maintaining a cautious outlook for Q4 sales and now anticipate our annual comparable store sales will be in the low negative single-digits for 2013. We continue to expect that our gross profit rate will increase modestly for the full year. And we will continue to adjust our costs appropriately, given our sales trends to deliver on our profit expectations. We also expect to have headwinds in Q4 with incentive compensation, given our profit growth this year as we anniversary lower incentive compensation in Q4 last year. We expect our SG&A per store to be approximately flat, inclusive of BWP integration costs and all General Parts onetime costs incurred through the third quarter. Given what we see for the fourth quarter, we are maintaining our annual 2013 EPS outlook to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.45, inclusive of BWP integration costs, but excluding all onetime costs incurred in the fourth quarter related to the General Parts acquisition. As we look to 2014, driving top line growth and bottom line profit will continue to be the focus as we begin integrating General Parts. We remain cautious in the short term as our customers continue to adjust to a difficult macroeconomic environment. We expect that longer-term industry dynamics to remain favorable as a result of the continued increase in the average age of vehicles and the deferred maintenance remains at record levels. We expect our top line growth to be driven by stronger commercial comps, improved execution, new stores and continued improvements in our availability. We also expect growth from the additional scale, new channels and capabilities from our pending acquisition of General Parts. We expect to continue to improve our profitability through our existing work to improve our gross profit rate and cost structure and through the realization of the synergies from the pending General Parts acquisition. A key success factor will be to ensure we remain focused on our current day-to-day business operations, delivering on our company objectives and executing against our customer promise, which we are confident we will do. We will provide a more detailed 2014 annual outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. As a reminder, in anticipation of the pending closure of the General Parts transaction, our prepared remarks and any subsequent commentary related to the acquisition will be strictly limited to the transaction materials Advance has already shared. In closing, we are committed to our strategies in Commercial and availability and are focused on improving our sales performance while continuing to improve our profitability and strengthening our returns to continue to drive shareholder value. We also want to thank our 54,000 team members who lead us every day with their relentless focus on service and commitment to operational excellence and execution, which are key ingredients to delivering on our goals. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
162,GV_145977_2007Q4,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Fourth Quarter 2007 Conference Call.

To be notified of the date of future earnings reports you can sign up through the Investor Relations section on our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson our President and CEO who will be followed by Elwyn Murray, EVP Customer Development Officer, Jim Wade, EVP Customer Experience Officer and Mike Norona, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Darren Jackson Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I’m honored to be joining the Advance Auto Parts team today. Ideally we’d be reporting and forecasting stronger results than we did this morning. The top line and the bottom line results for the quarter came in below our expectations. Our sales shortfall in the last six weeks of the quarter was the principle driver of the earnings miss for the quarter. Simply put there was step change decline of five percentage points in our DIY customer traffic during the holiday season. Yes, the economic environment and the customer are very volatile, that isn’t a surprise, and however the severe dip during the holidays was a surprise. It’s a blunt reminder that we must turn around elements of our strategy business model and our focus in order to be successful in increasingly volatile and complex environment. You win in a volatile complex environment by relentlessly focusing on the customer with superior talent and differentiated capabilities including supply chain and IT. Our future at Advance will require a more adaptive customer driven model to succeed in the future. I’m realistic about the road ahead and encouraged about what I’m learning. In my first few weeks here I’ve had an opportunity to meet many of our team members in our stores, distribution centers and our offices. I have been very impressed with their commitment to serving our customers. I thank them for their commitment and look forward to listening to them as we continue to grow our company. My confidence and optimism about our future starts with our AAP team members under the leadership of Jim Wade and Elwyn Murray. In addition, I’m very excited about Kevin Freeland our head of Supply Chain and IT, Mike Norona our CFO and Jud Neistrum our VP Head of Investor Relations and having them join our leadership team. Our focus on superior talent is not just words but has already begun to manifest itself with this team. Jim and Elwyn have been instrumental in leading the strategy development and initiative prioritization process. Kevin brings a world set of leadership and supply chain experience with companies like Dell, Best Buy and PetSmart. Mike Norona bring leadership, finance and strategic implementation capabilities that will allow us to turn abstract things into action and Jud brings strategic and finance decision support skills that will benefit all of us. We are in a turn around mode, I am confident our leadership team and the AAP team members as a whole will embrace this sense of urgency. You might ask, where are we and where are we going? I purposely chose turn around mode to define the state of our business. You must turn around the business and that begins with the focus on the customer. We must embrace a customer focus culture and strategy; we must embrace a turn around mentality in terms of speed, simplicity and prioritization. The prior focus on our 2010 format instead of the customer has us playing catch up on parts availability, parts knowledge and our cost structure. Our biggest opportunity is driving top line sales growth. Our sales per square foot and per employee are in the bottom half of the industry despite all of our capital investments over the last several years. This productivity gap in combination with our cost structure will be a key focus of our team. Our strategy is a simple focus on our people, our customer and our employees. Specifically our strategy will be guided by the DIY and Commercial customer needs. The needs will require us to prioritize availability excellence whether its parts and solutions, having a superior experience whether its employee knowledge in the delivery needs and an efficient enterprise whether it’s the customer cost focus structure in our stores or our overall corporate center. Jack Brouillard, Jim and Elwyn have been reporting on a number of specific initiatives over the last several conference calls. Elwyn and Jim will provide a further update today on our progress. Suffice to say I think we are off to a good start. There is evidence that parts availability is starting to have a positive impact on our Commercial business. The streamlining of our cost structure in the corporate offices, the elimination of the Advance Television and improved trends in self insurance is starting to pay dividends. On the other hand, simplification of our store operating model, the transformation of our supply chain and the organization around the customer are all in the initial stages. These initiatives collectively are all focused again on our largest opportunity which is our top line growth. Turning to our guidance for this year there are many things that I think we’d all agree on for FY08 including the economic back drop, the volatility of the customer and our inability to predict the future with accuracy. The first six weeks of 2008 have modestly perked up; our view of the year is that the customer and the related trends continue to be fragile. We are going to focus on simple ways to build our top and bottom lines. Those things which are in our reach, specifically growing our Commercial business, building the sales productivity of our inventory and sales floor while taking costs out and work out that the customer is not interested in. There will be considerable change that we will be navigating as we focus on turning around the business. This change will add more volatility in 2008 as you would expect. Our best view at this time is that our annual sales will be just over $5 billion driven by 115 new stores with comp store sales that are flat. We would expect the bottom line EPS to be approximately $2.55 per share if our comps are flat with last year. Though our comparable store sales are up 1% year to date. This is our best view today based on the current trends and economic volatility. We believe that we have upward potential if our internal plans take hold. It is early and we will still have favorable interest rate and tax rebate benefits ahead of us which we hope offset higher fuel costs. We would expect EPS to fluctuate $0.10 per share for every one point change in comp store sales. EPS will fluctuate $0.03 for every 10 basis point movement in our operating margin rate. Mike will talk about this more in detail. Here are a few final thoughts. You can count on us to tell you how we see it. We are all disappointed in Q4 and FY07 were below our expectations. The good news is our business has perked up since the steep holiday decline and DIY sales are approaching pre-holiday levels. Our Commercial business is approaching a 10% comp; however these trends still reinforce the need to realign our business model. We are making progress on our initiatives that are focused on the customer. The environment is what it is and we do not like it. We are focused on maximizing what we can improve both in terms of our business model today and in the future. We appreciate your support and your patience. Now I’d like to turn it over to Elwyn. Elwyn Murray Good morning everyone. First of all I would like to begin by expressing on behalf of the management team at Advance our genuine excitement and enthusiasm about the appointment of Darren as our new CEO. In a few short weeks it has become evident to all who have interacted with Darren that he brings a tremendous amount of passion and energy to understanding the customer. He has excellent frameworks and experience to glean customer insight, develop relevant strategies and identify and implement practical and impactable initiatives that we believe will make a difference both in serving DIY and DIFM customer segments in the coming months and years. In my remarks today I will touch on three points: first how we are igniting our top line sales growth by focusing on the customer, provide you with an update on the tangible progress we are making on initiatives focused on the most important customer needs, share with you how we are organizing and building capabilities to support our customer driven model In an effort to ignite top line sales we are repositioning the Advance Auto Parts brand and are launching a new brand campaign in support of this change. In recent months we have worked hard to define what matters most to our customers. This feedback has come from extensive research and our team members. As a result we are redefining how we, as the company, think about ourselves and how we want our customers to think about us. Our focus on the customer manifests itself in our new brand vision which defines our promise to keep the wheels turning. This promise speaks to both our DIY and Commercial customers. For DIY customers our promise means Advance is hear to help them keep their lives on track. For Commercial customer our promise means Advance is a partner that will help them build their sales. Our new Television and Radio commercials connect this promise with the dominant customer needs of parts availability and parts knowledge. Overall we are very excited about new look and feel of this campaign conveys about us. This part centric promise is resonating strongly with our team members and we are confident it will connect with our target traditional DIY customers or commercial customers and with the all important and growing number of Hispanic DIY customers as well. This campaign launch will be supported by heavy electronic media funded from reallocated print spending which we determined to be of minimal value in 2007. Introduced into like markets in February the campaign will roll nationally the first week of March. For those that have not seen or heard the new ads I invite you to visit our website  which we established to augment our internal launch of the campaign. Now I will provide you with an update on the tangible progress we are making on initiatives focused on the most important customer needs. First, we continue to make great strides in improving our parts availability. We are focused on enhancing our late model and foreign vehicle coverage as well as taking aggressive steps in order to get parts closer to our customers. In the fourth quarter alone we introduced over $33 million of incremental hard parts into our supply chain and store network. This compares to $25 million of hard parts introduced in quarters two and three of ’07 combined. We are currently planning to place over $125 million of incremental hard parts inventory into our network in 2008, compared to $63 million total in 2007 and will aggressively work with our supply chain to store network in order to optimize the product location for serving our customers. We are enhancing our custom mix capability which enables us to optimize our market and store specific product assortment decisions. As communicated in previous calls we have and will continue to fund the majority of this increase by making our existing inventory more productive through the removal of slow moving inventory. For the year 2008 we anticipate our net increase in inventory to be in line with our projected sales increase. We are pleased with the incremental sales and productivity of the inventory we added in Q2 and Q3 and look for our Q4 2007 and 2008 incremental investments to produce similar returns on a larger scale. Our parts availability initiative is helping to drive our DIFM business in the near term and ultimately will aid DIY as well. Second, we continue to intensify our commercial focus while we achieve strong 5% to 6% comps in the first half of 2007 we continue to see meaningful opportunity to drive Commercial sales. We accelerated our growth rate to 8% plus in the second half of the year. We saw an improvement in Commercial comps as we went through the fourth quarter and comps continue to run above this rate for the first quarter to date. We continue to look at staffing and training, compensation policies, truck utilization, route optimization and many other areas to best structure us for further Commercial sales and profitability growth. You will continue to hear more about this over the next several quarters. Third, we are changing our previous focus on the front room. As part of our ongoing business review we are improving the productivity and efficiency of our sales floor or front room of our stores. We are continuing the process of rationalizing and removing SKU’s within sales floor categories as well as full categories that do not align with our focus on parts and related items. In the fourth quarter we introduced our first iteration of a 6,000 square foot store that can support our highest level of hard parts inventory. Our previous prototype was 7,000 square feet and as previously merchandised inhibited our parts availability. We will continue to refine this model and it will shape the future design of new store and remodels. In addition to supporting our hard parts coverage we are aggressively looking at incremental auto related category opportunities that will enhance our front room offering for our retail customers as well. Finally, I would like to share with you how we are organizing and building capabilities to support a customer driven model in 2008 and beyond. While we continue to execute upon the many initiatives formed by our strategy review which concluded last May, we are bolstering our internal capability to continuously refine and deepen our customer insight, develop strategies and lead initiative implementation. Specifically my role will be changing to concentrate on what we are calling Customer Acceleration for both DIY and DIFM segments. I will be leading our efforts to organize around DIY and DIFM customer segments respectively and envision staffing to further deepen our customer insights, develop new value propositions, prioritize investment decisions based on customer prospect pools and lead implementation through the organization for these respective businesses. Much like the output of our strategy review conducted in 2007 and formed the strategic direction and initiatives of our functional areas we envision these groups focused on DIY customer segments and DIFM customer segments respectively to provide new insights and strategic direction and to help lead strategy implementation throughout the organization on a continuous basis. We believe these organizational changes will be catalytic in our journey to becoming a customer driven organization. We will provide more color in the coming quarters as these organizational changes progress. I will conclude by saying that I’m very encouraged by the progress we are making and the early results we are seeing from the many initiatives that we have underway. Lastly, I am very excited about our newly intensified focus on the customer and internal capability that we are building in order to create greater value for our customer and competitive advantage for Advance. Now I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Wade I too would like to express my enthusiasm as Darren has begun his role as CEO of our company. Particularly exciting is that Darren’s commitment to learning about the culture that was so critical to our success as [Nick Toman] grew our company to an industry leader. This commitment to serving our customers better than anyone else and building the success of every team member will certainly form a strong base for our future profitability. I’ll spend my time this morning reviewing the steps we are taking within my responsibilities for store operations and store development to maximize our customers experience in our stores as well as key initiatives we are taking to further support our store team and increase our productivity. As we look at our evolving business and our anticipated increased level of Commercial business we are reevaluating everything about how we operate and staff our stores. We know today our sales per square foot and our sales per employee are both lower than most in our industry. At the same time our occupancy costs are higher. As we go forward we must provide high levels of customer service while achieving a higher level of productivity from our labor and asset investments. Our review includes identifying opportunities to simplify our stores by evaluating all of the tasks and processes to ensure they are necessary and add value to the customer experience. As an example, we are upgrading our systems network in our stores which is both enhancing the speed with which our teams can serve our customers while reducing our technology costs. Elwyn also mentioned in his remarks our focus on simplifying the front room and removing unnecessary tasks to increase our productivity. We are reviewing our retail base staffing model to align it better with our rapidly growing Commercial business. We are also reviewing our level of execution of our standard operating procedures. We are not satisfied overall with where we are in executing the basics, tire shrinkage is an example. We are also redefining and measuring the key customer metric that drive our sales and productivity. Our recently implemented enterprise data warehouse is providing us many tools to drive these metrics. In regard to our Commercial business, our strategy review showed that we have a tremendous opportunity to increase our share of this large consistently growing market beyond its current levels. Our research provides us with a solid understanding of the customer driven capabilities we must develop to take full advantage of this opportunity. We know we have some strengths and we also know we have some opportunities. Even with these opportunities we are still growing the business at nearly 10% comps year to date which gives us a very positive view of the long term potential. Over time we believe it will be easier to grow our commercial penetration from 25% of sales to 50% of sales then from 50% to 55%. Elwyn spoke about the importance of increase parts availability especially to the Commercial business. We know we are well on our way to closing this gap. We also know that both our DIY and Commercial customers expect our team to have a large base of parts knowledge so they get the right part every time they call or visit. We are implementing a strategy to raise the level of parts knowledge our customers have available to them. As part of that plan we recently completed a base line assessment of the level of parts knowledge of all of our team members. As we anticipated we found that overall we have a strong team of parts knowledgeable customer advocates. However from this information we know we have opportunities and we now know which parts categories and which markets we need to supplement that knowledge with more training or more resources within the stores. We are now further developing our training tools to close these gaps. A key part of our sales driving efforts in the Commercial area is the maximization of the effectiveness of our Commercial sales force. Our team of over 200 professions has done a great job growing this business in conjunction with our store teams. We are focused now on putting in place the capabilities that will maximize our teams’ talent. We are reviewing the optimal organizational and leadership structure for our Commercial sales force and anticipate having this in place in 2008. We are developing enhanced tools so that our sales force can better target key customers, identify trends and quickly address opportunities. With our relatively young Commercial program we know we have the opportunity to substantially leverage our investment in Commercial parts pros and delivery fleet by increasing sales. We are exploring opportunities to better align the incentive structure to maximize our teams productivity. We recently rolled out our first ever incentive plan for our Commercial Parts pros. This plan has been greeted with enthusiasm and we see the opportunity to expand it further. We are also developing tools to leverage our Commercial delivery fleet across all our stores. We know that long term retention of our store team is critical to achieving our desired customer satisfaction levels. We are pleased to say that in 2007 our overall retention increased over 2006. Now we are taking steps to further increase store team retention. In 2008 for the first time all of our bonus plans include a significant component based on increasing the retention rate of our store managers. Our experience has shown that high store management retention leads to higher retention of the entire store team, our customer service levels and higher profits. We mentioned last quarter that we were doing a complete review of our new store strategy and related occupancy comps. We’ve identified a number of opportunities to more closely align our go forward focus on what matters most in being a parts store while reducing our new store sight and building costs. We’ve incorporated our updated DIY and Commercial sales growth assumptions from our strategy review into our new store research to determine where in markets to best locate stores. We know our DIY customers rate us high on the convenience of our stores and our Commercial customers rate us high on our ability to deliver the part they need quickly. Our updated data is helping us to further refine our store locations to maximize the strength. As we are adjusting our new store strategy we are identifying significant opportunities to reduce our occupancy costs over time by as much as 10% to 20%. We know we don’t need to be located at the main on main sight to achieve our customer’s desire for convenience and speed of delivery. That sight is also typically the most expensive and as we move away from the corner our sight costs are significantly reduced. We made a number of changes to our building specification which will further reduce our costs. Lastly we tested smaller prototype buildings and different store layouts to optimize parts availability and sales floor needs. In mid 2008 we will begin rolling out our 6,000 square foot prototype as we open new stores in many of our markets. As we said on our last call we reduced our new store openings from 196 stores in 2007 to 115 stores in 2008. We made this decision primarily to provide us the time to incorporate our strategy changes into our new store model. We believe the current challenges in the economic environment even further support this decision. We will consider potential ramp up of openings in 2009. Now let me turn the call over to Mike to review our financial results. Mike Norona I’m happy to be joining the Advance Auto Parts team and starting my first few days of work with you. I plan to briefly cover the following four topics: an overview of our Q4 results, insights regarding key trends in our business, connecting our strategic priorities with our financial measures, providing the context and assumptions to our annual FY08 forecast. In the fourth quarter our sales were $1 million driven by 196 new store and partially offset by our comp store sales which declined by 0.4% compared to an increase of 1.6% last year. We had forecast our fourth quarter sales to be flat to 2% positive for the quarter. Overall we missed for the reasons Darren outlined. However our Commercial sales grew consistently in the 8% to 9% range through the entire quarter as we had expected. The disappointment in the fourth quarter was our DIY comps were negative 3.1% compared to negative 0.3% last year. There was a step change in December in our DIY sales. From the beginning of the quarter until Thanksgiving our DIY comp was down 1%, the day after Thanksgiving until the end of the quarter our DIY comp was a negative 6%. We believe our DIY business was negatively impacted during the holiday season as consumers shifted their limited purchasing dollars to other priorities during this time. The DIY business is currently running down 2% versus the 6% decline we saw over the holidays. The bottom line is DIY comps are still not where we want them to be. We believe that the tough economic environment continues to hamper DIY sales and we believe we have opportunities to turn this business around as Elwyn and Jim discussed. Our Commercial comps were 8.2% in the fourth quarter over 7.9% last year. Our focus remains on getting our commercial comps to consistently sustain a double digit run rate. Year to date we are just shy of 10%. Commercial sales including auto part international represented 27% of our total sales. For the quarter our total Commercial sales including AI were $288.1 million, a 13% increase over last year. Today about 83% of our Advance store have Commercial programs compared to 81% for the fourth quarter last year. It’s a good start but miles to go. On a geographic basis our comps continue to be stronger in the North and Midwest and weaker in our other markets. The trends in Florida and the Gulf Coast in the fourth quarter continue to lag the company, weighing down the comps by a half percentage point. Our gross profit margin was 47.1% in the fourth quarter which was flat compared to the prior year. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter and reflected a significant improvement from the third quarter. Overall, the mix of business or product sales helped offset strategic price changes to become more competitive in the parts business. Our poor shrink and defective inventory cost 40 basis points in the quarter. Jim spoke of our efforts to fix these types of issues in his remarks. SG&A de-leveraged by 24 basis points in the quarter. I’m not surprised because it’s hard to leverage expense with negative comp store sales growth. Actually we had forecast that we would leverage with our 0% to 2% comp guidance and the de-leverage resulted form the lower than anticipated DIY sales that came in the second half of the quarter. There are some key insights from my view. The company took out over 100 basis points in non-productive media, corporate overhead, self insurance, store development and logistics but gave it back in fixed occupancy costs, store selling payroll and the absence of insurance recovery process which were included in last years results. I hope this transparency helps. In addition, it also highlights our sales productivity issues. Interest expense was $8.2 million in the quarter or slightly higher compared to $7.8 million last year. Our boring costs in the fourth quarter averaged approximately 6%. In the fourth quarter we repurchased two million shares or approximately 2% of our total outstanding at an average price of $37.10 for a total expenditure of $75 million. Since the end of 2007 we have repurchased another four point six million shares at an average price of $34.04 for a total expenditure of $155 million. We now have $105 million left on our share repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As a result of our share purchases our fully diluted fourth quarter share count was 100.7 million shares a reduction of two point five million shares in the third quarter. For 2008 we are using a share count of 96 million in our guidance assumptions. Our fourth quarter income tax rate was 37% that’s compared to 38% last year primarily due to one time tax credits. We anticipate the tax rate in 2008 to be approximately 38%. Earnings per share were $0.35 for the quarter compare to $0.33 for the fourth quarter last year which was slightly below our guidance range of $0.36 to $0.40 as a result of the things we have discussed today. Let me highlight a few items in our balance sheet and our cash flows. For the quarter inventory increased 4.5% on a sales increase of 3.2%. This increase in inventory was due to our parts availability initiative somewhat offset by our focus plan to improve inventory productivity. Specifically we are funding the majority of our parts availability initiative through several inventory reduction initiatives. There is more to come as Kevin Freeland and his team focus on our supply chain and inventory management optimization. Our capital expenditures were $73 million for the quarter and $220 million for the year. This compares to $259 million in 2006 a reduction of $39 million. We estimate capital expenditures for 2008 to be $170 to $190 million, the largest portion of our 2008 capex budget will be approximately $55 million for store development, $60 million in maintenance capital for our stores, distribution centers and corporate infrastructure primarily IT related and $50 million for a new IT and logistics investment initiatives. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio was 55.1% compared to 53.2% last year. We continue to see opportunity to grow our AP ratio over time. We anticipate our ratio in 2008 will be in line with or slightly higher than 2007. The big win for 2007 was $151 million improvement in free cash flow. The increase to $234 million resulted from lower capital spending and working capital improvements. All in all, 280% improvement. We anticipate free cash flow in 2008 to be in the range of $175 to $195 million. Beginning this quarter we have decided to change our policy in regard to how we provide earnings guidance. We will continue to provide annual guidance as we have in the past but we will discontinue providing guidance by quarter. We believe this policy will still provide you the information you need to evaluate our progress while properly aligning our internal focus. You will also note we increased our transparency this morning and added some additional metrics to our release. In terms of guidance for 2008 we continue to see a challenging sales environment where we believe it is prudent for us to forecast comps to be flat until our trends and the economic environment show sustained improvement. We are cautiously optimistic that lower interest rates and tax rebates will provide a positive up. Yet the escalating price per gallon of gas forecast for 2008 tempers our optimism. We anticipate gross margin to improve modestly as we continue to pursue lower costs and leverage and logistics work. With our SG&A reductions we believe we can leverage SG&A in 2008 at the 1% comp levels. With these assumptions we anticipate diluted earnings per share of $2.55 in 2008 as compared to $2.28 in 2007, for an increase of 12%. We are focused on achieving higher levels of comp sales and bottom line improvement with our strategic initiatives. Our guidance is based on the prevailing environment. We anticipate that a 1% improvement in our comps versus guidance will at $0.10 to our FY08 bottom line. Similarly an operating margin rate improvement of 10 basis points would add $0.03 earnings per diluted share. As we mentioned on the last call 2008 includes 53 weeks and our guidance is for that time. We anticipate the 53rd week will have an approximate $0.10 positive impact on our 2008 earnings per share results. The best use of our time is to focus on our strategic priorities to deliver the results that will satisfy all of us. Darren Jackson We are now ready for questions."

Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson our CEO, who will be followed by Jim Wade our President; Kevin Freeland, Chief Operating Officer and Mike Norona, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Darren. Darren R. Jackson Thanks Judd. Good morning everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2008 conference call. It’s an honor to share with you the terrific results that our 48,000 team members delivered in these extraordinarily challenging times. I want to thank our Advance family personally for an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. The first year or the first chapter of our transformation story is complete. There was considerable suspense and success as the chapter or year unfolded. I’m very pleased with our strategic and financial progress and the related accomplishments in fiscal 2008. I am energized with the revitalization of the values at Advance and our continued focus and commitment to our customers and team members. I am also very encouraged about our growth and earnings potential, yet I realize that our transformation is just starting to take hold, and it will take time to reach our full potential. Yet I am confident that we will get there. A year ago we embarked on a turnaround and transformation journey. We set out to define the state of the business and acknowledged that the turnaround of our business had to begin with a focus on the customer. I told you that we are going to embrace the turnaround mentality in terms of speed, simplicity and prioritization. We determined our strategy would be a simple focus on people; our customers and our team members. Specifically, our strategy would be guided by the DIY in commercial customer needs. Two-thousand-eight was the year focused on foundational change. We evaluated our portfolio of inventory, stores and initiatives. We retired our 2010 store format strategy. We introduced the commercial acceleration, DIY turnaround, availability excellence and superior experience strategies as the catalyst for our transformation. We are divesting of inventory and accessing stores that are not consistent with our future direction. The economic environment is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, we are deeply concerned for many of our fellow Americans, customers and family members on account of the crisis of unemployment. However, our industry and our role as a company have never been more important to meet the needs of our customers. We believe that the paradox of the economic environment is an opportunity for Advance. The rapid decline in consumer confidence, rapidly rising unemployment, the credit crisis, coupled with the single largest decline in annual miles driven of 3.7% presented significant headwinds throughout 2008. Now the tailwinds coming into 2009 include fewer new car sales and lower gas prices. Fewer new car sales result in customers keeping their vehicles longer, which increases the age of vehicles and the need to repair and maintain vehicles, while lower gas prices in late 2008 should begin to take some pressure off customers and enable them to spend some money on deferred maintenance. We believe that future stimulus will add to the tailwinds in 2009. The paradox of the retail environment played out in the fourth quarter of 2008. Specifically, retail industry comp for sales declined approximately 5% in December, representing the worst retail environment in 40 years. Despite the environment, our comparable store sales grew 3% which is our highest quarterly comp in 11 quarters and our EPS jumped 17% on a comparable operating basis. I am very encouraged that all three areas of our company posted positive comparable store sales gains in the quarter. That consistency of performance reflects the collective efforts of the field and support center executing at a high level for our customers. Clearly the actions we took in Q4 continued to improve our business model and yielded immediate benefits in the quarter which positioned us well for 2009 and beyond. Financially we are optimistic about our growth potential. Overall in 2008 we completed a successful Chapter 1 of our transformation story by accelerating top-line growth and achieving solid bottom line results. Two-thousand-nine is a new chapter in the same story. We are committed and focused on our four strategies to turnaround and transform our business. My goal as CEO is to accelerate our success in 2009 and beyond by building and empowering a great team. To do that, I must lead change and support the business and the team. To this end, we recently announced the promotions of Jim Wade to President and Kevin Freeland to Chief Operating Officer. These leadership changes will allow us to streamline our company’s structure; simplify and empower decision making closer to where the work is happening; increase focus on our four key strategies; and increase the speed of getting strategic initiatives to market. We also transitioned our store managers to the role of general managers; the changes being made to reflect the positions responsibilities, which are broader than simply managing a store. The general manager is responsible for supporting and growing both DIY and commercial sales in our integrated operating model. I have tremendous confidence in our leadership team and our general managers. Jim, Kevin and Mike will cover the strategic and financial results in more detail. In addition, Mike will cover our annual financial outlook for the upcoming year. We continue to take action to position the business for success in 2009 and beyond. The team’s ability to live our values and serve our customers better than anyone else will make the difference. I will close with an example of a team member who is a living example of what [good] looks like for growing our business. Dave Bearden was recently named District Manager of the Year for his region. Dave embraces the Advance values and strategic initiatives, and as a result has produced outstanding results. He demonstrates performance excellence in a consistent, meaningful and timely manner. Dave is a leader who inspires and motivates his team to reach out and achieve their full potential. He realizes the success of each store, his division and the company depends on his leadership in translating the company’s initiatives into operational excellence. He is a company leader with his customer satisfaction and team member engagement results, and today I am proud to have Dave leading one of our districts. Congratulations on a job well done, Dave. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Jim to provide a progress update on our commercial acceleration and DIY transformation strategy. Jimmie L. Wade Thank you Darren and good morning. Let me start by saying I’m excited about the opportunity to lead our customer and sales driving functions, which include our DIY and commercial sales; marketing; customer insight and advertising; field and store operations; Autopart International and real estate. Now I’ll update you on our progress with our commercial acceleration and DIY transformation strategy. We’re pleased with the overall progress we made with our commercial acceleration strategy in the fourth quarter and for the year. We ended 2008 with our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit comp growth with a 13.7% commercial comp for the fourth quarter, and 12.1% for the year. And we made good progress continuing to improve all of our team sales productivity methods. We also continued to gain market share in a business that is very fragmented and is still growing overall. I want to thank our store teams, our sales force and our support functions for the great job they did serving our customers and growing our commercial business in 2008. With our less than 3% commercial market share, we believe there is still much room for growth. We remain committed to aggressively growing the commercial business and despite the broader economic challenges, we believe we can continue to achieve double-digit comps in 2009. As we look into 2009 our primary focus will be to further accelerate our commercial business in the following three areas. We’ve developed a database to provide the full potential commercial sales for each store that is enabling us to aggressively invest in parts [credited] trucks and drivers in our stores and markets with the greatest potential, and with a proven track record of strong performance. We’ll continue to focus on building the basics of great customer service at each store. That means leveraging the increased parts availability in addition of key brands that Kevin and his team are driving. It also means focusing on timely, accurate and consistent deliveries to our garage customers; and knowledgeable team members who understand our commercial business. Not only will invest significantly in our commercial sales force; we’ll increase the number of commercial account managers as well as provide them more tools that will help us acquire new customers and increase our share of existing customers purchases. To give an example of what great customer service looks like, I’d like to share a story with you about one store’s success working with teams to serve their commercial customers. In our recent commercial customers satisfaction survey, we had a few stores that actually received 100% customer satisfaction scores. General manager Lynn Dudley, who’s been with Advance for nine years, leads one of those stores and has clearly taken full ownership of the commercial business. Our commercial account manager for that market, James [McNeed], works directly with the store team to build great relationships that cause customers to call the store for the parts they need. Commercial parts [inaudible] Robert [Burden] takes those calls and provides exceptional service every day. His previous background as a shop owner helps him better understand the needs of his customers. This store also has a great team of drivers who quickly get the right parts to the customers while expressing our appreciation for their business. The bottom line is that the entire team has earned the respect of their commercial customers. As a result, the customers reward them with their loyalty and that produces these excellent customer satisfaction scores. Thanks, team, for this outstanding example of teamwork and commercial acceleration. I’d also like to recognize the Autopart International team for another solid performance this quarter with a 6.4% comp sales increase for the quarter. AI continues to see strong success with its business model and we’re continuing to apply the AI teams knowledge to help us grow our overall commercial business. Turning now to our DIY transformation strategies, we made progress in the fourth quarter and in 2008 but we still have a lot of work to do. Our DIY comps were a negative 1.1% compared to a negative 3.1% in the fourth quarter last year. On a positive note, the DIY sales trend was a 300 basis point improvement from the third quarter 2008. Overall, nearly 50% of our stores did have positive DIY comps in the quarter and we believe our overall market share remains roughly the same. Although DIY sales trends improved for the quarter, we still were not consistent enough with our initiatives and executions to turn our comps positive in total. We are pleased to announce that Greg Johnson is joining our team as Senior Vice President DIY and Chief Marketing Officer. Greg has extensive background driving sales and focusing on customers and their needs with companies including Gillette, Best Buy and Eastman Kodak. We look forward to the contribution Greg will make to growing our DIY business, as well as being responsible for our overall marketing strategy and initiatives. In the first quarter we’ll continue to build on the tools to improve our execution on the DIY initiatives that we’ve described to you in previous calls including attachment rates, bilingual staff, staffing and weekend scheduling. We’ll also work harder to take advantage of the additional parts availability investment that we continue to make. We believe our 2009 advertising plan will drive more DIY traffic to our stores as it focuses more on promotional radio and less on branding primarily by TV. Lastly, we’re also looking forward to achieving more consistent customer service across our chain by learning from those stores that are getting great DIY results and from the new team member systems that we’ve launched. In addition to these specific initiatives, our entire team will make a stronger commitment that we can achieve positive DIY comps by focusing on serving each customer better. Our customer satisfaction scores by store are helping us gauge our progress. Pushing to new store development, we opened 26 stores during the fourth quarter. We also closed ten stores and relocated two. During 2008 we opened 127 stores including 18 by Autopart International. We closed 20 stores and relocated ten. Our total store count at the end of the year was 3,368. We previously said that we’re reviewing our store performance and our overall real estate portfolio. Mike will share more information on our store closing plans as well as our plans for continuing new store growth in 2009. In closing, we’re pleased with our commercial results and somewhat encouraged by the improvement in our DIY results during the fourth quarter. That said, we’re disappointed that our DIY comps remain negative and the bottom line is we have more work to do. Yet from the inside we see potential from things that are within our control. We’re encouraged by the progress a number of our markets are making and we thank them for showing us what good looks like. We’ll continue to share our progress in DIY as we further develop our go forward plans under Greg’s leadership. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Kevin to review our availability excellence and superior experience strategies. Kevin Freeland Thanks Jim and good morning. I would also like to express my excitement about the opportunity to lead the company’s day-to-day operational functions including merchandising; inventory management; supply chain; store operations support; e-commerce; and information technology. I’d like to update you on the execution of our availability excellence and superior experience strategies. Availability excellence enables us to serve our customers better than anyone else by redefining the standards of breadth, depth and speed of delivery of parts. I want to congratulate the team for significantly increasing our parts availability in 2008. I would like to provide visibility to the key areas that will drive long term value. We will continue to invest in merchandising capabilities, invest in parts and reduce our net owned inventory. The transition toward our integrated operating model in merchandising is complete and our eight category teams are in place and engaged under this new model. We will continue to roll out our new category management process and are on track to improve the category’s performance in 2009. We recently launched the company’s global sourcing capability and private brand strategy. We have begun staffing teams in the states as well as overseas. In 2009 we plan to begin directly sourcing specific products to create competitive positions on the opening price point portion of our DIY assortment. We will also continue the rollout of our price optimization process which favorably impacted our Q4 growth margins. In 2008, we continued to upgrade inventory selections. For the year, we added over $100 million in hard parts including the addition of Lewis and Wagner and inventory upgrades in approximately 1,000 stores. We completed a new custom mix process that will produce higher sales and gross margins with no incremental inventory investment. Our custom mix system began it’s national rollout in the fourth quarter and we anticipate the full rollout will occur over the next 18 months. In Q4 we completed our review of inventory productivity. As part of that review, we decided to significantly change how we managed the end of life cycle of our inventory. In the past, we devoted our return privileges to parts for early model cars with greater than five years supply. In an effort to significantly improve inventory productivity, we have discontinued replenishment on all early model parts with two to four years of supply and have tightened our policy of obsolescence to greater than four years of supply. This policy change has led to a one-time, non-cash inventory adjustment of $37.5 million. More importantly, we will free up shelf space in our stores to insure the right parts are in stock. Mike Norona will share details about this in a few minutes. Moving on to supply chain, we continue to identify opportunities to drive efficiencies. We successfully piloted engineered standards in one of our distribution centers in Q4 and are migrating engineered standards to the balance of our distribution centers this year. This initiative enabled us to improve labor productivity in our main distribution centers and reduce distribution expenses over time. We recently announced the outsourcing of our private fleet to UPS Freight and Schneider. This change will allow us to focus more attention and resources on achieving advances for key strategies and meeting retail and commercial customers needs; a better ability to manage transportation as the company continues to grow; provide access to more resources and improve technology through national carriers; allow more scheduling flexibility, all of which will reduce our overall costs. These cost savings will fund our national expansion of our parts delivered quickly or PDQ network. We recently added a PDQ in Chicago and will add an additional PDQ each quarter for the foreseeable future. PDQ’s allow us to restock our stores with critical parts within two hours versus 24 hours in the past. Turning to information technology, we are continuing to leverage IT in support of our business strategies. As previously announced, we began a multi-year effort to replace our legacy merchandising systems with Oracle merchandising system. Work on this critical system will be brought online in stages beginning in the third quarter of this year. In addition, we’re developing our own independent e-commerce site. Our superior experience strategy enables us to serve our customers better than anyone else by consistently providing legendary customer service through a relentless focus on execution. Superior experience translates that goal into the specific activities that our team members must perform in order to unlock their full potential, drive significant customer satisfaction improvements, while ultimately accelerating sales growth. I would like to provide an overview of the accomplishments in Q4 as well as our objectives for Q1, 2009. In 2004 we better aligned our labor hours with customer needs. As sales accelerated above our initial expectations, we allocated additional hours where needed to fuel sales. For the entire quarter, we leveraged DIY labor compared to Q4 2007 while supporting the needs of our rapidly growing commercial business. In addition, we streamlined and eliminated several operational tasks to increase the portion of our labor hours devoted to customer service. To plan for the continued acceleration of our commercial business we tested a new integrated operating model in one market. The results of this test include a doubling of our on time commercial deliveries, significant leveraging of our driver hour expense, and acceleration of our commercial sales. This new stamping model will begin a phased rollout in Q1. In 2008 we made material improvements in strength; workers compensation; and general manager turnover. And finally, I’m encouraged about our future, particularly after recently spending time with our general managers and field leadership at our annual team meeting. Now let me turn the call over to Mike to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. I’d like to start by personally thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for the results we achieved this quarter. We’re in one of the most challenging and unprecedented economic environments ever, yet our team members found a way to take care of customers, accelerate our turnarounds, and deliver a strong financial quarter. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning; one, provide some financial highlights for 2008 fourth quarter and annual results; two, put our 2008 annual results into perspective with our turnarounds, including sharing actions we took and are taking to position us for success in 2009 and beyond; and three, provide our annual financial outlook for 2009. Turning to our fourth quarter, our results include the impact of both the 53rd week and non-cash inventory adjustment resulting from a change in inventory management and related accounting policy change. I plan to share some insights on both of these items and then speak about our results on both a 12 week and 52 week comparable basis, as that provides a more transparent and relevant comparison to 2007. We have also included this in our press release. Our operating performance during the fourth quarter including the 53rd week but excluding the non-cash inventory adjustments was $0.51 diluted EPS versus the first call consensus estimates of $0.37 and $0.35 for last year. The 53rd week added approximately $0.10 to our fourth quarter results and came in higher than the $0.07 we had estimated. The favorability was driven by better than expected sales and a higher gross profit rate. As Kevin shared, we also made a non-cash inventory adjustment of $37.5 million which reduced EPS by $0.25 in the quarter. This adjustment resulted from a change in inventory management and related accounting policies. Removing this non-productive inventory from our portfolio, combined with our custom mix initiative, will allow us to improve the quality and productivity our brand [inaudible]. On a comparable 12 week basis, our EPS increased 17% or $0.41 in the fourth quarter compared to last year, driven by increased operating income, reduced interest expense and a lower share count. Some highlights for the quarter include a 3% comp sales increase, comprised of a 13.7% increase in commercial offset by a 1.1% decline in DIY; and 140 basis point increase in gross profit rates due to improved shrink, more effective pricing and a higher mix of sales from Autopart International. Also in the quarter, our SG&A increased 125 basis points driven by increased incentive compensation, strategic capability investments, and legal settlement costs. On a comparable 52 week basis, excluding the non-cash inventory adjustment, our EPS increased 16% to $2.65 compared to last year. Some highlights for the year include opening a net 107 new stores; a 1.5% comp sales increase comprised of a 12.1% increase in commercial offset by a 2.3% decline in DIY; and a seven basis point increase in gross profit rates due to improved shrink, more effective pricing, and a higher mix of sales from Autopart International. Additionally, our SG&A increased 66 basis points driven by strategic capability investments; increased incentive compensation; partially offset by lower medical expenses. Additionally free cash flow for the year increased 19% to $280 million over last year, primarily driven by the impact of the 53rd week and reduced capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $185 million for the year compared to $210.6 million last year. The decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to a reduction in new store development. To put our 2008 fourth quarter and annual financial results in perspective, we are pleased with our double-digit commercial comp sales growth; gross profit rate improvement; and earnings growth we delivered. We are also pleased with our free cash flow improvement and liquidity given the challenging and unprecedented economic environment. We are also realistic that we are early in our turnaround and need to balance short term earnings growth with making the required investments that will deliver long term value. Nowhere was this more evident than in 2008 and in our SG&A per store which increased to $609 thousand per store 2008 from $601 thousand in 2007. Clearly this is a reminder of the structural and operational investments we made and must continue to make to transform and differentiate our business to deliver sustainable and consistent growth. Now I would like to link our 2008 results with our turnaround. Two-thousand-and-eight was the first part of the journey which involves performing in-depth assessments of all parts of our business to unlock our full potential. This included determining our strategic direction; identifying fundamental capabilities for key strategies; making some required investments; and putting the foundational elements in place to get the work done. We also identified underperforming parts of our business that we need to [pay] back because they no longer fit with our strategic direction or deliver acceptable returns. We also identified four performance gauges that will be our financial compass for our turnaround. Our current performance in these gauges shows we are trailing the class of our competitors, with the key insight being we have a 13% sales productivity gap to the leader. That is, our sales per square foot, $208 is 13% below the industry leader despite the fact we spend roughly the same amount of SG&A per square foot. One of the key outcomes of our turnaround is to close this productivity gap. Two-thousand-and-nine will be about reconfiguring our business model around our customer; reducing expenses to partially fund continued strategic investments; and improving executions through peer group performance management. We will continue to focus on our four strategies and build on the assessments and investments we started in 2008. Our largest investments will be aimed at accelerating our commercial business and revitalizing our DIY business as Jim outlined. As Kevin shared, this also includes key investments in the enabling parts of our business such as availability excellence and superior experience to improve our operations. One of the keys to operations is consistent execution. Today we have a high degree of variability in our store performance. By way of example, we shared that our sales per square foot currently lags our competitors. Averages can sometimes be misleading because what you cannot see is that our top 10% of stores are delivering over $350 per foot while our bottom 10% are delivering $100 per square foot. Therefore the opportunity lies in narrowing the performance gap by improving our bottom poor performers. To accomplish this, we’re in the early stages of segmenting our stores into peer groups which have similar operating characteristics to drive performance. This approach will allow us to focus on our performance gaps within each peer group. Turning to fiscal 2009, and consistent with last year, we are providing annual financial assumptions to help you determine your 2009 estimates with different performance sensitivities. We believe this approach continues to be prudent given where we are in our turnaround and the prevailing uncertainty in the economic environment. Additionally, our roller coaster ride in 2008 proved that we are better operators than we are predictors of the future. In 2009 we expect a double-digit increase in commercial comp sales partially offset by low, single-digit negative DIY comp sales. We also anticipate a modest increase in our gross profit rate. Given 2009 will again be a year where we balance growth and investments, our SG&A rate is expected to increase and leverage at approximately a 3% increase in comp sales. While our destination is clearly focused on delivering long-term value to the shareholders, in the short term our SG&A will be constrained by continued strategic investments. One of the ways that we are mitigating this impact is to fund these investments by reducing existing expenses from less productive areas. Our 2009 store divestitures are an example of this. From our 2008, fiscal year 52-week EPS results of $2.55 we expect that each 1% increase in comparable store sales adds approximately $0.07 in EPS. In addition, a 10 basis point improvement in operating margins is expected to add approximately $0.03 of EPS. As a reminder, fiscal year 2009 includes 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2008. The additional fiscal week of business in 2008 contributed $88.8 million in revenue, $15.8 million in operating income and $0.10 of EPS. In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect EPS growth to be limited in the first half of 2009 driven by increased [achieved] capability in investments and more difficult comparisons to the first half of last year due to items such as savings, annualizations, and the economic stimulus check. Conversely, we expect EPS growth to be more robust in the second half of 2009 as we begin to realize the returns on the investments in 2008 and early 2009. In 2009 we are planning an incremental 40 to 55 Advance store divestitures on top of the annual 15 store closures we typically do. These divestitures were identified based on a thorough review of our real estate, store portfolio and are consistent with our approach to take action on all under-performing parts of our business that are not delivering acceptable returns or they’re not fit strategically. One of the key drivers of these underperforming stores is they’re un-competitive occupancy costs. We provide a range of store divestitures because they are a moving target based on rent renegotiations. We are committed to working with our landlord partners to lower occupancy costs to current market rates. In cases where we are unsuccessful we are prepared to make the tough choices. Going forward we will be performing a rigorous examination of our occupancy costs compared to market rates. Our 2009 annual financial outlook does not include these incremental 40 to 55 divestitures. Our best cost estimate for the store divestitures is approximately $500 thousand per store, primarily driven by the long remaining lease terms adjusted anticipated subleased income as well as the write-off of store assets. The payback on these incremental store divestitures is less than three years, driven by the elimination of current operating losses and inventory transfers to existing stores, along with the related tax benefits. Conversely, we see considerable opportunities to grow our store portfolio. In 2009 we expect to open approximately 105 new stores with 75 being Advance stores and 30 being Autopart International stores. This mix is reflective of the growth we see in our commercial business. As also can be seen, the number of total Advance stores will remain roughly flat in 2009, with the openings being mostly offset by the store divestitures. In closing, we are pleased with our fourth quarter results and happy with our strong start to 2009. We are committed to our four strategies including taking the appropriate actions and making the necessary investments required to reach our full potential. We are also balancing our optimism with the unprecedented economic conditions and we remain vigilant to have our four gauges measure our progress. Most importantly, we are investing in and betting on our talented team members to lead us to our turnaround. I am particularly proud how our team members responded from our third quarter performance to deliver the top and bottom line outcomes they did in our fourth quarter. Not only did this provide momentum as we enter 2009, but it helps to drive our free cash flow which in this challenging environment provides a solid foundation to build from. We are now ready for questions. Operator."
164,GV_145977_2009Q4,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Fourth Quarter 2009 Conference Call. Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Director, Finance and Performance Management and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call. Joshua Moore Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause the results to differ materially. The most important of these risks, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures, are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings. These can be found on our website at advanceautoparts.com. The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call, and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. I'd like to remind you that our fiscal 2009 results include the impact of store divestitures, and our fiscal 2008 fourth quarter and full year results include the impact of both a 53rd week and a non-cash inventory adjustment resulting from a change in inventory management approach. Results on this call will be on a 12-week and 52-week comparable operating basis, as that provides a more transparent and relevant year- over-year comparison. We have provided both GAAP and comparable financial results in our press release. For planning purposes, our first quarter earnings release is scheduled for Wednesday, May 19, 2010 after market close, and our quarterly conference is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, May 20, 2010. To be notified of the dates of future earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our CEO. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. First, I'd like to begin by thanking our 49,000 Team Members for their hard work during the fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 year. Their contributions have produced many accomplishments this year, both financially and strategically. Since we began our journey to turn around and transform our company, there have been several quarters in which the financial results significantly outpaced our strategic results. However, during the fourth quarter, our strategic results outpaced our financial results. Overall we had many strategic successes in the quarter, but quite frankly, our fourth quarter performance did not meet our financial expectations. As an organization, we don't measure success by the results of one quarter. However, our organization will never be satisfied with underperformance. We believe that the fourth quarter performance is more of a short-term setback than a long-term trend. That said, both our strategic and financial results for fiscal 2009 were very encouraging. Results can mean different things to different people. Our results include improvements in customer satisfaction, team member engagement, increased average store sales growth and double-digit gains in both our operating income and economic profit. These results translated into a return on invested capital of 15.1%, which is up 110 basis points over last year. Collectively, our balance between long-term and short-term improvements reinforce our positive outlook for 2010 and beyond. Fiscal 2009 ended the turnaround phase of our Advance Auto Parts strategic plan. Over the past two years, our focus has been on setting clear strategic direction for Advance through our four-key strategy, closing material capability gaps and accelerating our top line growth. Simply put, we focused on reigniting our core values of our team: Inspire, serve and grow to deliver legendary customer service. To this end, we began rebalancing our business to pave the way for an integrated 50/50 DIY Commercial model. We overhauled our merchandise and supply chain capabilities to grow both our top line and our margin rate. We developed our first truly integrated E-commerce website to provide a multichannel experience for customers and we strengthened our Hard Parts business which has been neglected over the years. Finally, we accelerated our commercial growth, which resulted in eight consecutive quarters of double- digit commercial comp sales growth for Advance stores. The breadth of pace of this change can be both aggressive and challenging at times, yet it has been necessary. Fiscal 2010 opened the new year and the next phase of our strategic plan. We continue to see positive trends for our industry with the strengthening of our garage customers as the result of dealer closings. Increases in average vehicle age and increases in miles driven, combined with these positive signs in our industry and the breadth of our change over the past two years, our focus will now move from depth of change, focusing on fewer priorities that will deliver bigger impact. That focus will be squarely on our customer-facing capabilities, primarily retail, commercial and store operations. The specific areas we will focus on are leadership effectiveness, customer engagement and operations excellence. We will ensure our field leaders and our stores are prepared to manage an integrated service model providing legendary customer service in both our DIY and our Commercial customers, and ensure our Team Members have the tools in the form of systems, standardized processes and training to deliver service consistently each time and every time. Jim, Kevin and Mike will outline some of these priorities later in the call. In early January, we held our annual leadership conference with all of our general managers, district managers and other key leadership. Nearly 4,000 AAP front line leaders, our ability to harness 49,000 Team Members to understand, embrace, execute our strategies and priorities will drive our success in the long-term. I am confident we are moving in the right direction. That confidence comes as a result of the feedback from our leadership conference where 95 plus percent responded they are both clear about what is expected of them and are excited about the future of our company. We have a focused agenda to accelerate growth, and I am encouraged with our start in 2010. During the conference, we recognized store general managers and their field teams for their accomplishments over the past year. As part of that recognition, we also acknowledged one regional Vice President in each of our three areas as our RVP of the Year. Our three award winners for 2009 were Joe González, Frank Miller and Mike Cox. These leaders and their teams are great examples of leaders who teach our values by serving our customers better than anyone. Congratulations to all of our award winners, including Joe, Frank and Mike, for their contributions. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to provide progress update our Commercial Acceleration and DIY Transformation strategies. Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank our team for a successful year in 2009. I'll start my comments by reviewing our total sales growth and then talking about our progress with our Commercial Acceleration and DIY Transformation strategies. Our total comp sales growth for the fourth quarter was 2.4% compared to 3% during the same quarter last year. We are not satisfied with our overall fourth quarter sales results. However, we did again achieved an increase in both customer transactions and average transaction size, and our sales growth rate was close to two times the market growth during the quarter, which has positioned us well for a successful 2010. Looking at our Commercial performance, our total comp sales increase was 9.5%. And for our Advance stores, our comp increase was 10.2%, which represented our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. When adjusted for the calendar change from last year, our total Commercial comp sales increased 11.3%. This increase was on top of the 13.7% comp sales increase, including AI, and a 14.5% comp increase for our Advance stores during the fourth quarter last year. As a result of our comp sales growth, our Commercial sales mix, as a percent total sales, increased to 32% towards our goal of 50% of total sales over time. We continue to gain significant market share in Commercial during the fourth quarter, and even with accelerated growth, our market share in the $40 billion Commercial market is less than 5%. Our team knows we have a lot of room for continued growth. Our Commercial gross profit rate also continued to improve, driven by the increase in mix and part sales and better merchandising and operational capabilities. Since we are at the end of our year, I want to take a moment to look back at what we accomplished with our Commercial initiatives in 2009, as well as where our focuses will be in 2010. As we've said in previous calls, we focused our Commercial initiatives on what our customers tell us is most important to them: Have it forwarded to me, deliver it to me quickly and accurately every time. We've now completed investments in additional Parts Pros Trucks and drivers in approximately 1/3 of our stores. These stores have produced comp sales increases significantly higher than our double-digit company average. We'll use the return on these investments as they mature to make investments and additional stores in 2010. We have made investments in the inventory upgrades across many of our stores over the past two years. Kevin has been keeping you up-to-date on both key brands added, as well as increased parts availability. This improvements have contributed significantly to our Commercial growth, and will continue in 2010. We made good progress in 2009 in redefining and aligning the roles and responsibilities of our field and store teams to prepare us for a 50/50 Commercial and DIY sales mix. Being a leader in Commercial requires changes in how our general managers and our key store leaders do their jobs to enable them to serve both DIY and Commercial customers effectively. We also made progress in 2009 in raising the overall operational consistency of our service to our garages. This will be a key focus in 2010 as we expand our use of technology in our stores to receive track and deliver orders consistently and quickly. We believe this will be a key to increasing our retention of existing customers, while continuing to add new customers. In 2009, we built and strengthened our Commercial sales force. For the year, our sales force grew by over 120 Team Members representing a 45% increase from the beginning of the year. While we're not completely where we think we need to be in the size of our sales force, we made substantial progress towards that goal. In 2010, we'll focus on making our sales force more productive by continuing to refine our focus on our most important customers and to build deeper relationships with those customers. In addition to sales growth, we tracked our customer satisfaction scores to measure our progress in Commercial. We are pleased that our satisfaction scores have increased significantly over last year. Also, our net promoter score, the percentage of customers is saying we almost always have the part they need, and the percent of customers who say we almost always deliver the part on a timely basis all showed strong gains. We are also pleased that our customers gave us high scores for taking the time to understand their business which we believe measures the deep relationship we're building. With these initiatives, we believe we have the potential to grow this business in low double digits again in 2010. Now turning to our DIY Transformation, our fourth quarter DIY comp store sales were a negative 0.8% after three consecutive quarters of positive comps. After adjusting for the calendar shift, our comp store sales decreased by roughly 0.4%. Although our fourth quarter year-over-year comparison became significantly more challenging, we're not happy with our fourth quarter results. For the 2009 year, we delivered a comp of 1.7% which was our first full year of positive DIY comp since 2005. Our DIY market share decreased just slightly, about 10 basis points at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the same time in 2008. To put that in perspective, our growth in DIY in 2009 was impacted by the acceleration of store closings, the deceleration of new store openings, reduced marketing spend in the second and third quarters and the absence of an E-commerce platform. However, we made significant steps to strengthen our core capabilities, including marketing, real estate and the establishment of our E-commerce platform, which provide us confidence in our ability to strengthen our relationship with our DIY customers and grow our business with them. As I did with Commercial, I want to take just a moment to look back at what we accomplished with our DIY initiatives in 2009, as well as where our focus will be in 2010. We have focused our DIY initiatives on what our customers tell us is most important: Friendly and knowledgeable people who can solve my problem, are available when I need then and have the part I need when I need it. The parts availability initiatives I described in regard to Commercial apply equally with DIY. We'll continue to increase our parts availability in 2010. In order to ensure our customers have Team Members available when needed, we're improving staffing of our stores based on a demand-driven model that focuses on customer transactions and traffic patterns. The next phase of this process will be rolling out to our stores in the first half of 2010, and we'll provide them more tools to have their staffing available at the right time. We focused significant resources in 2009, especially in the second half of the year on DIY sales training and development. This reinforces the basic reading and problem solving skills of our team. Likewise, the next phase of this training rolls out in the first half of this year. We are also working to employ more effective strategies to increase the number of customers that come to our stores. As we discussed last quarter, we made significant changes to our marketing program and approach. We've implemented a more targeted approach to attract our highest potential customers. Through this work, we established a title sponsorship with Monster Jam which we announced in the fourth quarter. We believe that Monster Jam is a perfect fit for us as their tour footprint aligns very well with our store footprint. Our customer satisfaction scores for DIY have also continued to increase over last year on an already strong base. Again, we're receiving high marks for our increased parts availability, and our net promoting scores increased as well. With these scores and with the initiatives that we're focused on, we believe we can maintain and grow market share over time with our DIY customers who are continuing to aggressively grow our Commercial business. As Darren highlighted, we held our annual general managers conference during the first week of January. This meeting is always a great opportunity for all of us to deepen our focus on building and coaching great store teams and recommitting our sales to doing those things that are essential to meeting our customers' needs. We always come away from this meeting excited by the passion and commitment of our team to serving our customers better than anyone else, which is what makes Advance Auto Parts a special company. Our teams's energy and customer focus will be what leads us to another successful year in 2010. Thanks, again to our team for doing what you're doing each day to serve our customers and drive our results. We look forward to a great 2010. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, Chief Operating Officer, to review our Availability Excellence strategy. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I would also like to thank the team for their hard work during the fourth quarter and 2009. I'll take a minute to highlight a few of the accomplishments during the quarter and year, as well as update you on our initiatives to strengthen our gross profit rate and improve our inventory availability. During the fourth quarter, our gross profit rate increased 78 basis points versus the fourth quarter last year. This increase was on top of a 140-basis-point increase during the same comparable period last year. For the year, our gross profit rate increased 149 basis points to 48.9%. During the quarter, our improvement was driven by increases in both front room and backroom categories, resulting from the rollout of our price optimization strategies, strengthening our merchandising capabilities and the impact of our rapidly growing global sourcing capabilities. For the year, we made significant progress increasing our availability through the net addition of six PDQs, or part delivered quickly warehouses, and 80 HUB stores. We also upgraded inventories in nearly 1,500 stores, and we're able to reassort the vast majority of our plan-o-grams using our new custom mix tool. Through the course of the year, we have substantially disposed of the slow-moving inventory identified in the fourth quarter of last year. Aggressive management of slow moving inventory in 2009 resulted in no material inventory write-offs this year. Major enhancements in inventory management processes led to improved DIY and DIFM availability, and a decrease of over $60 million in own inventory. The 9% decrease in own inventory year-over-year, combined with the 149-basis-point improvement in gross margins, contribute heavily to the 110-basis-point improvement and return on invested capital. Our adjusted accounts payable to inventory ratio of 61.2% is up 400 basis points compared to 57.2% at the end of fourth quarter last year, and is at an all-time high. This significant achievement was evenly split between fewer days of supply and greater days of payables. We are on pace to achieve our long- term goals and expect to see a continued improvement in 2010. As I announced during the third quarter conference call, we have implemented engineered standards at all of our main distribution centers. Engineered standards drove double-digit productivity improvements on the quarter. To date, we have exceeded our expectations through this initiative. We are also exceeding our expectations with respect to our fleet outsourcing we announced earlier in the year. We expect that we will generate significant savings from transportation perspective going forward. The combination of engineered standards and fleet outsourcing allowed us to fund our same day availability investments, and positions us to reduce our supply chain costs as a percent of sales in 2010. While the absence of an E-commerce platform in 2009 reduced our DIY sales in the first three quarters of the year, I am delighted to announce that our E-commerce launch that occurred in October is going well. Our sales in the quarter surpassed our Q4 2008 sales despite spending the previous seven months as an information-only site. Based on our current trend, we believe E-commerce business will continue positively to our DIY business in 2010. We launched the test of our new business-to-business E-commerce site in Q4, and expect to begin a national rollout in 2010. Ultimately, our combined E-commerce platforms should prove to be a significant growth engine for us in the future. In third quarter, I assumed responsibility for Autopart International team in addition to my existing responsibilities. Over the past quarter, I have been working with Roger and his team on developing strategies to accelerate their growth while further identifying opportunities to integrate our supply chain, IT and other back-office capabilities. In 2009, AI's revenue grew 19.6% which was driven by a comp store sales increase of 9.9% and 31 net new stores opened in 2009. We are very pleased with the AI team's results, and I am excited to announce that in 2010, AI will add approximately 40 new stores. Overall, 2009 was a very successful year for our team, and I am thrilled by the strategic and financial progress we've made through our availability excellent strategy. Let me turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated Team Members for the financial progress we made in 2009. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning. One, provide some financial highlights of our 2009 fourth quarter performance; two, put our fourth quarter results into context with our 2009 full year performance and our turnaround; and three, provide you with our annual financial outlook for 2010. Before I comment on our results, I would like to remind you that 2009 includes the impact of store divestitures, and our 2008 fourth quarter and full year results include the impact of both the 53rd week and a non-cash inventory adjustment resulting from a change in inventory management approach. The 53rd week increased diluted EPS by $0.10, while the non-cash inventory adjustment decreased EPS by $0.25. I will speak about our 2009 results on a 12-week and 52-week comparable operating basis, as that provides a more transparent and relevant comparison to 2008 results. We have provided GAAP financials, as well as comparable operating results in our press release. Turning to our fourth quarter, earnings per diluted share of $0.36 included $0.03 related to store divestitures. Excluding the impact of store divestitures, earnings per share were $0.39 versus $0.41 last year and analyst consensus estimates of $0.46. For all of 2009, our earnings per share increased 14% on top of a 16% increase in EPS last year, excluding the $0.17 impact of store divestitures. We shared in our third quarter call that our fourth quarter would be more challenging because we are up against stronger comparisons to last year. While this was the case, we are disappointed that we did not meet our internal expectations for our fourth quarter topline and bottom line performance. That said, we are pleased with the sequential improvements we made in our financial measures for the full year 2009 which I will speak to later in my remarks. Some of the highlights for the fourth quarter include a 2.4% comp store sales increase comprised of a 9.5% increase in Commercial, and a 0.8% decrease in DIY. As previously communicated, our comp store sales were impacted as a result of a calendar shift. On a calendar-adjusted basis, fourth quarter comp store sales increased 3.1%. For fiscal 2009, our comp store sales increased 5.3% over a 1.5% increase in 2008, and our total revenue increased 7.1% on a 52-week adjusted basis. During the fourth quarter, our gross profit rate increased 78 basis points versus last year, primarily  due to continued investments in pricing and merchandising capabilities, increased parts availability and improved store execution, partially offset by the impact of the anniversary of shrink benefits we reported during fourth quarter last year. The 78 basis point increase was on top of 140 basis point gross profit rate improvement in the fourth quarter 2008. On a full year's basis, we are pleased with our 149 basis point increase in gross profit rate, as a result of the investments we've made over the last two years. During the fourth quarter, our SG&A rate increased 165 basis points, excluding the impact of store divestitures. The 165 basis point increase was driven by commercial investments, including store labor, higher benefits expense, additional advertising expense and new capabilities such as global sourcing and E-commerce, partially offset by a reduced incentive compensation. The SG&A rate increase is somewhat magnified given our softer sales performance, and Q4 being a lower volume quarter. Q4 SG&A dollar growth increased 7.8%, which represented lowest SG&A growth in any quarter in 2009. For all of fiscal 2009, the SG&A rate, excluding store divestitures was 125 basis points unfavorable to last year due to investments in store labor, higher incentive compensation, strategic initiative expenses and higher medical expenses, partially offset by lower advertising expense and store occupancy leverage driven by the 5.3% increase in comp store sales. Free cash flow for all of fiscal 2009 was a record $410 million, which represents a 46% increase over last year. This record cash flow increase was $130 million more than 2008, primarily driven by improvements in inventory management, working capital management and increased net income. Adjusting for the 53rd week in 2008, our free cash flow increased $160 million which represented a 64% increase over last year. Our rent adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.2x, which is down from 2.7x last year, driven by last debt outstanding and increase to operating income. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.24 million shares of stock for $50 million at an average share price of $40.24. As mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings release, we have canceled the remaining share repurchase authorization, and our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program. We will continue to be opportunistic with the share repurchases in 2010, and are committed to managing our rent adjusted leverage ratio to a maximum 2.5x. Overall, we are disappointed that our fourth quarter results trailed our financial expectations from both a top line and bottom line standpoint. We have previously shared that our financial performance would not be linear quarter-to-quarter, given the breadth of changes we have made as part of our turnaround, and we saw this with our results in the fourth quarter. As we now end our turnaround phase, it's also important that we put our fourth quarter financial results in context with our full year 2009 financial performance. In 2009, our comp store sales grew 5.3%, our total revenue growth outpaced the rest of the market by 390 basis points, our operating income grew 10%, our return on invested capital increased 110 basis points and we delivered record free cash flow of $410 million. Sometimes these improvements can be lost when we focus on just one quarter. As previously shared, our turnaround has been about positioning the company to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value. These three dimensions will continue to be how we measure the path ahead, and our performance thus far shows we are trending in the right direction. Turning to growth, we are pleased with the 5% improvement we made in sales per square foot in 2009, and the fact that our total business growth, as measured by NPD, was 390 basis points better than the rest of the market, driven by our strong commercial growth. Looking ahead, we are focused on building an integrated store that service both our DIY and Commercial customers, and we will measure our performance based on the total four-wall sales growth. Turning to profit. We are pleased with the 149 basis points gross profit rate expansion and the sequential growth we have seen in our operating income in 2009 versus 2008. Looking ahead, we expect the significant investments we have made in our capabilities and infrastructure will drive continued operating income expansion. Turning to value creation, we are pleased with our $410 million record free cash flow in 2009. Improvements in our balance sheet, driven by our inventory management and reduced debt, and 110 basis point increase in our return on invested capital. Looking ahead, we expect to turn and leverage the strong financial platform we have built into continued growth in economic profit. Turning to fiscal 2010, we provided a more robust annual outlook in our press release, which is included in our 2010 estimated EPS range of $3.20 to $3.40 per share. I would like to remind you that our first quarter has the most challenging comparison to last year, which will limit our ability to grow first quarter operating income which is factored into our annual outlook. Now I'd like to provide you with the key financial assumptions applied in our annual financial outlook. In 2010, we will continue to expand our store base, and anticipate new store openings will increase in 2009 levels for both Advance and Autopart International brands to approximately 150 stores. We will continue to make investments to grow our Commercial business and to improve our DIY sales performance which we expect will result in total four wall comp store sales increase in the low to approaching mid-single digits. We also see the third straight year of continued gross profit rate expansion as a result of our previous investments in merchandising and inventory management capabilities, and from benefits as a result of recent investments and capabilities such as global sourcing. Turning to our cost structure. We expect that our SG&A growth will decelerate in 2010. The past two years required large SG&A investments to build the foundational and strategic capabilities needed to turnaround our business. A large portion of these investments have now become part of our 2010 cost base, which will result in reduced growth in our SG&A. We must also ensure we get the appropriate yield from both our fixed and variable expenses. For example, we expect some of the capability initiatives for 2010 in areas such as labor management, commercial operations, and field implementation; will help us improve our productivity and yield in areas such as labor, our commercial programs and our variability and store performance. Additionally, we expect to see reduced costs from some of the areas we invested in 2009 such as outsourcing goods not for resale and our DC fleet. While we expect to see a deceleration in SG&A spending compared to previous higher levels, we are still under transformation that requires continued strategic investments in areas such as Commercial, E-commerce and global sourcing, along with the fact we will be annualizing partial year investments in 2009. Before investments, we expect SG&A to leverage at low single-digit comps. All in, with investments, we expect SG&A per store to grow approximately mid-single digits in 2010. We expect higher SG&A dollar growth during the first two quarters of 2010, which will result in higher comp sales leverage point as a result of investments we made during the second half of 2009. In closing, we are disappointed we did not deliver the financial results we expected in our fourth quarter, yet our full year 2009 financial results showed we are on the right path. As we enter 2010, we remain committed and focused on our four strategies that are allowing us to build a differentiated model to serve both our DIY and commercial customers. We continue to see a pathway to improve our operating and financial results, and continue to be optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. Most importantly, we are appreciative of our talented Team Members who are passionately leading us through our transformation. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

To be notified of future dates of earnings reports, you can sign up through the Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for one year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 51,000 Team Members for their hard work and congratulate them on an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and for the 2010 fiscal year. Our team reached many record milestones this year, both strategically and financially. A few of the milestones I'm most proud of include our tremendous growth in our Commercial programs, which have generated three consecutive years of double-digit comparable store sales growth. Our year-end customer traction and market share results set new records, and our Team Member calibration and engagement scores also reached all-time highs. Finally, our overall financial performance on sales and margins, profits and returns exceed expectations. Specific highlights for 2010 include our commitment to serve customers, which continued to fuel our growth and profitability, driving an 8% comp store sales gain and a total sales growth of 9.5% for the year. Our operating income rate rose to 9.9%, driven by our gross profit rate, which reached 50% of sales. Our earnings per share jumped 31.7%, with our return on invested capital climbing to 17.5%. Mike will provide more specific detail on the fourth quarter and full year results in a few minutes. Our organizational and strategic results were just as gratifying. The revitalizing of our core values, which are to inspire, serve and grow, coupled with the successful execution of our four strategies, stand out as our most important accomplishment that contributed to our 2010 performance. The key highlights include our ability to inspire as reflected in the quality of our Team Members and the number of ASE-certified Team Members, which now is nearly 7,000 and growing. Our commitment to serve our customers better than anyone else is reflected in our new highs and inventory availability and Team Member service factors according to NPD. Our growth results are reflected in the consistent and profitable execution of our four key strategies, starting with Commercial Acceleration, which generated double-digit comp growth in Commercial each and every quarter over the past three years, resulting in average Commercial programs growing from $414,000 to $593,000 annually for Advance stores. DIY Transformation resulted in the development of our ""Service is our best part"" brand promise, while supporting our industry-leading sales per store. Availability Excellence extended our gross profit rate 335 basis points over the past three years, while lowering our own inventory per store by 28%. Superior Experience has driven improvements in our overall customer satisfaction, while our customer-driven labor model and e-commerce site have enhanced our customer shopping experience. Looking to 2011, the vital signs of our industry continue to be very favorable. The average age of vehicle on the road is over 10 years, with nearly 2/3 of those vehicles greater than seven years old. Miles driven have continued to increase modestly and consumer preference still favors necessity as a result of the sluggish economy and job market. Yet, we do see potential headwinds, such as rising gas prices and rebounding U.S. auto market and the associated increase in seasonally adjusted sales. In addition, the challenging weather conditions in many of our core markets have led to a very tough start to the year. Q1 will be lower than our original plans and vision and as usual, we have adjusted our annual outlook to reflect our start to the year. History still shows us that weather tends to even out through the course of the year. 2010 was definitely an exception to that rule, as weather favorably impacted us all year. However, there is nothing to lead us to believe that 2011 will be another exception, and we are early enough in the quarter and the year to make adjustments to deliver another successful year. Turning to a longer-term view, our focus over the last several years was to catch up on mission-critical capabilities including commercial sales, e-commerce, merchandising and field leadership to name a few, while reigniting our focus and commitment to our customers and Team Members. We certainly have closed the gap from that vantage point as indicated in our record-level customer and Team Member satisfaction. Research concludes that the customers see very little difference between leading players in our industry. As a matter of fact, last month, I received a letter addressed to the Advance AutoZone Parts' CEO. I'm still not sure if I should open it. So when the customers had nothing else to remember their experience, they simply talk about price and location. Our greatest opportunity to differentiate Advance is by providing an experience that is more meaningful and memorable than price and location. Looking forward, we will focus on a single customer promise: ""Service is our best part."" ""Service is our best part"" was the theme of our 2011 Leaders Forum that was held earlier this quarter with 4,500 of our frontline leaders. I've never experienced so much enthusiasm and galvanizing focus from a team. As we shared with the team our strategies that enable ""Service is our best part,"" enable converge from four to two, service leadership and superior availability will simplify our focus and allow us to strengthen our integrated service model for our DIY Commercial and AI customers around the shared commitment. Our superior availability commitment will be to get the right part to the right place at the right time every time. It compels us to maximize the storage capacity of our stores and warehouses as well as increase our delivery speed to our customers. This strategy will be a multi-year journey to revolutionize availability and lower our supply chain cost, resulting in increased profitability. Service leadership will leverage on superior availability. Our service leadership commitment is to lead with the right services and the right support at the right time and the right way. Jim and Kevin will provide additional insights regarding service leadership and superior availability in just a few moments. Collectively, ""Service is our best part"" will seek to separate Advance over the next five years from an industry dominated by a property, parts and price promise. I expect our service leadership and superior availability strategies will allow us to maintain our industry-leading sales per store while growing our operating margins to 12% and return on invested capital to 20%. While we believe our sales per store potential is nearly $2.5 million, our goal over the next several years is to achieve $2 million per store driven by our growth in Commercial as we move towards becoming a fully integrated service model. Ultimately, my confidence is driven by the quality, passion and track records of the Advance leaders. In January, at our leadership conference, we had the opportunity to recognize a member of our team that brings our value proposition and brand to life every day. That team member was Mike Byrd. Mike was recognized as our Regional Vice President of the year. Mike started working for Advance while he was in college and worked his way up through the company over the past 20 years, holding various leadership roles within our field operation. His region is the leader in all key metrics, and he truly has a passion for service leadership. Leaders like Mike who are driving our business demonstrate how we will win with the customer and differentiate ourselves in 2011 and beyond. Congratulations, Mike, and thanks for all you do. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim Wade, our President, to discuss our service leadership strategy. Jimmie L. Wade Former Director Thank you, Darren, and good morning. As always, I want to start by thanking our hard-working and committed team for another record quarter and year. We appreciate our team's passion for providing great service to our DIY and Commercial customers, and earning their business one customer at a time and doing it through our core values. I want to spend my time this morning taking a look back at our results for the fourth quarter and then talking about how we're bringing service leadership to life in 2011. In the fourth quarter, our team continued to do a great job executing our initiatives as well as leveraging the strong industry fundamentals to produce strong results. Our total comp store sales grew by 8.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.4% during the same quarter in 2009. Consistent with the first three quarters of 2010, we are pleased with an increase in both the number of customer transactions as well as the average transaction size. Each of our major geographic areas produced positive comps in DIY and double-digit comps in Commercial, resulting in a very consistent performance across our company. We reached a few milestones in our Commercial business that we're very proud of. The fourth quarter marked our 12th consecutive quarter or three full years of double-digit Commercial comp in our Advance Auto Parts stores. In those three years, our total Commercial sales have grown by 57%, and now represent 34% of our total sales compared to 27% just three years ago. We now have over 40% more Commercial parts pros, truck drivers and sales force in place since three years ago when we committed the resources to accelerate our Commercial share. Those resources were invested in the customer. We're very excited that we finished the 2010 year with the highest customer satisfaction scores from our Commercial customers that we've ever achieved. We believe this is a true measure of our future potential in this business. Our DIY business again produced strong growth and achieved our seventh quarter of positive DIY comps in the last eight quarters, with solid positive comp each quarter in 2010. Our DIY customer satisfaction scores continue to increase as well. We continue to generate the highest sales per store in our industry, and we gained market share during the quarter and for the year. In our stores, we will focus on several key areas in 2011 that will enable us to serve our customers with dependable and fast service consistently in every store, every day by every Advance Team Member. We believe that to provide a great customer experience, we must achieve a new standard of operational service excellence, and that has to be brought to life for the customer by our team. In order to enable a high level of operational and service commitment, we'll focus on the following: We've increased the number of district leaders and reduced their average store count, so they'll have more time to spend in their stores coaching and developing the team. We'll increase the clarity of what's operationally critical for our district leaders and general managers to focus on to achieve consistent foundational excellence in every store, and we'll continue to measure our progress. We'll continue to build on our customer-driven staffing to ensure we have the right people at the right time to align with our customer traffic. We'll further accelerate our team member training and development in both parts knowledge and selling skills to better enable them to find solutions for their customers. We'll build stronger relationships with our highest potential Commercial customers through the partnership of our store teams and sales force to visit and support those customers. We'll measure and we'll improve our delivery times and order accuracy to our Commercial customers, which will enable them to be more successful in taking care of their customers. We'll spread our message through our advertising and marketing programs to drive new customers to consider us and to build our brand around our team. And we'll leverage to its fullest potential the increased parts availability that Kevin will describe, along with all the tools his team is providing, so we can find the right part and get it to the customer fast. As Darren mentioned, we held our Annual Leaders Forum in January where we had the opportunity to spend time with all our general managers, our field team and our sales force and to review our plans for 2011. We're very excited about our teams' commitment, and we know that it will be through their commitment and passion that will bring ""Service is our best part"" to life for every customer. Lastly, we continue to reach new customers and grow our sales through successful new store openings. During the fourth quarter, we opened 26 stores including three Autopart International stores and closed three stores. For the year, we opened 148 stores including 38 AI stores, and closed five. As of the end of our fourth quarter, our total store count was 3,563 including 194 Autopart International stores. In closing, thanks again to our team for another successful year and for remaining committed to leading inspired teams and delivering on our promise that service is our best part. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss our superior availability strategy. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I would also like to congratulate the team for a strong fourth quarter and year. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to support our superior availability strategy. During the fourth quarter, our gross profit rate increased 147 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2009. The fourth quarter improvement was driven by increases in both front room and back room categories resulting from the rollout of our custom mix and price optimization strategies, the strengthening of our merchandising capabilities and the impact of our rapidly growing global sourcing capabilities. We continue to be pleased with the strides that we've made in improving our gross profit rate, which has increased 335 basis points in the past three years. Through our custom mix rollouts, we completed 163 upgrades during the quarter. We continue to improve our category sales and margin rate performance in Hard Parts as a result of our increased availability and continued strength in our Commercial business. Our sales and margins in accessories also improved in the quarter and continued to benefit from our new global sourcing capability. During the fourth quarter, we continued to improve our parts availability through the addition of eight HUB stores. Our delivery HUB network is at 176, providing multiple daily deliveries to 2,300 stores, in addition to our 31 PDQs. In 2010, our DC productivity improved double-digits over 2009 due to the continued focus on labor standards and productivity initiatives. Our adjusted accounts payable to inventory ratio increased significantly from 61.2% to 71% at the end of fourth quarter. Our increase in AP ratio continues to be driven by more favorable payment terms, supply chain financing and the timing of inventory purchases, while our owned inventory decreased by $94 million versus 2009, while we continue to increase the amount of inventory throughout our system as inventory per store increased 10% over the fourth quarter of last year. The customer perception of product availability continues to increase and exceeded our internal expectations for the year. Our superior availability strategy is focused on driving industry-leading parts availability. We continue to be thrilled with the progress of our DIY e-commerce platform, with sequential increases in all key metrics: traffic, conversion rates and sales. We're excited about the completion of the rollout of our business-to-business e-commerce capabilities, with the ability to provide our customers with increased convenience and a better experience through our new online capability. Our B2B capability gives us confidence that we continue to drive strong Commercial sales growth by strengthening our competitive position and enabling us to do business with more customers and larger bay garage customers. In the fourth quarter, AI's revenue grew 33%, driven by the net addition of 38 stores over the past 12 months and a positive comp performance. Overall, our fourth quarter, as well as 2010, was very successful for our team, and I'm thrilled by the strategic and financial progress we've made as we focus on providing superior availability. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated Team Members for their contributions to the financial progress we made in our fourth quarter and for fiscal 2010. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights from our 2010 fourth quarter; two, put our fourth quarter results into context with both our full year performance and the key financial dimensions of our transformation over the past three years; and three, provide you with our annual financial outlook for 2011. As a reminder, our fiscal 2009 results included the impact of store divestitures, which decreased diluted earnings per share by $0.03 during the fourth quarter last year and $0.17 for fiscal 2009. I will speak about our year-over-year results versus 2009 on a comparable operating basis, excluding the impact of 2009 store divestitures, to provide a more transparent and relevant comparison. We have provided both GAAP and comparable operating results in our earnings release. Looking at our fourth quarter, we were very pleased with our strong end to the year, with earnings per diluted share of $0.57 versus $0.39 last year, a 46% increase or a 58% increase on a GAAP basis. For the full year, our earnings per diluted share increased 32% on a comparable basis to $3.95, which was on top of a 14% increase in 2009. On a GAAP basis, our diluted earnings per share increased 40% over 2009. Our comparable store sales increased 8.9% during the fourth quarter, which was on top of a 2.4% comp increase during the fourth quarter 2009, representing an 11.3% two-year comp store sales increase. Our fourth quarter comps were driven by our 12th consecutive double-digit comp increase in Commercial, our seventh quarter out of the last eight quarters of positive DIY comps and strong online sales. For the year, our comp store sales increased 8%, with total sales increasing 9.5% to over $5.9 billion. As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate increased 147 basis points versus 2009 and continues to be driven by improved merchandising and pricing capabilities, improved parts availability and supply chain efficiencies. The 147 basis point increase was on top of a 78 basis point increase in gross profit last year in the fourth quarter 2009. For the full year, our gross profit rate increased 113 basis points and now stands at a record high of 50%. This is a significant achievement, given the strong growth of our Commercial business, which now represents 34% of our 2010 sales versus 32% in 2009. Our SG&A rate of 42.8% increased 20 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2009, primarily due to higher incentive compensation resulting from our strong 2010 performance compared to our soft fourth quarter of 2009 combined with the deliberate decision to pull forward in 2011 expenses in Commercial and availability into our fourth quarter as we highlighted during our third quarter call. However, these increases were almost entirely offset by expense leverage in our fixed-cost structure as a result of our strong fourth quarter comp sales increase of 8.9%. For the full year, our SG&A rate increased to 40.1%, a 13 basis point increase versus fiscal 2009. Our operating income increased 38% versus the fourth quarter of 2009, and our operating income rate increased 127 basis points to 6.6%. Our full year operating income increased 22% versus fiscal 2009. Our operating income rate increased to 9.9% of sales for fiscal 2010, which represents 100 basis point increase versus 2009 on a comparable operating basis. Free cash flow through the year was a record $466.4 million, which represents a $56.5 million increase over last year. This increase was primarily due to our strong growth in net income and reduced owned inventory. Our accounts payable to inventory ratio increased to 71% from 61.2% in 2009 as part of our continued efforts to reduce our net owned inventory, which decreased $94 million versus 2009. Our consistent and sequential improvements in our operating and financial performance over the past three years, along with our disciplined approach to managing our capital investments, reinforce our commitment to accelerate growth, improve profitably and drive shareholder value. We will continue to measure our financial performance based on these three dimensions. Our commitment to growing our business is reflected by our 8% increase in comp sales in 2010 and industry-leading sales per store, which grew 6.4% to $1.7 million. Our sales per store have increased $170,000 over the past three years. Our ability to grow profitability is marked by consistent and continued gross profit expansion and an increased operating income rate, which grew 113 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively. Over the past three years, our gross profit rate and operating income rate have expanded by 335 basis points and 130 basis points, respectively. As we look at our ability to drive shareholder value, we are pleased with our 240 basis point increase in ROIC to 17.5% over 2009, a 44% increase in economic profit added over the past 12 months and our 2010 record free cash flow of $466 million. Over the past three years, our ROIC has grown 380 basis points, and our free cash flow has doubled. Our performance was also recognized externally in 2010, with our uprates by Moody's and S&P bringing us to full investment-grade status. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 million shares for $157.8 million at an average price of $66.71. That brought our total share repurchases for 2010 to 13 million shares for $633.9 million at an average price of $48.67. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2011, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $121.6 million at an average price of $62.72. These repurchases reflect our views of our low valuation and our internal confidence in our company's ability to grow profitability and to create long-term shareholder value. As we stated in our press release, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program. Overall, 2010 marked our third year of improved financial and operational performance. While our performance in 2010 was definitely buoyed by favorable weather patterns and strong industry dynamics, the strategic choices we have made through our investments and the superior execution of our team played a significant role and have allowed us to gain market share and position our company for long-term growth and success. Turning to fiscal 2011, we estimate our EPS will range from $4.60 to $4.80 per share and reflects the share repurchases up to the time of this release. Our outlook estimates an average share count of approximately $82 million of outstanding diluted shares. Now I'd like to provide you with the key financial assumptions implied in our annual financial outlook. In 2011, we will continue to expand our store base and anticipate new store openings for both Advance and Autopart International brands to be approximately 130 to 140 stores. Our focus on service leadership and superior availability will fuel continued growth in our industry-leading sales per store. We expect comp sales to grow in the low to mid-single-digits driven by strong Commercial growth and the resurgence of DIY. We expect our gross profit rate to continue to expand, however, at a much more moderate pace. We will continue to reap the benefits of our previous investments and merchandising capabilities, supply chain and availability, including areas such as global sourcing. However, we expect some headwinds to margin from supply chain investments to fuel superior availability as well as some potential inflationary headwinds in certain commodities that will constrain gross profit expansion. Turning to our cost structure. Differentiation will require continued investments in the areas of service leadership and superior availability. We have demonstrated over the past three years that investing in the right initiatives can deliver solid growth and returns as evidenced by our strong operational and financial performance, and we are committed to the same discipline as we embark on differentiation. That said, we expect SG&A dollar growth per store to continue to decelerate in 2011 from 2010, driven by cost savings in areas of labor management, operational efficiencies and variability in store performance. These savings will somewhat offset our 2011 investment spend and will result in our SG&A leveraging at a lower level of comp store sales. We also expect capital expenditures to increase in 2010 to a range of $275 million to $300 million, principally driven by supply chain investments as part of our superior availability. These investments include new technology such as a new warehouse management system that will take us to the next level of enhanced availability and supply chain productivity and capacity investments including a new distribution center in Remington, Indiana, required to meet our future growth needs. With our strong fourth quarter, where we accelerated our market share growth and customer scores, we expected our first quarter 2011 to build on that momentum. While we do not provide quarterly outlooks, we have gotten off to a significantly slower start than we anticipated. We know weather has impacted the start, and we continue to monitor other drivers. We now anticipate first quarter comp growth could be flat to low single-digits, which could constrain our first quarter earnings. It is early enough in the year where we can adjust our plans as we learn more. I would also like to remind you that our first and third quarters represent the most challenging comparisons on a two-year basis, and both were significantly benefited by favorable weather patterns in 2010. We continue to believe the long-term industry dynamics are still in place. We have factored all of this into our annual EPS outlook. In closing, Advance Auto Parts has been focused on becoming more competitive within our industry, and we are pleased with our progress. We are focused on becoming differentiated and a fully integrated service model. Ultimately, we will win with our customers through service leadership and superior availability. We expect to continue to build upon the momentum of the previous three years and we'll continue to be guided by meeting the needs of our customers and measure our financial progress through growth, profitability and value creation. Our talented team will continue to propel us forward and ultimately help us reach our full potential. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. First, I'd like to thank our 52,000 Team Members for their hard work and congratulate them on an outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2011. The team's focus and dedication enabled us to achieve new record levels of performance this year. Our continued investment in service and availability translated into industry-leading service experience as measured by NPD, while improving the efficiency of our operations. Together, these investments resulted in record profitability as reflected in our 90 basis point improvement in our operating income rate, which reached an all-time high of 10.8%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 12%. Our improved operating performance enabled our full year earnings per share to grow 29.4% to $5.11, while our return on invested capital reached a record 19.5%. Mike will provide more specific details on the fourth quarter and our full year results in a few minutes, as well as the outlook for 2012. Our heritage is grounded in our commitment to service and is reflected in our promise ""Service is our best part."" Just as important, our values, inspire, serve and grow, are critical to how we deliver on our promise on a consistent basis. Together, our team's dedication to our promise and values resulted in record levels of customer satisfaction, Team Member engagement and financial returns in 2011. Operationally, we set new standards of achievement in delivery speed, reliability, inventory on hand and e-commerce sales, to name a few. Finally, we finished the year slightly below double-digit comps in our Commercial business and saw sequential improvements in DIY throughout 2011. We entered 2011 by simplifying our strategies to service leadership and superior availability. Service leadership, in simple terms, is to help customers buy through delivering on customer expectations, which requires a relentless focus on service basics and behaviors. We made material investments in our district leadership team, the measurement of commercial delivery speed and reliability, and our service leadership assessments. Ultimately, our goal is to maximize the value of each customer engagement, whether it's when a customer walks into one of our stores, calls us or clicks on our website. Superior availability is focused on building an industry-leading supply chain through our efforts to build out our hub network and implement our new warehouse management system. This new warehouse management system is a critical element of our state-of-the-art distribution center set to open in the fall of 2012. Kevin Freeland will provide you with more insights on our progress under our superior availability strategy shortly. I am pleased with the strategic progress we made, as well as our financial results that accelerated throughout the year. Specifically, we were able to generate a 2.9% comp store sales gain during our fourth quarter and a 2.2% for the fiscal year. Overall, our business continues to be impacted by regionality but was less so in the fourth quarter. Our performance for the year was driven by solid results in both our failure and maintenance products. In our fourth quarter, we saw positive growth in both DIY and Commercial. In 2011, Commercial comps were strong, giving us near double-digit comps for 4 years in a row. We slowed the pace of our Commercial weighs in 2011 to focus on and achieve better execution, which enabled us to better manage our integrated service model. We are delighted by our ability to turn the tide in DIY, despite a very tough comparison, through improved execution and increased average ticket. Overall, we continue to outperform the market and gain significant market share in our rapidly growing Commercial business, which represented 37.2% of our total sales in the fourth quarter versus 35.1% during the fourth quarter last year. Additionally, we are pleased with our improved top line and bottom line performance of our commercially focused Autoparts International business. AI grew to nearly $295 million in sales, with an 8.6% comp store sales increase while increasing profits nearly 3x to $12.3 million for the year. We continue to see significant potential to grow our Commercial business and to gain market share. By contrast, we underperformed the industry and our expectations for DIY market share in 2011. Our team is focused on the basics of execution, merchandising and marketing to build on our Q4 gains in DIY. We are pleased with both our DIY and Commercial sales trends as we start 2012. A special highlight is our continued effort to serve the communities in which we operate. This is reflected in our work to increase awareness and seek a cure for juvenile diabetes. Our team once again continued our strong efforts in support of JDRF by raising roughly $4 million this year. Our fundraising total since 1994 is now over $30 million, and we continue to be JDRF's #1 corporate partner. Looking to 2012 and beyond, we continue to see strong structural elements of our industry, including the increasing average age of vehicles, which is nearly 11 years, with 2/3 of those cars on the road being over 7 years old. With over 240 million cars in the U.S., this continues to be a major driver of the long-term growth and stability of the industry. Our economy continues to be tempered with high unemployment and low consumer confidence. As a result, we expect to see an economy of necessity, where consumers will continue to favor and seek value through local garages or performing needed repairs themselves. In the shorter term and with stabilization of gas prices, we expect the industry in 2012 to perform comparably to 2011. However, increases in gas prices at the pump will have a negative impact on the growth potential of the industry, as evidenced in 2011. As we start a new year, we remain focused on service leadership and superior availability and the elements that support our strategies. Our success will be determined by our ability to run the business with excellence, which is based upon providing outstanding service, growing DIY and accelerating Commercial, effectively managing our inventory levels, continuing to increase the effectiveness of our Team Member training and development while allowing us to retain, hire and ignite the performance of our outstanding Team Members. In 2012, our key organizational priorities include the continued focus on improving our in-market availability through the continued expansion of our hub network and the opening of our new DC during the back half of the year. We continue to enhance our e-commerce offerings in order to increase the retention and acquisition of larger size commercial customers. We will continue our efforts to increase the penetration of B2B, which has been very well received by our commercial customers. Finally, we will work to maximize our return on every customer visit by providing the service they want and expect from every Team Member. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge our team's everyday heroics, simply serving their customers better than anyone else. These acts of heroism happen every day in one of our stores, such as Millsboro, Delaware, where TJ Marshlack [ph] and Thomas Lacasse [ph] deliver on our promise, despite the cold temperatures, by installing a battery for a mom and her young son and testing the car's charging system to ensure the job was done right, and we gained a customer for life; or in Topeka, Kansas, where General Manager Chris Anders takes great pride in being available for our customers, connects with them in a meaningful way by taking them from an ordinary transaction and turning it into a memorable interaction. Thank you to all of our everyday heroes as your acts of heroism are what makes Advance a great place to work and will continue to drive our success way into the future. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to congratulate the team for a strong fourth quarter and year. I'll take a moment to highlight a few of our accomplishments during the quarter, as well as update you on our initiatives to support superior availability strategy and new store growth. Over the course of the year, we worked to increase the breadth and depth of our in-market product assortment and availability through our efforts to increase the number of hubs in the marketplace, as well as providing delivery capabilities from strategically positioned hubs. As a result, we've worked aggressively to add our number of hub stores in 2011, which now sits at 294, or an increase of 68 since Q4 of 2010. We upgraded the inventory in 47 stores for the quarter and 814 stores for the year. As a direct result of our hub strategy and our inventory upgrades, our in-stock levels were up nearly 90 basis points over last year and are at a record high. Despite our start to 2011, when our inventory levels increased 21% during the first quarter, our inventory levels at the end of the year were up only 9.6% versus the prior year. This is a great accomplishment, and I want to congratulate our inventory team as their focus on disciplined inventory management allowed us to exceed our goals by sequentially decelerating the rate of growth each quarter while continuing to build our -- build on our already high level of customer perception of availability. Additionally, we continued to expand our supply chain financing program and have reduced our owned inventory per store by 29.8%, with our total owned inventory decreasing $150 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. Our work in this space has led to an increase in our AP ratio of nearly 1,000 basis points versus the fourth quarter last year and now stands at 80.9%. We continue to be encouraged by our progress, and will continue to work to expand our AP ratio in the future. Turning to gross profit. Our gross profit declined 39 basis points to 49% versus the fourth quarter of the previous year. This anticipated decline continues to be impacted by increased supply chain costs driven by our investments in hub stores and increased deliveries. Additionally, our gross profit decline was impacted by unfavorable shrink. However, we continue to make great strides with respect to our shrink management. Our shrink performance has improved since second quarter, and we anticipate this headwind will subside in the back half of 2012. Partially offsetting those headwinds in 2011 were continued improvements in DC productivity and continued benefits from our merchandising, global sourcing and pricing capabilities. While gross margin declined 24 basis points in 2011, it increased 312 basis points over the last 4 years. Our new Remington, Indiana, DC will begin receiving product in the second quarter of 2012 and is anticipated to begin shipping product the following quarter. Remington will provide us with much needed capacity and will be by far the most advanced DC within our supply chain. Once this new DC is up and running, we'll be able to benefit from additional productivity improvements and continue to increase our overall availability. We continue to reach new customers and grow sales through successful expansion of our e-commerce capabilities and through new store openings. During the fourth quarter, we opened 19 stores, closed 1 Advance store and closed 1 Autopart International store. For fiscal 2011, we opened 95 Advance stores, 9 Autopart International stores, closed 4 Advance stores and 1 Autopart International store. As of December 31, 2011, the company's total store count was 3,662, including 202 Autopart International stores. Overall, our fourth quarter as well as 2011 was very successful for our team, and I'm thrilled by the strategic and financial progress we've made as we focus on providing superior availability. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated Team Members for their contribution to the strong financial outcomes we delivered in our fourth quarter to close out another very solid year. I plan to cover the following 3 topics with you this morning: one, provide some financial highlights from our fourth quarter of 2011; two, put our fourth quarter results into context with both our full year performance and the key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, provide you with our annual financial outlook for 2012. Looking at our fourth quarter, we are pleased with our strong end of the year, with earnings per diluted share increasing 57.9% to $0.90 per share versus $0.57 for the prior year. For all of 2011, our earnings per share increased 29.4% to $5.11 on top of a 31.7% EPS increase in 2010. Our comp store sales increased 2.9% during the fourth quarter, which was on top of an 8.9% comp increase during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, representing an 11.8% 2-year comp store sales increase. We are very pleased with this result as it marks our strongest comp performance for the year despite challenging comparisons. For the year, our comp store sales increased 2.2%, with total sales increasing 4.1% to nearly $6.2 billion. As Kevin mentioned, our gross profit rate in the fourth quarter was 49% versus 49.4% in the fourth quarter 2010, or a decrease of 39 basis points. This was in line with our expectations. The decline versus prior year was primarily driven by increased supply chain investments in hubs and slightly higher shrink expense. For the year, our gross profit rate decreased 24 basis points to 49.7%, which was in line with our previous outlook and expectations. Turning to our cost structure. Our SG&A rate was 40.6% during the fourth quarter versus 42.8% during the fourth quarter of 2010. This 221 basis point decrease was driven by productivity improvements from the company's variable customer-driven labor model, which includes the anniversary of investment rollout expenses, reduced incentive compensation as a result of the company's lower comp sales growth versus the fourth quarter of 2010, occupancy cost leverage, and a significant decrease in overall support costs. The expense reductions were partially offset by continued strategic investments in areas such as commercial, availability and e-commerce. As a result of our cost management efforts and a continued commitment to building a more competitive cost structure, our SG&A per store decreased 2.2% in 2011 to $666,000 per store. As a direct result of our team's execution and commitment to achieve both top line growth and improve our cost structure, our operating income increased 33.3% versus fourth quarter of 2010 while our operating income rate increased 182 basis points to 8.4%. Our full year operating income increased 13.6% versus fiscal 2010 to $664.6 million. Our operating income rate increased to a record 10.8% of sales in fiscal 2011, which represents a 90-basis-point increase, which was on top of a 100-basis-point increase in 2010. We are delighted by these results and pleased with our team's progress in growing our business and profitability. Free cash flow was a record $507.2 million, which represents a $40.9 million increase over last year. This increase was primarily due to our strong growth in net income and reduced owned inventory. As Kevin mentioned, our reduction in owned inventory was driven by our efforts to increase our AP to inventory ratio, which is now at 80.9%, up nearly 1,000 basis points from 71% in 2010, and our work to decelerate the pace of growth of our overall inventory levels, which grew 9.6% for the year. These improvements to our free cash flow were partially offset by our increased capital spending, which was up $90.6 million, driven by our strategic investments in supply chain to improve our efficiencies, to complete our Remington DC and investments in our e-commerce business. At the end of Q4, we had $416 million of debt on our balance sheet, and our adjusted debt to EBITDAR was 2x, which is below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. Last month, we obtained long-term funding through our $300 million unsecured senior notes offering, which will be used to pay off short-term debt and for other general corporate purposes. This was part of our capital structure plan to continue to improve our financial foundation by securing longer term funding at favorable terms, which will help fund our future growth. With respect to share repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 9.9 million shares of stock for $609.6 million at an average price of $61.51 per share during fiscal 2011. These repurchases continue to reflect our confidence in the company's ability to grow profitably and to create long-term shareholder value. Strategically, we continue to position the company for growth and improved profitability. Our performance in our fourth quarter and 2011 demonstrates we are on the right path and reinforces our commitment to accelerate growth, improve profitability and drive shareholder value. We continue to measure our performance based on these 3 dimensions. Our commitment to grow our business is reflected by our fourth consecutive year of strong Commercial sales growth, which continues to drive record sales per store. Over the past 4 years, our sales per store have increased $181,000 to $1.71 million, driven by increased Commercial sales per program, which has grown 45% over the same period. Our ability to grow profitably is marked by our 190-basis-point improvement in operating income rate in the past 2 years, driven by the structural improvements we had made to our gross profit in the areas such as parts availability, inventory management and new capability such as global sourcing and e-commerce, and through the improvements we have made in our cost structure. We continue to be on pace to achieve 12% operating margins. Turning to shareholder value. We continue to maintain our disciplined approach in managing our balance sheet and capital structure as reflected in our 19.5% return on invested capital, which increased 200 basis points versus 2010 and 580 basis points over the past 4 years. The increase in ROIC and the 116% increase in our free cash flow over the past 4 years were primarily due to our improved operating performance, as well as our continued efforts to reduce our owned inventory. Turning to 2012. We believe it will be another strong year given the solid industry fundamentals Darren mentioned, and we look to build on our 2011 momentum with our relentless focus on service to meet our customers' needs and continued investments in commercial, availability and e-commerce. We estimate our 2012 EPS will be $5.55 to $5.75 per share. This annual outlook reflects a weighted average share count of approximately 74 million outstanding diluted shares and includes additional interest expense from our recent unsecured notes issuance. Now I'd like to provide you with the key financial assumptions implied in our annual financial outlook. In 2012, we anticipate new store openings for both Advance and Autopart International brands to be approximately 120 to 130 stores. Service leadership and superior availability will fuel continued sales per store growth. We expect comp sales to grow low- to mid-single digits, driven by continued growth in Commercial. We expect a modest improvement in our gross profit rate as we continue to reap the benefits of our previous investments, our focus on excellence in terms of inventory and shrink management, and the anniversary of supply chain efficiencies. Partially offsetting these margin benefits are headwinds associated with the ramp up of our new Remington DC that will come online during our third quarter of fiscal 2012, our new warehouse management system, and the increased mix of Commercial sales. Turning to our cost structure. We continue to see opportunities to increase our productivity, reduce the variability of our store performance and reduce support costs furthest away from the customer. We expect to continue the progress we made in 2011. However, our focus on growth will continue to require us to make investments in areas such as commercial, supply chain, global sourcing and e-commerce. Based on our comp sales outlook, our incentive compensation may be leveraged as a result of slightly higher sales and year-over-year growth in 2012. All in, our strategic investments, combined with more normalized incentive compensation, will be partially offset through our continued efforts to improve our cost structure and simplify our operations. We anticipate that our SG&A per store will increase in the low- single digits. Turning to capital expenditures. We expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $275 million to $300 million, which is slightly higher than 2011, driven by new store development, supply chain investments and store systems. We expect free cash flow to be a minimum of $400 million, driven by areas such as increased net income and continued improvements to working capital, partially offset by higher capital expenditures. We anticipate the phasing of our quarterly operating profit will be somewhat different than our historical performance. We expect that our operating income growth will be the strongest during our first quarter and will be more constrained for the balance of fiscal 2012. This is driven by our first quarter comparisons versus the very weak start in fiscal 2011; the pacing and timing of our strategic investments in 2012, which are more focused in our second and third quarters; and the anniversary of expense savings from 2011, which started in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and accelerated throughout 2011. In closing, we remain focused on our 2 strategies of service leadership and superior availability and continuing to generate long-term growth, profits and shareholder value. Our strategic investments, relentless focus on service and operational excellence are key ingredients to achieving these. We want to thank our talented Team Members for the meaningful impacts they made in 2011 and look forward to an exciting 2012. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
167,GV_145977_2012Q4,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advance Auto Parts Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And today's call is being recorded. Before we begin, Joshua Moore, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations, will make a brief statement concerning forward-looking statements that will be made on this call. Joshua Moore Former Vice President of Finance & Investor Relations Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'd like to remind you that our comments today contain forward-looking statements. We intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the Safe Harbor Provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements address future events, developments or results and typically use words such as believe, anticipate, expect, intend, will, plan, forecast, outlook or estimate, and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause the results to differ materially, including competitive pressures, demand for the company's products, the economy in general, consumer debt levels, dependence on suppliers, the weather, business interruptions and other factors disclosed in the company's 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company intends these forward-looking statements to speak only as of the time of this conference call and does not undertake to update or revise them as more information becomes available. The reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with the corresponding GAAP measures are described in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at advanceautoparts.com. For planning purposes, our first quarter 2013 release is scheduled for May 23 before market open, and our quarterly conference call is scheduled for the morning of Thursday, May 23, 2013. To be notified of the date of future earnings reports, you can sign up through our Investor Relations section of our website. Finally, a replay of this call will be available on our website for 1 year. Now let me turn the call over to Darren Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Darren? Darren R. Jackson Former Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Joshua. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. The fourth quarter brought to a close a very challenging year, yet we reached several important strategic and operational milestones. Our achievements during 2012 are a direct result of the hard work and dedication of nearly 54,000 team members. I want to say thank you to our Advance team for their continued diligence and commitment. Our bottom line results in the fourth quarter were better than expected. That being said, we are never satisfied when comparable store sales and EPS decline. Our fourth quarter results reflected sequential improvement from last quarter in sales, gross margin rate, SG&A expense control and operating profits. As we had forecasted during the third quarter call, we anticipated that the market would be challenging, and demand would continue to be weak for the fourth quarter. Our focus was to build on the third quarter sales trajectory, while materially improving our operating results in the face of near-term decelerating trends of our industry. As a result of our efforts, our market share gains were greatest in the fourth quarter, while achieving a record high operating profitability. I'm encouraged that our comparable store sales sequentially gained 30 basis points in the quarter when adjusted for the holiday shift. Our improvement was driven by both commercial and our DIY business. Quarter-over-quarter improvement in market share was driven by commercial, with consistent comp-store sales growth in each period during our quarter when adjusted for the holiday shift in December for our Advance stores. Our Commercial Business had positive trends in both transactions and average ticket size. Our DIY comps sequentially improved from Q3 to Q4, driven by an increase in the average ticket size. The increase was driven by mix of products sold and better in-store customer engagement and staffing on the weekends. The uptick in overall average ticket was principally driven by the mix of products sold, namely the impact of failure category sales. Further impacting the average ticket growth has been the increasing cost of components driven by the ever increasing complexity of vehicles and the cycling of last year's escalating oil prices. From a geographical perspective, we continue to see weakness and volatility in our cold weather markets, especially in the Great Lakes and the Northeast regions. Our performance in those 2 markets continue to be impacted by the lingering effects of the unseasonably warm weather. These regions' comparable store sales continue to trail our total company average by several hundred basis points. However, we've seen our comparable store sales stabilize in these regions over the last 2 quarters, which is very encouraging as we enter 2013. Finally, we continue to pose low-single-digit comparable store sales growth in our western markets, where we only have 10% of our store base. As you recall, during our third quarter, we invested more heavily in the sales and service elements of our business in an effort to reignite demand and drive more customers through our doors, over our phones and onto our e-commerce website. Our investments in these areas improved our sales and market share results, but reduced our profitability in the third quarter. We expected our sales and service driving investments in the third quarter would carry over and benefit the balance of the year. The improved sales momentum, combined with our focus on improving our gross margin and cost management, resulted in higher profitability in the fourth quarter. Overall, the improvement in our operating profitability was modest, increasing to a record 8.5% for the quarter. More importantly, it sets the right focus and tone as we enter 2013 to leverage higher levels of profitability on modest sales gains. For the year, our operating income rate decreased 18 basis points to 10.6% of sales, and our earnings per share increased 2.2% to $5.22. Mike will provide more specific highlights of financial performance a little later in the call. As I reflect on 2012, we achieved some critical strategic and operational milestones. Strategically, we opportunistically entered the boroughs of New York through the acquisition of 21 former Strauss Auto Parts stores and 6 Steinway Auto Parts locations. Collectively, we opened 137 stores in 2012, which is the high watermark in the last 5 years. Importantly, it is our best performing class of new stores in nearly a decade. Our success in our 2012 new store performance positions us well as we expect to open nearly 200 stores in 2013. Competitively, it will close nearly a 300 basis point annual sales gap with some of our key competitors that has impacted our total and comparable store sales over the past several years. Strategically, our greatest accomplishment was the acquisition of BWP, which closed on December 31. Certainly, BWP helps solidify our position in the very large and competitive Northeast market. More importantly, the Stockel family and BWP team as a whole are extraordinary leaders in the commercial industry. We gained proven leadership, an outstanding team and first-class customer relationships that will provide a significant opportunity to learn and improve our Commercial Business in the short and long term. We are excited to welcome BWP to the Advance organization and confident that we have one of the most preeminent commercial players on our team. Operationally, our focus on related achievements were in execution fundamentals and completing industry- leading commercial capabilities. The commercial capabilities include the launch of our in-house commercial credit program; the opening of our new daily replenishment distribution center in Remington, Indiana; reaching double-digit penetration of our new B2B ordering platform; and continued hub store expansions. These milestones are significant steps, which will allow us to more effectively compete in the larger and faster growing commercial market. Our better execution of the fundamentals including improved delivery times, more effective weekend staffing and record-low shrink, which enabled record in-stock levels, will position us well heading into 2013. Turning to 2013, we are cautiously optimistic about our outlook. Our optimism is based on several external and industry factors. Obviously, it starts with a return to more normal weather patterns, which alone will provide much-needed strength for our business. The industry is expecting a gradual increase in the number of vehicles 7 years and older, coupled with a record level of deferred maintenance in 2013. Finally, gas prices, though very volatile, are forecasted to decline, which has historically provided nice tailwinds for the industry. Internally, our opportunity still lies within the fact that we have a very small commercial market share. The investment I mentioned earlier, along with our developing capabilities, such as our B2B e-commerce site and MotoLogic, our new diagnostic tool set, along with our rollout of a new electronic parts catalog to our stores later this year, will strengthen our ability to compete and allow us to continuously increase our commercial market share, while speeding up and improving the reliability and execution of our service at the shop and store level. Our guarded view is related to a couple key macrodevelopments that temper our optimism. First is the increase in the number of people purchasing or contemplating the purchase of a new vehicle. Undoubtedly, this will be good for us in the long term. However, it will cause short-term volatility in the industry as customers are more concerned about what they invest in maintaining their aging vehicle. Second, our economy continues to be lurching with high unemployment and wavering consumer confidence. The level of financial stress on our core customer will become more acute with the most recent payroll and other related tax increases that took effect at the start of the new year. The silver lining is that this is an economy of necessity, where consumers will continue to seek value from their local aftermarket garages or perform needed repairs and maintenance themselves. My final comment on the industry and customer outlook is whether we are at a structural inflection point or simply a cyclical moment. Clearly, I believe the long-term structural drivers of our industry remain very strong. Cyclically, consumers have a renewed interest in new vehicle purchases, home investment and other select big-ticket purchases. The weather cycle will even out over time. Structurally, parts proliferation, parts complexity, aging vehicle reliability and extended import part failure rates all underpin a fundamentally sound outlook for the industry. The roughly 250 million vehicles on the road today that are over 11 years old, like human beings, are lasting longer and requiring more care. In 2012, the industry may have caught a cold, which simply needs to run its course. Our recent 2013 regional leadership and sales team meetings conveyed one simple objective for the year, which is a company of one focused on fundamentals. The expected outcome is simple, which is to make the day in terms of our customer experience, sales and profitability. Pragmatically, that means we will stay the course on a few key initiatives that will drive our growth and improve our profitability including: One, growing our Commercial Business through improved levels of delivery speed and reliability, increased customer retention and share of wallet with our national and regional accounts; two, relentlessly improving our local market availability through hub expansions, tailoring and intensifying key store availability and leveraging our supply chain infrastructure; three, expanding our new store pipeline to grow at a run rate closer to 200 stores a year versus 100, while successfully capitalizing on our BWP acquisition; four, continuing our in-store execution excellence through scheduling effectiveness, on-hand accuracy, add-on sales training and customer engagement; five and finally, increasing our efficiency and effectiveness throughout the support areas and through a more integrated store operating model. Clearly, our company priorities have a more intense operations and execution bias than years past. Strategically, our agenda remains the same as years past. Operationally, our focus has moved from building key capabilities to driving results through outstanding execution. In closing, I'd like to share one example to illustrate the points I've been discussing. Partnership is key to commercial excellence. And since last February, our new commercial credit team has become a partner that more than half of our commercial customers rely on. Financial Services Director Bill Corey and his team provide our customers seamless personalized service with flexibility that meets their needs. Advance commercial credit is creating an improved customer credit experience, while helping our team better serve their customers. This team works closely with our customers from the minute they purchase from Advance to the time they are issued credit and receive statements. The feedback has been overwhelming. Our customers love talking to the same knowledgeable people and the program's simplicity, like getting credit within minutes instead of hours. Thanks, Bill, to you and your team for all you are doing to bring services our best part to life and drive excellence at Advance. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Freeland, our Chief Operating Officer. Kevin P. Freeland Former Chief Operating Officer Thanks, Darren, and good morning, and thanks to all of our team members. Even though 2012 was a challenging year, their efforts and milestones reached have made 2012 a pivotal year in our profitable growth journey. As I begin my prepared remarks, I'd like to go into a little more detail on these accomplishments and provide an update on our progress on the key priorities that support our superior availability strategy and new store growth. As I've mentioned on our previous calls, our focus with respect to superior availability is on providing our customers with the best-in-market availability and consistency of service, both in order accuracy and delivery speed. The areas of priority continue to be the expansion of our hub network, the continual upgrade of our parts inventory at our non-hub stores, the opening of our new DC and the implementation of our daily replenishment capability, the growth in new stores and the continued growth and rollout of our B2C and B2B e-commerce platforms, commercial diagnostic tool and our electronics part catalog. In our fourth quarter, we continued to expand our hub network through new store expansion and the upgrade of existing stores, which have the space and are strategically positioned to operate as a hub. As a result of this work, we added 11 additional hub stores, bringing our hub store count to 339 versus 294 at the end of 2011. We also upgraded the inventory at 211 non-hub stores during the quarter. Including our hub store conversions, we've upgraded the inventory to over 1/4 of our total store base. This was no small effort by our inventory and store teams, and this work positions us to provide the products our customers need when they need them. Our fourth quarter also marked our first full quarter where our Remington DC was fully operational. The opening of this new DC was critical on 2 fronts: One, it gives us much needed additional capacity as the result of our store growth over the past 5 years and will relieve a great deal of pressure on other DCs; two, Remington will be a model for us in the future in terms of automation, which we expect will greatly improve our productivity and efficiency and allow us to replenish our stores daily. We'll continue our rollout of shipments to stores within Remington's service area in phases, ultimately ramping up to over 400 stores this year. The initial rollout of daily replenishment has been going well, with all 195 stores receiving daily shipments at the end of 2012. Our initial results are promising as the potential to provide best-in- class availability is one of our top goals. Once this new DCs begin servicing its entire market, we expect it will begin to improve our supply chain costs and strengthen our gross profit rate. As a result of our store-level upgrades, the opening of Remington and a higher mix of parts inventory, our total inventory increased 13% to $2.3 billion. This increase is in line with our expectations and will position us well into 2013. We anticipate our total inventory will continue to grow in 2013 as we focus on increasing the overall breadth of our parts assortment, improving our position with larger commercial customers and integrating BWP. However, our growth in 2013 will likely be at a slower pace than 2012. That being said, we continue to work aggressively to free up capital to fund other parts of our business and improve our return on invested capital through our supply chain financing program. Our work in this area translates into expanding our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which increased roughly 700 basis points from 80.9% at the end of 2011 to 87.9% this year. Our own inventory decreased 28.5% or $111.2 million from $390 million to $278.8 million. Over the past year, we've been working aggressively to improve our e-commerce capabilities to better compete within our industry. To that end, we turned our efforts toward increasing the amount of our Commercial Business that's transacted online. We expect to continue to increase the B2B penetration rate over time. This will position our company to strengthen our relationship with larger and more national commercial garages, as well as improve both the frequency and retention rate of our existing commercial customers who utilize this capability. In April of last year, we had our full debut of MotoLogic, which we acquired in October of 2011. MotoLogic provides the best-in-class repair and diagnostic capabilities. We're still in the early stages of our rollout, but our initial customer response has been great. Our B2C site continues to make great progress, and we achieved new levels of performance. As I mentioned last quarter, we now have the #1 multichannel site in the markets we serve. Our B2C team ended the year with record sales and achieved $1 million in daily sales twice during the fourth quarter. This progress is fantastic and is only a glimpse of the possibilities our mobile and electronic capabilities can provide. Turning to our new store openings. We added 67 new stores, including 2 new Autopart International stores and Autopart International's acquisition of 6 former Steinway stores. This has been a record quarter for new store openings, and our teams have done an excellent job ensuring that the quality in which we open stores is at the highest standard. For the year, we added 137 new stores, including 21 Autopart International stores and closed 5. As of December 29, 2012, our total store count was 3,794 including 218 Autopart International stores. Our 2012 class of new stores continues to perform very well meeting our internal expectations of sales growth and overall sales productivity. As I mentioned last quarter, our 2012 class of stores is proving to be our most successful in terms of sales productivity, and the pace of their weekly sales ramp. As Darren discussed, we acquired BWP at the beginning of fiscal 2013. We're very excited about this affiliation, as BWP is one of the strongest commercial-only distributors within the markets they serve. This is a great opportunity for us to learn and integrate the best of Advance Auto Parts with the best of BWP and expand what they do to the rest of our commercial programs. On day 1, BWP will have a positive impact on our performance. We expect them to add $170 million to $180 million of sales to our business this year in incremental operating income dollars. We plan to integrate and convert the 124 BWP stores to our systems and branding over a 2- to 3-year period. We will continue to give you updates on any material developments as we work to convert these stores. As a result of this conversion process, we anticipate the net impact of the acquisition will be slightly dilutive to operating income for the year. Finally, I want to provide you a brief update on our progress to improve our gross profit rate. As you might recall, our goal after our second quarter 2012 results was to stabilize our sales trends, reverse our decelerating trends, while improving our overall gross profit rate. Through our efforts to better safeguard our inventory, maintain our disciplined approach in pricing, partnering more effectively with our suppliers and better managing our promotional activity, our gross profit rate increased 87 basis points to 49.9% versus 49.0% during the fourth quarter of 2011. For the year, our gross profit rate was 49.9%, which was up 19 basis points versus 2011. As we look ahead, we continue to see modest improvements in our gross profit rate for 2013 as we improve our product acquisition costs, generate increased supply chain efficiencies and continue to maintain our disciplined pricing strategy and shrink management. The improvements will be partially offset by the continued supply chain investments. Now let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Norona, to review our financial results in more detail. Michael A. Norona Former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members for their commitment to serving our customers as we navigated through a challenging fiscal 2012. I would also like to welcome our new BWP team members. I plan to cover the following topics with you this morning: One, provide some financial highlights from our fourth quarter of 2012; two, put our fourth quarter and year-to-date results into context with our expectations and key financial dimensions we use to measure our performance; and three, share with you our financial outlook for 2013. 2012 was a challenging year for our business in the markets in which we operate. Our fourth quarter performance and full year results were primarily driven by the ongoing softness in our colder-weather markets. In addition, our results were impacted by fluctuating gas prices, high unemployment and a tough economic environment with more uncertainty, which decreased consumer demand for auto parts. As Darren mentioned, our focus all year has been to influence the things that are in our direct control. And we continue to be focused on achieving our longer-term growth and profitability goals by maintaining our strategic focus, executing on the fundamentals and simplifying our operations. While we are disappointed we did not achieve our growth and profitability expectations, we are encouraged by our improved sales performance trends versus the market and generating positive operating income growth in our fourth quarter. This improvement translated into a fourth quarter sales increase of 0.1% to $1.3 billion, despite a comp store sales decrease of 1.9%. Adjusting for the impact of the calendar shift in Q4 where we lost a couple of selling days as Christmas fell on a Tuesday this year versus a Sunday last year, our comp store sales decreased roughly 1.5%. Offsetting our comp store sales decline was the net addition of 132 new stores over the past 12 months. Our total sales for fiscal 2012 increased 0.6% to $6.2 billion, and our comp store sales decreased 0.8%. Our fourth quarter gross profit rate increased 87 basis points to 49.9% versus 49% in Q4 of 2011. The increase was primarily driven by continued improvements in our shrink performance and supply chain efficiencies, driven by the increased volume of inventory handled during the quarter, partially offset by investments in our supply chain driven by the opening of Remington and increased new stores. For the year, our gross profit rate increased 19 basis points to 49.9%. Year-to-date, our commercial mix represented 38.1% of 2012 sales versus 37% in 2011. Our fourth quarter SG&A rate of 41.4% increased 79 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to the expense deleverage as a result of our 1.9% comp store sales decline, increased new store openings and costs associated with our acquisition-related activity during the quarter, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. For the year, our SG&A rate increased 36 basis points to 39.3% versus 39% over the same period last year. The increase in our SG&A is principally due to our fixed costs deleverage as a result of our 0.8% comp store sales decline. All in, our fourth quarter operating income dollars increased 1.1% to $113.2 million, and our operating income rate increased 9 basis points over the same period last year to 8.5%. This was on top of a 182 basis point improvement in fourth quarter 2011 over fourth quarter 2010. Our diluted earnings per share decreased $0.02 to $0.88 during the quarter versus $0.90 in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, our operating income dollars decreased 1.1% to $657.3 million, and our diluted EPS increased 2.2% to $5.22. Our average diluted share count was 74.1 million shares at the end of Q4. For the year, free cash flow was $412.3 million, down $94.9 million over the same period last year. The largest driver of the decrease in free cash flow was our planned increase of $89.9 million in our accounts receivable as a result of the in-sourcing of our commercial credit program. Our inventory increased 13% primarily in car parts categories driven by the opening of our Remington DC, our investments in hubs and store-level inventory upgrades, more new stores and to position the company for a strong availability in 2013. Our investments in inventory continue to be enabled by reductions in our owned inventory, which decreased $111 million compared to the end of 2011, and was driven by our continued efforts to increase our accounts payable to inventory ratio, which now stands at 87.9% versus 80.9% in Q4 of 2011. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $598.1 million in cash and $604.5 million of long-term debt on our balance sheet. Our adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio was 2.2x, which is well below our previously stated ceiling of 2.5x. We continue to measure our performance, the financial dimensions of growth, profit and value creation. Our approach in philosophy has always been to prioritize growth as our primary use of capital in order to increase returns and drive shareholder value. Our investments over the course of this year have been centered on accelerating our commercial growth and stabilizing our DIY business by improving our availability through our hub store openings, inventory upgrades, supply chain investments and strengthening our market position with increased new store openings. We are very proud that in our fourth quarter, we implemented our first wave of daily replenishment, entered the boroughs of New York and finalized our commercial credit in-sourcing. We are also excited about our acquisition of BWP, one of the leading commercial players in our industry. This acquisition closed at the beginning of 2013 fiscal year. While we prioritize growth as our #1 use of capital, share buybacks have always historically been a part of our capital allocation. We made the deliberate decision to slow our share buyback program in 2012 to preserve capital as we explored growth opportunities, including the acquisition of BWP. Looking ahead, we plan to continue our historical practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares in a disciplined manner in 2013 and beyond. Currently, we have roughly $492 million left under our share repurchase authorization at the end of Q4. Turning to profit. We remain committed to improving our profitability, which requires both delivering on our sales growth goals, primarily driven by commercial, and developing a more cost-competitive operating model. While we are not satisfied with the progress we made to our profit model in 2012, our plans in 2013 and beyond are focused on improving our profit model, which I will cover shortly in our annual outlook. As we look at value creation, we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital, which is reflected in our return on invested capital of 19.4%. ROIC decreased modestly from our fourth quarter last year, driven primarily by our planned increase in accounts receivable due to our commercial credit in- sourcing and lower operating income. Our AP ratio at the end of fourth quarter was a record 87.9%, and we remain focused on achieving an AP ratio of 100% over time. Turning to our outlook for 2013. Our performance will be driven by continued growth in our commercial sales, improved availability, increased new store openings, improved execution, modest improvement in gross profit rate and improvements in our cost structure. We expect the industry dynamics to remain favorable and anticipate to return to more normal weather patterns. These will be somewhat offset by continued volatility in the economic environment with more uncertainty impacting the consumer, such as increased taxes, relatively high unemployment and continued volatility in gas prices. As a result, we anticipate our comp store sales to grow low-single digits driven by stronger commercial comps. We plan to open 170 to 190 new stores and work to integrate the 124 BWP stores we acquired at the beginning of the fiscal year. We anticipate BWP to add approximately $170 million to $180 million of incremental sales in 2013. As a reminder, BWP will not be reflected in our comparable store sales calculation until fiscal 2014. We anticipate our gross profit rate to modestly improve, driven by merchandising capabilities and global sourcing, offset by competitive headwinds, the integration of BWP, which has a lower margin rate, and an increased mix in commercial sales. We anticipate our SG&A to deleverage, driven by increased new store growth, more normalized incentive compensation, the annualization of new stores from 2012 and approximately $0.15 to $0.20 of onetime integration costs for BWP. These costs will be somewhat offset by improved labor productivity, more effective marketing spend and improvements in our non-customer- facing support costs. All in, we anticipate our SG&A per store to increase 3% to 5%. We anticipate our quarterly operating profit for our first quarter of 2013 to decline mid to upper single digits given the current industry softness, tougher sales comparisons, the annualization of 2012 new stores along with the heavy concentration of stores opened in the fourth quarter of 2012 and higher incentive compensation. Turning to capital expenditures. We expect to invest approximately $275 million to $300 million, driven by new store development, supply chain investments and store systems. We expect free cash flow to be a minimum of $375 million, excluding the acquisition costs of BWP, which was approximately 1x BWP sales. Finally, we estimate our 2013 annual operating EPS outlook will be in the range of $5.45 to $5.60 per share, excluding onetime integration costs of BWP of approximately $0.15 to $0.20. On a reported basis including the BWP onetime integration costs, our EPS outlook is expected to be $5.30 to $5.45. This annual outlook reflects a weighted average share count of approximately 74 million outstanding diluted shares. Consistent with our historical practice, our outlook does not reflect any anticipated share repurchase activity. As we have previously shared, we plan to continue our historical practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares in a disciplined manner, which could possibly impact our 2013 annual EPS outlook. In closing, we are disappointed we did not deliver on the financial expectations in our fourth quarter and in 2012. We remain committed to improving our performance in achieving our longer-term growth and profitability goals by maintaining our strategic focus, investing in the key areas such as commercial and availability and executing on the fundamentals. We also have great confidence in our team's ability to improve our performance based on their talents, character and competitive spirit. Operator, we are now ready for questions."
168,GV_145042_2009Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to The Advisory Board Company's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Your host for the call today is Mr. Frank Williams, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. At this time, I will turn the call over to the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Frank Williams. Frank Williams Thank you and good evening. I am Frank Williams, Chairman and CEO of The Advisory Board Company, and I am joined tonight by Robert Musslewhite and Michael Kirschbaum. Let me start by giving you an overview of the agenda for this evening's call, which I have organized into three sections. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2008. I will cover both our financial results and an overview of the key drivers of our business performance. I will then turn it over to Michael, who will take us through a more detailed review of the financials. After that, Robert will comment on our strategic outlook for the remainder of this year, and then we will be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended June 30, 2008, The Advisory Board revenues were $57.2 million or 12% growth over the comparable quarter of the prior year. Net income was $6.3 million compared with $7.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, and earnings per diluted share were $0.36 versus $0.38 in the same period a year ago. Contract value grew 10.3% to $232.3 million as of June 30, 2008, up from $210.6 million as of June 30, 2007. This quarter, we continued to see very strong renewal performance across the board, as well as significant attachment to our agendas and high utilization of program services. A number of our program and service innovations are also starting to take hold as we are hearing numerous economic impact stories from our Expert Resource Center, as well as from utilization of our data benchmarking services and implementation toolkits. In general, The Advisory Board brand and reputation continue to grow in the industry, as the breadth and depth of our knowledge base and associated services drive meaningful performance improvement across the membership. At the same time, however, we did see the effects of the tougher macroeconomic environment in our new business performance with conversion rates declining across the quarter and deceleration in contract value growth. While we would typically expect to have roughly 60% of our first half-year new business coming in during the last half of May and the month of June, we did not end the quarter as well as we would have liked. Despite robust pipelines and strong interest in individual prospect institutions, many expected decisions ultimately didn't come through within the quarter. In total, we ended the quarter several million dollars behind our target objective with a number of decisions pushing out to later this year. This shortfall occurred primarily in our higher price point memberships, particularly in our implementation support and analytical tools based programs. The health system is facing a more uncertain financial outlook as they begin to enter their 2009 budget cycles, the larger dollar expenditures seem to be receiving greater scrutiny despite the strong value propositions in each of these programs. As I mentioned on the last call, we had experienced a slight decline in growth from cross-sell which had come in below the mid point of our expected range in the March quarter; however, in the June quarter we saw a much larger impact of the slowing economy, as members weighed the impact of increasing economic pressure on forward budgets. The impact of the under performance on new business in May and June, as well as, a more conservative outlook for new business in the second half of the year, particularly in the September quarter, translates to a reduction of roughly $6 to $8 million in second half accrual revenues versus our original expectations. The second factor influencing our outlook for the second half is related to increasing operational complexity in two of our analytical tools programs which I described on the last call. We have made some progress in working through a large bolus of new members; however, we are still seeing some delayed start dates and extended membership terms particularly in our nursing and bad debt programs. As a result, we are expecting roughly $1 to $2 million less in calendar year 2008 revenues than we would have originally anticipated. Given the more challenging business environment and the extended implementation timelines in our analytical tools programs, we feel more comfortable with a range of $232 to $237 million for calendar year 2008 revenues. Michael will discuss our revised guidance in a little more detail, but we feel like we have good visibility into both revenue and the cost side, and have taken into account the tougher spending environment in developing our targets for the remainder of this year. We began 2008 with a relatively stable outlook in a tougher economy. Unfortunately, we have not been able to mute the effects on the new business side as economic conditions have dampened their perspective on 2009 financial performance for a number of our members. Accordingly, our current game plan, which we put in place over the last 30 days, focuses on driving strong sales execution, enhancing our program value propositions, and leveraging thoughtful investments in new product development to set up our forward growth objectives. Let me describe each of these initiatives in turn. In times where we have seen a more difficult spending environment, nothing is more important than strong sales execution. Having the right sales talent in seat is, of course, one of the primary drivers of improved performance and fortunately, we are in a strong position here as we enter the second half of the year. Over the last several months, we have been focused on maintaining strong recruiting pipelines and moving aggressively to bring new talent into the sales force. We are currently fully staffed on both the new business and account management teams and have structured our recruiting team to be directly accountable for identifying star talent while keeping open positions to a minimum. We are also putting major resources behind onboarding and training efforts to ensure that our new sales teams are highly productive, and road ready within the first 60 to 90 days. As a senior team, we have been marshalling our sales teams for strong performance, the top priority for leaders across the firm. We have implemented a whirlwind like approach that extends beyond the sales organization and involves critical individuals from all disciplines, research, member service, product delivery, et cetera, in supporting our sales efforts. Mandatory meetings, multiple times per week focus this group and create urgency as we put the best minds in the firm behind our efforts. This multi-disciplinary team is contributing in a variety of capacities including honing our message to key segments, enhancing our infrastructure for a more customized sales presentation based on specific member issues, enriching training for sales teams and refining talent allocation strategies to ensure that top talent is deployed against the best opportunities. The energy that this group is bringing to the sales effort is impressive, and is absolutely the right answer to ensure that we execute at a high standard for the remainder of the year. From a program perspective, we are working hard to deliver cutting-edge end sites and tools to our members to drive financial impact and to ultimately set up cross-sell of additional programs. As always, our unparalleled relationships with more than 2700 members are a critical asset that guides our work in this regard. Not more than ever, we are investing in heavy member contract to get continual feedback to ensure that our agendas are on point and that we understand members up at night issues. Across the summer and fall, we have ample opportunity to get comprehensive feedback as many of our programs run their national meeting series at this time. A highlight is always our CEO round table series across the summer and fall with approximately 700 of the nation's top health systems CEOs joining us for facilitated research presentations and candid discussions of their most strategic and operational issues. As always, we are using that feedback to develop innovative program services to address our members' most important issues and to center our service offerings on driving clear financial impact in a tougher economic climate. Finally, of course we continue our ongoing focus on robust new product development. As we discussed in our last call, we have a number of exciting initiatives under way in this terrain and we continue to prioritize their development. Our new work in the education terrain has presented some interesting opportunities, and we are also excited about leveraging our deep knowledge of providers and physicians along with our expanding data asset to develop new offerings targeted at other sectors within healthcare. In that regard, I am very pleased to announce our newest program launch, the decision management performance program. Rooted in research feedback from member Chief Medical Officers, this new membership enhances hospital's ability to improve quality and cost metrics by providing hospitals with unprecedented access to data and best practices on physician performance. In national surveys, nearly 90% of hospital administrators indicate that physicians are a critical driver of hospital performance on key costs and quality metrics, highlighting the importance of engaging this constituency in outcomes improvement. Growing trends towards transparency and pay for performance make it all the more critical that hospitals align physicians beyond hospital goals. Across our membership, chief medical officers consistently describe the inadequacy of current processes in effectively managing clinical costs and quality and have identified a need for a robust, comprehensive set of tools and best practices to achieve superior physician management performance. The physician management program creates a membership of chief medical officers working together to identify best practices and key metrics critical in the quest to engage physicians in order to meaningfully impact critical quality and cost indicators. This renewable membership program is anchored by a robust web-based tool that leverages technology from Crimson to extract irrelevant data from underlying systems, assimilate the data into an actionable format and identify performance improvement opportunities from these metrics on a real-time basis. The data then becomes the platform for best practices and physician management, enhancing each member's institutions ability to measure performance, instill accountability and develop effective incentive structures across a diverse medical staff infrastructure. As always, this launch has had a great set of charter members including BJC Healthcare, Fairview Hospital, Covenant Medical Center, Clinical Health System and Huntsville Memorial Hospital. With this group of charter members, we have the opportunity to build a strong membership and a vibrant network of leading health systems focused on enhancing physician alignment to achieve critical objectives. The Physician Management Performance Program brings our total number of Senior Executive membership programs to 38. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to provide an update on our organization. We continue to scale our direct sales force in line with our plans for the year with 111 teams currently in place, up from 95 at this time last year. Total Advisory Board headcount now stands at more than 960 people and our research staff is now more than 550 strong. We are having great success in recruiting top talent, as we continue to see rich, high-quality pipelines for each job opening, as well as, exceptional new offer acceptance rates. Our career staff retention rate continues to be in line with our past experience, in the high 80s. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail and then Robert to discuss his priorities across the next few quarters. Michael Kirschbaum Thanks, Frank. I have organized today's financial review around five categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2008. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we are on a March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 12% to $57. 2 million, up from $51.1 million in the same period last year. Income from operations, net income and earnings per diluted share were $8.3 million, $6.3 million and $0.36 respectively for the quarter ending June 30, 2008, compared to $9.1 million, $7.1 million and $0.38 respectively for the same quarter last year. Cost of services increased to 49.9% of revenue compared to 47.5% of revenue in the same period of the prior year. The increase in percentage is largely a result of additional costs from our Crimson acquisition, as well as, increased consultant and licensing fees associated with some of our newer analytic tool programs. Member relations and marketing expense was 21.7% of revenue, compared to 20.8% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in expense is attributable mainly to our continued investment in expanding our number of sales teams. We currently have a 111 sales teams in place compared to 95 in June of 2007. G&A expense in the quarter decreased to 12.1% of revenue compared to 12.4% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year, due to the scaling of our administrative cost over a larger revenue base. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter increased to 1.9% of revenue compared to 1.5% of revenue the same quarter the prior year. The increase is primarily from the amortization of capitalized cost related to the development of analytic tools from some of our newer programs, as well as, the amortization of intangibles from the Crimson acquisition. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable, which exclude long-term receivables increased to $98.1 million as of June 30, 2007, versus $67.6 million as of June 30, 2007. DSO, which we calculate using average receivables were 143 days in the quarter ended June 2008, up from 137 days last quarter, and up from 112 days in June 2007. Excluding receivables associated with revenue from multi-year contracts that will be recognized beyond 12 months, and excluding receivables acquired from Crimson, DSOs were 119 days in the quarter ended June 30, 2008 compared to 107 in the prior year. The increase in DSOs due to continued increase of the mix towards a higher price point programs, which includes more product selling. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we have billed after 12 months, increased 25.7% to $150.5 million as of June 30, 2008, up from $119.7 million as of June 30, 2007. Excluding prepaid contracts and long- term deferred, deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2008 was $132 million, up 16.6 % over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ended June 30, 2008, we generated $92,000 of cash from operating activities compared to $183,000 used in the same quarter last year. For fiscal 2009, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be approximately 1.5 to two times net income for the full fiscal year. Capital Expenditures for the three months ending June 30, 2008 were approximately $5.8 million of which $3.6 of million is related to capitalized development of hardware associated with analytic tools associated with some of our newer programs and $1.6 million related to the build-out of a new headquarters. Fiscal year 2009, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $12 to $15 million. For the three months ended June 30, 2008, we repurchased $8.8 million of stock or approximately 108,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase to date to $251.4 million or approximately 5.3 million shares. As of June 30, 2008, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $98.6 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2008, we spent approximately $19 million in cash from the acquisition of Crimson, provider of data and analytic tools to hospitals, health systems and physician clinics. As of June 30, 2008 our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $114.9 million. As the contract value, contract value increased 10.3% to $232.3 million as of June 30, 2008, up from $210.6 million as of June 30, 2007. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time, without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts more than 12-months duration, we may include only 12 months of contract value. Now, with respect to the remainder of calendar year 2008, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor Provisions outlined in the beginning of the call, and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar year 2008, based on factors that Frank mentioned earlier we are revising our full-year revenue guidance to range from approximately from $232 million to $237 million. With a change in revenue guidance, we are also updating our earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of approximately $1.50 to $1.57 for the full calendar year 2008. Included in this calendar year 2008, earnings per diluted share was approximately $0.47 to $0.49 of share based compensation related expense and approximately $0.10 from the acquisition of Crimson. For the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, we expect an effective income tax rate of approximately 32.3%. For the quarter ending September 30, 2008, we expect revenue of approximately $57.5 million to $59 million, and earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.30 to $0.33. This concludes the financial summary. I will now turn things over to Robert. Robert Musslewhite Thanks, Michael. As Frank emphasized, our clear focus is on driving member value and strong renewal performance, enhancing conversion rates through sales force execution, and improved program merchandising, and introducing strong new product launches which set up the business for the long term. While we have a lot of work to do to respond rapidly and effectively, we remain optimistic about our ability to get back on track for a few important reasons. First of all, as Frank discussed in detail, we have an aggressive plan in place for enhancing sales strategy and execution. The entire leadership team across the organization is engaged and accountable in this effort and the energy and drive I see them bringing to bear should have an impact on performance over the coming months assuming the overall economy trends in a positive direction. The second reason for optimism is our confidence in our new product development strategy and our ability to continue to expand and diversify our addressable market. We remain convinced that our analytical tools programs address an extremely important need for improved data and transparency in the hospital industry, and open up a significant market opportunity where we can have a leadership position. Because of the high ROI associated with these programs, we believe that by more directly merchandising early member success stories, and demonstrated financial impact, we can overcome some of the budget conservatism in the current economic climate. Furthermore, our recent success internationally and in launching a new vertical in education opens up a number of high growth markets which have the opportunity to be significant contributors to our future growth. The fact that we are still less than 12% penetrated in our $2 billion current cross-sell opportunity should allow us with strong execution to drive a successful long-term growth plan. Third, I have confidence in our ability to execute at a very high standard in a tougher economic climate. We have an extremely strong leadership team in place with our tenure across our top 100 managers approaching 10 years on average. This group has managed at a high standard in the face of a number of difficult economic headwinds in the past, and therefore has a proven game plan for getting the business back on track. Furthermore, in a favorable labor market, we have continued to attract strong talent into the organization across the board. While there are a number of factors that will influence our ultimate performance, I am convinced that we have the right level of focus, accountability and proven experience across the organization to ensure that we are executing at a very high standard. My fourth reason for optimism involves our members. While our members are behaving more cautiously in the current environment, we have not seen a major focus on cost reduction in our member surveys and members do not appear to be in crisis mode from a budget perspective. Although new sales have been impacted by the microeconomic climate, at the same time we have seen strong member attachment to our programs and very good renewal rate performance. In that light, we remain hopeful that some good news on the macroeconomic front will lead to some positive changes in the spending environment for advisory board programs. Overall, as I consider where we are today, I feel good about the fundamentals of the underlying business, and where we are headed from a strategic perspective. In the near term, the dynamics are obviously more difficult when we are facing the headwinds of a tighter spending environment, but we believe the right course is to redouble our efforts on the strategies that have served us well in the past. On that front, we have a comprehensive plan in place and throughout the organization the team is demonstrating incredible drive, dedication and energy. Our unwavering focus on execution should allow us to continue to strengthen our member relationships, expand the business, and enhance our impact on the industries we serve. With that, let me turn it back over to Frank. Frank Williams Thanks, Robert. I believe that concludes the formal part of the call and we appreciate everyone participating and why don't we take the time now to answer your questions."
169,GV_145042_2010Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advisory Board Company's first quarter earnings conference call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Your host for the call today is Mr. Robert Musslewhite, Chief Executive Officer and Director of The Advisory Board Company.

For additional information on the company's results and outlook, please refer to its first fiscal quarter news release. The company undertakes no obligations to update any forward- looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Please proceed. Robert Musslewhite Thank you, good evening. I am Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, covering our financial results as well as the broader market environment. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our key operational and strategic priorities. As always, we will be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended June 30, 2009, Advisory Board revenues were 56.7 million compared to 57.2 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Net income was 4.2 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to 6.3 million or $0.36 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. EBITDA excluding foreign currency gain was 7.3 million for the quarter compared to 9.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Contract value as of June 30, 2009 stood at $232.8 million versus $232.3 million as of June 30, 2008. Our overall performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations. Despite the challenging economic climate, our contracts values remain steady year over year and increased sequentially, illustrating our ability to address our members' most critical issues through programs that deliver tangible value. While the ongoing budget pressures that our members are experiencing continued to impact our performance, our action plan for the year has put us in a solid position to weather these times with stability and to position for growth as the climate improves. The broader environment continues to feel similar to that of the last several quarters with members scrutinizing every dollar that they spend and demanding clear, measurable and your near term returns on their investment in memberships with us. As we have indicated in prior quarters, this dynamic is impacting our results in both new sales and renewals. However as we have discussed, there are some differences across our programs as to the degree of impact. For example, as we expected, our renewal discussions for our workforce, nursing, and philanthropy oriented research membership programs and our leadership development programs have been more challenging this year. While our teams leading these programs have done an excellent job of documenting the impact they have had on each of our membership organizations, there are still members who feel that they must delay renewal decisions or even take a year off from membership due to extreme financial constraints or the overall spending environment at their institutions. Where this happens, the message is almost universally positive in terms of the incredible value the members are receiving from these programs. However, we do here more of them saying, I would love to continue my membership, your research has an important enormous impact on our organization. However, we are cutting all discretionary expenses right now, so I have to take some time off and we would like to talk again later in the year. In contrast, many of our programs anchored by analytical tools have fared better in terms of renewals as we have begun to see how the inherent stickiness of these tools and their delivery of clear, tangible ROI resulted in strong number attachment. The integration of these tools into daily workforce means that they are less often considered discretionary and members having invested both dollars and internal resources in implementing the tools generally are reluctant to consider taking a year off. The strong renewal profile is one reason along with the large new market, the potential for dramatic member impact and the scalable economics that we have been so excited about our newer analytical tools programs. In terms of new sales, the environment this past quarter remained challenging as we expected and programs not directly tied to margin improvement continued to lag. We were however encouraged to see some early results of our investments in the sales and marketing organization and our focus on launching new programs with clear financial returns as we were able to achieve greater traction in the market with these high-priority offerings. Despite tight budgets, members have been willing to budget for and spend on solutions in areas of urgency that offer proof of tangible margin improvement and we have benefited where our programs and tools meet these needs. Looking ahead, our members continue to cope with economic pressures and questions are on pending reforms. However, as we move towards the September to December time frame, which is our biggest sales of renewals period of the year, we are hopeful that we will be able to continue and build on the pockets of momentum we have seen in some areas this past quarter and we are allocating more sales and marketing resources to these areas to take advantage of the opportunities. We have also redoubled our efforts at ensuring that we are consistently delivering on point research agendas, proven best practices, and measurable impact for our members. One priority issue that has taken center stage in that endeavor has been healthcare reform. As our members wrestle with this rapidly changing and difficult set of issues, they turn to us to distill the larger implications of reform into meaningful imperatives for superior performance in the coming years. Of course, this topic has been the top of our agenda since president Obama's inauguration and it now headlines our largest and most important member meetings as well as warrant significant proactive communication with the membership through teleconferences, special red alerts and publications. While the specific details of delivery system and financing reform proposals are yet to be finalized, many common themes exist across all proposals on the table. As such, we have developed a framework of ten critical implications that are and will be relevant in almost any scenario that results from the Congressional debates. For each of the implications within this framework, we provide a full complement of key resources to help members develop the strategy that will best position them for future success as the policy landscape coming months and years. As we anticipate the changes likely to come from healthcare reform, one concept garnering significant attention from our members is the prospect of bundle payments. While legislative negotiations continue, the longer-term direction of payment reform is relatively clear. Providers will be held increasingly accountable for the overall quality and cost of care provided to their patients. Policymakers seeking to break down silos and barriers to collaboration across the continuum of care are likely to require all of the patient providers to collectively share a single bundled payment for that patient's care. Under this structure, hospitals and health systems must rethink the composition, structure, and contractual underpinnings of their medical staff and the ways in which they collaborate with their physicians. As they do so, the top resources to which they turn are on our existing publications on best practices in physician alignment and our newest research on going through the summer on breakthrough physician integration, which profiles emerging models for managing the shared accountability and shared risk that are likely to emerge from the reform discussions. Over the years, members have consistently reported that our guidance has been critical to the development of the best physician alignment strategy for their institutions. Without fail, they also tell us that our best practices and structuring these relationships and our library of actionable resources, identify physician recruitment workflows, specialist employment matrices, and practice management tool kits, have been critical to the successful implementation of their chosen approach. Our track records of helping members work more closely with physicians is evident across our product portfolio and the tangible results that these effects produce further reinforce our position as the trusted advisor on this set of issues. For example, our physician management performance program, which is, anchored around the Crimson business intelligence platform for hardwiring the improvements of physician clinical performance has garnered many outstanding stories of financial returns. For example, through just six months of program membership, one hospital was able to streamline care processes for high length of stay diagnosis, saving $800,000. Another hospital used the tool to improve its core measure of compliance to the 90th percent term nationally, earning $500,000 in pay per performance incentives in its first year of membership. A nine facility system achieved over $3.5 million in savings by reducing care variation across its sites through the program. And a vertically integrated health system used the tools to reign in physician cost outliers for over $5.5 million in savings. Standalone hospital or large health systems, all types of organization can and do benefit from better visibility into physician performance and are best practices for leveraging that data to influence physician behavior. One CEO of a member institution is so enthusiastic about the program that he told us ""If I had the ear of the president, I would tell him that we need two things, a national fishing holiday in Crimson. Your physician management program provides with strategic pillars for moving an organization forward."" Prospects for national fishing holiday aside, whatever the end results of today's policy level discussions, these types of performance improvement are certain to stand our members in good stead. The institutions that have in place effective models for physician collaboration and powerful data-driven insights to inform physician behavior are going to be winners in tomorrow's healthcare system. It is gratifying to see that across our membership programs, our research, insights and tools are positioning our members for superior performance over the coming years. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to provide an update on several of our recent product launches. Our revenue integrity performance program is off to a great start and is garnering increased attention in the marketplace given the impending commencement in August of the government's Medicare payment audits through recovery audit contractors or RACs. In preparation for the start of these audits, we held a very successful teleconference recently, profiling two of our outlook cohort members and their development of the best practice workflow to handle the many complex demands of the RAC audit. Our initial members are well positioned to respond to the audit and stand to avoid millions of dollars in potential repayments. The program has added some great institutions to our membership process, including Charleston Area Medical Center, Jackson Memorial Hospital, East Orange General Hospital, and Methodist Medical Center of Illinois. Our university business executive program too is continuing to build momentum. Having closed our inaugural meeting series this spring to a strong 3.7 GPA, we are now in the process of preparing for the fall meeting series, which will focus on the timely imperative of managing and reducing costs in several key areas. Our growing cohort of outstanding university business executives, including recent joins from such institutions as Texas A&M, Bucknell, Oklahoma State and the American University will ensure that our upcoming meeting discussions are as lively, interactive and informative as the last round. Finally as I mentioned earlier, our physician management performance program is proving to have significant impact for our participating members. Our many case studies have demonstrated ROI make way for very compelling story to the market and as a result this has been one of the strongest launches in our history. In addition, with rapid average implementation times, the program allows members to begin receiving value extremely quickly, further reinforcing the purchase decision and members' willingness to recommend the membership, with over 90% of members reporting in QA calls that they will recommend the program to their peers. The accomplishments of our recent launches stand as a testament to our outstanding new product development process. Our NPD pipeline is very robust and we're excited about the compelling products we have in progress for launches later this year and into 2010. A heavily member driven process we employer focuses on solutions in an era of urgency that offer proof of tangible financial returns and based on our intensive testing process and our early member collaboration, we anticipate continued success of the upcoming new program launches. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael Kirshbaum Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around five categories, income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2009. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we are on a March 31 fiscal year-end, which means we just finished the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. For the quarter just ended, revenue was 56.7 million compared to 57.2 million the same period last year. EBITDA excluding foreign currency gains, net income and earnings per diluted share were 7.3 million, 4.2 million and $0.27 respectively for the quarter ending June 30, 2009 compared to 9.4 million, 6.3 million and $0.36 respectively for the same quarter last year. Reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA can be found in our press release. For the quarter, cost of services increased to $30.1 million or 53% of revenue compared to 28.6 million or 49.9% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in cost of services is primarily due to the increased cost associated with newer programs launched in previous quarters as well as increased investment associated with some of our analytical tools programs as discussed in previous calls. Member relations and marketing expenses was $12.6 million or 22.1% of revenue compared to $12.4 million or 21.7% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. Currently, we have 111 sales teams in place compared to 111 in June 2008. G&A expenses in the quarter decreased to $6.8 million or 11.9% of revenue compared to $6.9 million or 12.1% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. Depreciation and amortization expenses in the quarter increased to $1.9 million or 3.4% of revenue compared to $1.1 million or 1.9% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase was primarily from the amortization of capitalized costs related to the development of analytical tools and some of our newer programs as well as amortization of intangible assets from the Crimson acquisition. Other expense net in the quarter was $1 million. This amount consists of interest income of $600,000 and a gain of $400,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable which excludes long term receivables increased $124.6 million as of June 30, 2009 versus $98.1 million as of June 30, 2008. DSOs which we calculate using average receivables was 191 in the quarter ended June 30, 2009 up from 143 days as of June 2008 and down from 196 days as of March 2009. Year-over-year increase in DSOs is due to continued increased mix towards our higher placement programs which includes more progress billings. Excluding the effect of progress payments, DSOs on bill day are 45 days as of June 30, 2009, similar to the same metric in June 2008, which was 43 days. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we billed up to 12 months increased 13.6% to 171 million as of June 30, 2009, up from 150.5 million as of June 30, 2008. The increase in deferred revenue is due mainly to higher proportion of multiyear contracts. Excluding prepaid contracts and long-term deferred, the deferred revenue balance for June 30, 2009 was 149.8 million up 13.5% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ended June 30, 2009, we received $2.6 million of cash from operating activities compared to 93,000 provided from operating activities in the same quarter last year. The first quarter of our fiscal year typically provides the lowest quarterly cash flow from operations. For fiscal year 2010, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be approximately 1.5 to two times net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $700,000 compared to $5.9 million in total capital expenditures for the three months ending June 30, 2008. This decrease is due to the buildup expense for our DC headquarters last year as well as reduced levels of capital expenditures associated with our analytic tools program this year when compared to the same period of the prior year. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures was $3.4 million used in the quarter ending June 30, 2009 compared to $5.6 million used in the same quarter of the previous year. For the three months ended June 30, 2009, we repurchased $900,000 of stock or approximately 35,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $304.9 million or approximately 7.2 million shares. As of June 30, 2009, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $45.1 million. As of June 30, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $83.2 million. As to contract value, contract value increased 0.2% to 232.8 million as of June 30, 2009 from 232.3 million as of June 30, 2008. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or the remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts of more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. With respect to the remainder of calendar year 2009, the following comments are intended to fall under the safe harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. As previously announced, calendar 2009 revenues are expected to be within a few percentage points of calendar 2008 revenue. We expect EBITDA in the range of approximately $27 million to $35 million and earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.90 to $1.20. Each of the deferrals and marketing and new property expenses from the June quarter until late in the year, we expect expense for the calendar year to be back weighted. This concludes the financial summary. I will now turn things back over to Robert. Robert Musslewhite Thanks, Michael. I want to close with a brief update on our progress against several key elements of our action plan for the year. First, we remain intently focused on value delivery to members. Within our existing programs, this focus is manifested in a relentless drive for superior service, product innovation, and research excellence. Member feedback through all channels including member surveys, QA calls, performance improvement tracking and impromptu communications, indicates that our work is paying dividends, both in members recognition of program value, and in the measurable returns that our work is producing through enhanced member performance. Second, sales and marketing execution has been and continues to be another of our top priorities and we are pleased that we have began to see some early results from our investments in this area. With a 111 sales teams and seats, we have made significant innovations in the process for modifying our sales collateral quickly to focus on the hottest, highest ROI areas, and these messages are resonating well with the market. To complement these efforts, we are currently looking at leveraging our account management organization in creative ways to expand this more cost-effective channel for selling some of our still valuable but less hot products. Finally, new techniques and campaigns are effectively generating inbound interest from the membership, which we are rapidly converting into new sales. Third, our cost management efforts continue to garner our attention and support from all members of our staff, from management down to the frontline. Having restructured program operations in a number of years earlier in the year, we are now seeing enhanced efficiency throughout the organization, which now stands at just under a thousand people. We continue to scrutinize each additional expenditure and new resource decisions as well as search for additional efficiencies across the firm and are gratified with the ongoing focus on improved cost performance that we see across the entire organization. Overall, throughout the firm, everyone is working with commitment and engagement to execute at an A+ standard on all fronts to maintain stability this year and position us for a successful 2010. Our hard work, expertise and passion that our employees exhibit each day is energizing, and along with our strong business model, exceptional member relationships and track record of impact, it gives me tremendous confidence in our future prospects. That completes the formal part of the call. I'll now be happy to take your questions."

Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you. Good evening. I'm Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, covering our financial results, as well as a discussion on some of the key drivers of our performance. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our key operational and strategic priorities. As always, we will be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended June 30, 2010, Advisory Board revenues increased 17.6% to $66.7 million from $56.7 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Net income was $4.6 million or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $4.2 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. EBITDA was $9.5 million for the quarter compared to $7.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Contract value increased 17.8% to $274.4 million as of June 30, 2010, up from $232.8 million as of June 30, 2009. It was another solid quarter for us as we were able to sustain the momentum from our strong start to the calendar year and continue to see payoff from the investment strategy we pursued last year. While our members face a unique period of tremendous change and uncertainty, they are attaching more than ever to our agendas, tools and services, and we continue to deliver strong and measurable bottom line impact to them through our work. As a result, for the June quarter, member renewals remained strong and new sales came in ahead of expectations, giving us visibility into robust revenue performance for the rest of the calendar year. We are gratified that we continue to sustain our position as trusted advisor and leading service provider to the health care industry, and that we are consistently able to deliver meaningful impact on our members' most critical and most complex problems. One such problem where we are developing new capabilities to serve our members is in the area of health care IT. Across the membership, executives report that at the top of their strategic agendas is the issue of developing an IT strategy and infrastructure that will enable them to successfully navigate the increasing burdens of technology performance and reporting requirements. Let me put this issue in context. Facing the daunting financial challenges from the aging of the baby boomers and recently passed coverage expansion, policymakers continue their effort to establish a framework to fundamentally reshape health care financing and delivery, shifting the reimbursement system away from traditional fee-for-service payment toward a more risk-based approach. The objective is to create incentives for health care providers to become more coordinated, more integrated, more reliable, lower cost and more focused on treating chronic disease in a sustainable way. Critical to this vision is a highly functioning IT infrastructure, comprised of such elements as electronic medical records, computerized physician order entry, health information exchanges and sophisticated data analytics. These components, which enable tighter adherence to evidence-based guidelines, more rigorous collection of and management against performance metrics and better transparency and exchange of patient data across the care continuum, will form the foundation of the effective health care organization of the future. Across the country, hospitals and health systems have made building this foundation a top priority. Yet the path towards that vision is fraught with challenge. The implementation of any one of these technologies is expensive and complex, requiring comprehensive workflow knowledge, executive and clinician support and significant change management across the organization. The health care IT terrain is further complicated by a series of regulatory mandates that will have significant impact over the next several years. These include the burden of proving meaningful use of electronic health records by 2011 in order to qualify for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act; the required compliance in 2012 with the new version 5010 of the EDI standards under HIPAA; the conversion in 2013 to a new coding schema, the ICD-10; and finally, the phase-in of additional meaningful use requirements in 2013 and 2015. For help understanding the imperatives and ensuring that they take optimal steps to meet them, our members are turning to us more than ever for critical health in the IT area, and we are enhancing our capabilities to drive multiple sources of value to our members here. First, given the importance of IT issues at this time, we have invested senior leadership effort in sharpening the vision and agenda of our long-standing IT strategy program. With a new, more explicit focus on serving as the critical link between the CIO and the rest of the executive suite, the IT strategy program's goal is to provide the best practices, research and tools to align IT strategy with the broader health system goals. The need for a thoughtful, nimble and forward-looking IT strategy has never been greater. And our IT strategy program has been executing at an extremely high standard on a robust agenda to help members meet these challenges. For example, on July 13, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the much- awaited final rule defining the term meaningful use of electronic health records, a requirement that hospitals must meet in order to qualify for the Medicare and Medicaid incentives associated with adopting health IT. Given the burden that IT investments place on organizations' budgets, these incentives are financially significant for hospitals. As a result, being prepared for the meaningful use requirements has become a critical priority for many hospitals and health systems. In order to support our members in meeting this goal, we have tracked the regulatory process closely for the last 18 months, with our expert staff attending critical hearings on the Hill, reporting to our members real-time on key developments and providing deeper analysis of legislation. Upon this month's release of the final rule, we already had a strong bench of experts on the topic, as well as a broad set of resources prepared to assist members. These include most notably, a detailed 30-page analysis of the implications of the final rule, which we published immediately following the rule's release; a series of meaningful use web conferences to allow members to interact directly with our IT experts on this topic; and the EHR Meaningful Use Diagnostic tool, an online tool which assesses eligible hospitals' progress towards achieving meaningful use of EHR technologies, and helps users identify the health IT functionalities that should be prioritized during implementation to maximize incentive payments. The feedback that we have received from our members about these resources has been very strong, and we are pleased to offer IT strategy program members similar depth in other such key topics as preparing IT for accountable care, developing an electronic medical record strategy, elevating care quality through IT and leveraging data for performance improvement. Our work in these areas has proven to be highly impactful as our members align strategy, set course and drive broad performance improvement from their IT initiatives. Second, to complement the strategic level support of our IT strategy program, I'm pleased to announce today the launch of our Applications and Technologies Collaborative. This renewable research membership program provides the CIO and the professional IT staff a more detailed level of research on emerging and disruptive technologies, delivering the information required to choose and implement these technologies to achieve health system goals while minimizing risk. Through our team of experts and analysts, the Applications and Technologies Collaborative provides guidance on how to work with IT vendors to achieve necessary capabilities, along with ongoing coverage of such evergreen areas as EMR and CPOE adoption, clinical decision support systems and data interoperability. Our IT practice leadership team has been instrumental in the development of the program, which offers a mix of syndicated research content, as well as customized support and interactive consultation based on the member's specific information technology environment. As always, member value is enhanced by the network of IT executives and professionals convened by our work and the facilitated interactions we provide, including peer-to-peer networking, user groups and regular member meetings. Member reaction has been extremely positive thus far, with many of the industry's leading lights signing on as charter members, including Rush University Medical Center, University of Maryland Medical Center, Banner Health, Scripps Health and University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Because this model delivers the information each member institution needs to make sound investments in IT that achieve health system objectives, we are confident in its prospects for future growth. Third, through our collaboration relationship with HIMSS Analytics, we now have access to the HIMSS Analytics database on IT processes and environments, cost to management metrics and purchasing decisions, which is a fantastic set of information to enrich the work that we do with our member CIOs. In benchmarking and networking, it allows us to deliver a peer group that is targeted to a degree that was previously unavailable to us, a peer group based on specific IT environments. In addition, given the database's size and comprehensiveness, we are able to do a new level of in-depth research into the trends of adoption and use of health care IT. Because successful IT choices require deep expertise on the environment in which the system will operate, the data provides us a whole new way to support IT users, business users and clinical users across the full project planning and implementation cycle to yield successful IT projects that drive real returns. More broadly, all of these assets together, our IT strategy program, our Applications and Technologies Collaborative, our gathering depth of experienced IT experts and the HIMSS Analytics data, form an outstanding foundation for our healthcare IT practice going forward. As we build a comprehensive suite of offerings for elevating health system IT performance, we are tremendously excited about the value and impact that they provide to members. Further, given the level of spend, the complexity of the issue sets and our ability to effectively drive performance improvement through our unique membership model, we are confident about the long-term growth potential of our work in this terrain. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around five categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2010. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on a March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 17.6% to $66.7 million, up from $56.7 million in the same period last year. Net income and diluted earnings per share grew 10% and 7% respectively over the quarter ending June 30, 2009. Net income increased to $4.6 million, up from $4.2 million last year, and diluted earnings per share increased to $0.29 per share, up from $0.27 per share last year. EBITDA grew 26% to $9.5 million, up from $7.5 million in the same quarter the prior year. Cost of services was $34.6 million or 51.9% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2010, compared to $30.1 million or 53% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increases in cost of services are primarily due to increased costs associated with new programs, the continued expansion of our Crimson program and the incorporation of costs and amortization associated with our acquisitions of Southwind and Concuity. As a percent of revenue, cost of services decreased due to scalability of incremental revenue inherent in our model. Member relations and marketing expense was $15.2 million or 22.8% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2010, compared to $12.6 million or 22.1% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. We currently have 129 sales teams in place, an increase from the 111 sales teams we had in the quarter ended June 30, 2009. G&A expense increased to $8.2 million or 12.3% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2010, compared to $6.8 million or 11.9% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year, due primarily to increased investment in our new product development group, and to a lesser extent, increased staffing in our IT, HR and finance functions to support our expanding employee base. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $1.7 million or 2.5% of revenue compared to $1.9 million or 3.4% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. Other income net in the quarter was $221,000 compared to $962,000 in the same period the prior year. This quarter's other income consists of interest income of $297,000 and a loss of $76,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. During the quarter ended June 30, 2009, we had interest income of $580,000 and a gain of $382,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Turning to the balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased 30% to $162.4 million as of June 30, 2010, compared to $124.6 million as of June 30, 2009. DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables, were 209 days in the quarter ended June 30, 2010, up from 192 days as of June 30, 2009. The year-over-year increase in DSOs is due to the continued increase in mix towards the higher price point programs, which include more progress billings as well as more multi-year contracts. Excluding the effects of progress billings, DSOs on billed AR were 53 days as of June 30, 2010, compared to 49 days as of June 30, 2009. Deferred revenue, net amounts that we`ve billed after 12 months increased to $224.7 million as of June 30, 2010, up 31.4% from $171 million as of June 30, 2009. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2010, was $191.4 million, up 27.8% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow. During the three months ended June 30, 2010, we used $4.1 million of cash from operating activities compared to $2.6 million used in the operating activities in the same quarter the prior year. The first quarter of our fiscal year typically provides our lowest quarterly cash flow from operations. Looking at the first six months of the calendar year, for calendar year 2010, cash flow provided from operations was $15.1 million compared to $7 million for the same period the prior year. For fiscal year 2011, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be approximately 1.5x to 2x net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending June 30, 2010, were approximately $1.8 million compared to $732,000 for the same period the prior year. This increase is due to increased levels of capitalized expenditures associated with our analytic tools programs this year when compared to the same period the prior year. In the three months ended June 30, 2010, we repurchased $2 million of stock or approximately 52,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $310 million or approximately 7.4 million shares. As of June 30, 2010, the remaining authorized repurchase amount is $40 million. As of June 30, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $73 million, representing approximately $4.50 per share. As to contract value, our contract value increased 17.8% to $274.4 million as of June 30, 2010, up from $232.8 million as of June 30, 2009. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time, without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with more than 12 months` duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar 2010, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions, which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2010, we are raising our revenue growth guidance to a range of approximately 15% to 17% growth over calendar 2009, up from our previous guidance of 13% to 15% growth over calendar 2009. We're also raising our guidance for calendar 2010 adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Concuity that were incurred last quarter, to a range of approximately $37 million to $41 million, up from $35.5 million to $40.5 million, previously. We're also raising our calendar 2010 guidance for non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, which excludes the per share effect net of tax of the transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Concuity that were incurred in the quarter ending March 31, 2010, to a range of approximately $1.15 to $1.30 for the year, up from $1.11 to $1.27 previously. For the remainder of calendar 2010, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35 ½% to 36 ½%. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about our priorities for the rest of the year, and then we will take any questions you have. First, we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions and new relationships into the broader portfolio in order to ensure that we maximize the benefit, both to the membership and to the business, of the new products and services. Our successful Crimson integration, where we are now serving some 200 members covering more than 10% of all inpatient admissions on the Crimson platform, stands as a model here, and we are making strong progress in each of our other new relationships. As I discussed earlier, our work with HIMSS Analytics has been instrumental to refining our current IT strategy vision and developing a new product to help our members elevate IT performance and impact. Southwind, the acquisition we made back in December, is exceeding expectations, and has greatly enhanced our capability in the physician terrain. Finally, our Concuity acquisition is an important addition to our revenue cycle portfolio of programs. A good number of members have expressed interest in expanding their relationship to include Concuity, and we are preparing to scale that business over the coming year. Across all of these new endeavors, our early progress has been strong, and we are optimistic that with focus and hard work, each of these initiatives will yield important benefits for the firm's key strategic verticals. Second, as I've said before, the current environment presents unique circumstances driving tremendous needs within our membership and market. And we are continuing to invest in new product development efforts in order to take advantage of all the opportunities engendered by the broader industry changes. Our deep relationships with our members provide us a distinct advantage as we systematically explore their needs, create new programs to meet them and roll them out through our proven new product development methodology. With over 25 new product ideas in the pipeline, we expect to continue launching approximately four new programs per year to help our members address their challenges, and I'm confident that our ongoing focus on this area will continue to be a successful component of our business and growth strategy. Third, as we expand our portfolio, it is critical that value delivery across all of our programs remain a top priority for everyone in the firm. This is something that we never take for granted. Rather, we continue to work hard to deliver innovative researching tools, excellent service and real impact to members of every program. On this metric, we have also had a great first half of the year, with outstanding meeting scores, strong QA feedback, solid renewals and countless member stories of the measurable performance improvement they have derived as a result of their work with us. It is this track record that paves the way for deepening relationships with our members, and every employee's daily goal is to act purposefully in ways that strengthen and build on this critical asset. Fourth, we remain focused on flawless execution across all areas of the business, particularly in sales, marketing and account management. We've expanded our sales teams to 129 to ensure that we are taking advantage of all opportunities before us. And in addition, we continue to innovate to use information from all member touch points to build better relationship intelligence that can be leveraged across the firm to expand and deepen our member relationships. Our work here today continues to bear fruit with a strong June quarter on the books, and will remain a top priority for the rest of the year. Finally, as always, we continue to invest in attracting, engaging, developing and retaining world-class talents in all levels of the organization. I recently had the opportunity to host my annual series of town hall meetings for employees at all levels of the firm. It is always a fantastic opportunity for me to connect with our teams in smaller settings, to share information about our organizational performance and strategy and to engage in direct dialogue about issues important to our staff. Through simulcasts, we were able to include our growing staff at all our locations around the globe, and we received very strong feedback on the sessions. For my part, I left the series incredibly impressed with the engagement, commitment and energy of our employees at all levels, and I'm very proud to have such a high-caliber team working each day with our members to drive performance improvement and tangible impact. With a coherent focus across the organization, flawless execution, delivery of member value, new product development and integration of acquisitions, I'm confident that we have the right agenda in place for the year. This agenda, along with our deep member relationships and strong base of expertise, provides an outstanding foundation for our business and for continuing to elevate our impact and reach in the industries we serve. Thank you for participating in tonight's call, and why don't we take the time now to answer your questions."

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Thank you, good evening. I am Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, covering our financial results as well as discussion of some of the notable developments of the quarter. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our key operational and strategic priorities. As always, we will be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended June 30, 2011, Advisory Board revenues increased 22% to $81.6 million from $66.7 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2010. Net income was $3.9 million or $0.23 per diluted share compared to $4.6 million or $0.29 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $14.6 million for the quarter compared to $12.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Contract value increased 21% to $332.5 million as of June 30, 2011 up from $274.4 million as of June 30, 2010. Our strong performance for the quarter surpassed our expectations and highlights the sustained, urgent need for our products and services in the markets we serve. As our members face continued change they consistently turn to us for comprehensive solutions to their most pressing challenges. Our robust portfolio of offerings, excellent product quality, and measurable member impact in addressing these challenges were all key factors in achieving our robust revenue growth of 22% and contract value growth of 21% for the quarter. We are pleased that the superior start to calendar year 2011, along with the visibility inherent in our model, allows us to revise our outlook for the year, as we now increased our projections to revenue growth of 24% to 26% and adjusted EBITDA of $60 million to $64 million for calendar year 2011. Our growth outlook represents the continued strong traction we are seeing for our products and services in all areas of the business. Over the last two years as our members have faced unprecedented complexity and foundational shifts in their markets we’ve made significant investments to tailor our portfolio to meet member needs and take advantage of this unique environment. In addition we have also focused our existing programs to help members meet the imperative to simultaneously improve current performance and prepare for future structural industry changes. Together these innovations have complemented each other and allowed us to serve members in deeper more comprehensive ways. A work to assist members with physician alignment provides the good example. As healthcare purchases drive toward more accountable payment models and risk based contract and vehicles, hospitals much begin executing against the new value focus performance standard. In this context and given the power that physicians have over hospitals cost, quality and care coordination physician strategy almost universally top the agenda for our members today. In order to develop the infrastructure necessary to succeed in the changing market, members are seeking to align physician incentives, coordinate care cost settings and increasingly to employ physicians directly. Across the last several years, we’ve dramatically expanded our means to assist members in these endeavors. First, in our research program, we’ve developed a number of new and innovative ways of delivering insight on physician alignment to our members. These include a wide variety of self-serve online tools in analytics available on our member websites such as an accountable care diagnostics a clinical, integration investment calculator and a physician practice acquisition toolkit. Of course, physician integration topics have also driven our recent research agendas in these programs as well. Our special Chief Executive Roundtable meeting series that is currently underway is an example of the outstanding reception this work is getting, more than 700,000 health system chief executives are attending the roundtable meetings entitled accountable for value across this summer. The run rate blockbuster presentation at the meeting is the one focus on physician integration, with over 80% of CEOs ranking in excellence. It is incredibly exciting to be in the room with the CEOs as our latest insights about physician integration are presented to them. Their engagement with our research on this topic is astounding and the level of discussion around ideas we’ve surfaced is truly exceptional. Beyond our research work, our Crimson platform has proven to be an incredibly impactful way to work with members on physician alignment. The technology is flexible, intuitive data interface, that’s provided a homely way for hospital administrators to engage with physicians on cost and quality initiatives. It powers evident in the cast studies of our members using it. For example, Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, we run a cost efficiency projects with these physicians using Crimson are targeting just eight high volume diagnoses and leveraging Crimson to identify the root causes of variation and care provided. The hospital was able to develop care guidelines for these conditions helping to standardize and enhance care. As a result, the institution achieved nearly $3 million in savings while also improving key quality measures such as 30-day readmission rates. Across the Crimson membership this type of story is repeated over and over again. Given these results is no wonder that Crimson has so quickly become a critical part of our distinctiveness in serving members on physician alignment issues. The addition in December, 2009 of Southwind has further extended our portfolio of physician alignment solutions allowing us to work more closely with members, providing them direct physician practice management support and other physician integration services. Q2 our results have been stellar as the promise of combining Southwind’s strong brand, track record and expertise with The Advisory Board’s Crimson base and network of top executives from over 2,800 hospital and health systems has been realized. Southwind is in high-demand across this network, and the business has grown substantially while producing multiple exciting reference stories of higher [online]. Together Crimson and Southwind allow us to provide our members deeper, more powerful, and more comprehensive coverage of their most critical issues up. I’m pleased to announce today two new developments that further enhance our ability to serve members with physician practice management. First, we have launched the Crimson Practice Management Program, which provides actionable data to enhance the performance of physician practices and maximize their total health system contributions. As hospitals increasingly acquire physician practices with aim of enhancing care coordination, they’re seeing significant variation in the business performance of this practice, variation that can quickly have an impact on the hospitals bottom line. The Crimson Practice Management Program provides visibility into productivity, patient access, documentation and coding accuracy and collections efficiency, facilitating physicians’ participation and improvement initiatives in any practice setting whether hospital owned or independent. The program was developed on our Crimson platform, leveraging key intellectual property and expertise from Southwind and it’s an exciting example of the cross program synergies we are generating throughout the company, as we expand our portfolio in areas of key member needs. Second, yesterday, we acquired PivotHealth, LLC, a leading physician practice management firm based in Nashville, Tennessee. The transaction enhances our existing physician practice management capabilities and provides new growth opportunities with the addition of PivotHealth’s expertise in long-term practice management. We foresee increasing demand for these capabilities. As hospitals continue to acquire physician practices and speak outside practice management assistance to meet the immediate and downstream integration challenges that arise as a result. PivotHealth is distinctive in the healthcare industry offering a highly credible, outsource management solution for health system sponsored physician practices. In the customer reference calls, we completed is part of our due intelligence. PivotHealth receives all As with customer’s praising PivotHealth’s long-term commitment to execution, ability to forge strong physician relationships and Scale IT serving as the mutual third-party, able to point out flaws at both the hospital and physician practice and to bring the parties together to optimize performance. Just as with Southwind 19 months ago, we are confident that we’re bringing on a team and a set of leaders with strong values and a mission consistent with that of The Advisory Board. As a result, our culture alignment feels very good. We are looking forward to building on a Southwind business by adding PivotHealth’s capabilities, which in addition to longer-term practice management expertise also include physician and patient satisfaction surveys in coding and compliance education. Together PivotHealth, our successful Crimson technology platform and Southwind physician alignment services offer a fantastic combination to our members, a more comprehensive portfolio to support them in all aspects of physician integration. One of the most important need in managing practice as well as optimizing their revenue cycles. And before I turn the call over to Michael, I wanted to provide an update on our acquisition of Concuity which through its unique ability to integrate the facility and professional revenue cycle is another great asset we offer to assist members with that endeavor. Because Concuity provides the visibility to allow members to examine contracts holistically across inpatient, outpatient and ambulatory settings, it enable them to assess reimbursement structures that cover or bundle together hospital and physician payment. Visibility provides deeper insight into the true expected profitability of contract and populations and allows for more creative trade off during contracting. Beyond the upfront assessment, Concuity also provides functionality to manage the payment cycle including reconciling payments and managing underpayments and denials, in the same solution used to model the contract terms. This combination of functionality closes the loop between managed care contracting and the revenue cycle operation ensuring a theme of transition and constant feedback for the next contract assessment. As the size of the contracting entities grows from yesterdays inpatient facilities to tomorrows networks of integrated and affiliated providers, this single source of truth for contract performance becomes vital to insuring profitability amidst increasing complexity. These attributes are proven to be critical assets in the market and Concuity has been a great addition to both our strong revenue cycle franchise and our growing portfolio product focused on improving physician practice economics. Over the last year, our integration plan focused on four buckets of work, integrating the team into The Advisory Board, preparing the operations for rapid scale, expanding the product roadmap to not only serve existing customers but include new products development of the Concuity platform and of course scaling up our sales and marketing as the operations want. The good news is, we’ve made substantial progress against our plans in all four areas. In particular, we have increased our repeatability of the implementation process and driven down the implementation time resulting a much greater capacity to serve new members. In addition, as we’ve build up our sales and marketing team we have now doubled the Concuity membership to more than 70 hospitals and have seen a similar increase in the contract value of the business. As we look ahead, we anticipate continued strong performance and attracting new members on to the platform. In addition, we expect to see impactful delivery and relationship expansion with existing members where Concuity’s robust functionality and connections to multiple hospital source systems hardwire the products deeply into member operations, rendering both very useful and very sticky over the long-term. More broadly, our experience here and across our larger revenue cycle portfolio continues to highlight the importance of this area to our members. They consistently report that the meaningful bottom line improvement that they achieve as a result of their revenue cycle work with us, are critically important particularly in today’s environment. As such, we will continue to build on our revenue cycle solutions to insure that we serve members comprehensively on this important issue step. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around six categories; income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, the acquisition of PivotHealth and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2011. First on the income statement. A quick remainder, on our March 31st fiscal year-end, which means we just finished the first quarter of fiscal year 2012. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 23.4% $81.6 million up from $66.7 million in the same period of prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $14.6 million, $8.4 million and $0.50 respectively for the quarter ending June 30, 2011 compared to $12.4 million, $7.1 million and $0.45 respectively for the same quarter last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 exclude acquisition related cost and amortization as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non- GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including acquisition related cost and amortization as well as share-based compensation expense, GAAP net income and income per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 were $3.9 million and $0.23 respectively. Cost of services increased to $45.5 million or 55.7% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2011 compared to $34.6 million or 51.9% of revenue in the same quarter of prior year. Including cost of services for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 is a $3.2 million fair value adjustment to our Southwind acquisition-related earn out liabilities, resulting from strong performance and appreciation of The Advisory Board shares that are part of the contingent federation. Remaining increases in cost of services are due to increase expenses from new programs, our continued expansion of our Crimson platform and growth of our Southwind program. Member relations and marketing expenses was $18 million or 23% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2011 compared to $15.2 million or 22.8% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. We currently have 145 sales teams in place, an increase from the 129 sales teams in place ended June 30, 2010. G&A expense increased to $10.8 million or 13.3% of revenue in quarter ended June 30, 2011 compared to $8.2 million or 12.3% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year due primarily to an increase in talent improvement and new product development expenses as well as increased investment in human resource and finance functions to support our growing employee. Also included in G&A expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 were cost of $144,000 related to our recently announced acquisition. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $1.9 million or 2.4% of revenue compared to $1.7 million or 2.5% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. Other income net in the quarter was $797,000 compared to $221,000 at the same period of prior year. This quarter’s other income consist of interest income of $585,000 and the gain of $212,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. during the quarter ended June 30, 2010, we had interest income of $297,000 and a loss of $76,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable which excludes long term receivables increased to $197.6 million as of June 30, 2011 compared to $162.4 million as of June 30, 2010. DSOs which we calculate using average receivables was 210 days in the quarter ended June 30, 2011 and were 209 days as of June 30, 2010. Excluding the effect of progress payments, DSOs on bill day are 46 days as of June 30, 2011, down from 53 days as of June 30, 2010 due to improved collections. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we billed up to 12 months increased to $290 million as of June 30, 2011, up 29.1% from $224.7 million as of June 30, 2010. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts the deferred revenue balances between 30, 2011 was $234.8 million up 22.7% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ended June 30, 2011, our cash generated from operating activities $4.6 million compared to cash used in operating activities of $4.1 million in the same quarter last year. Calendar year to-date, we’ve generated cash flow from operations of 1.5 times adjusted net income, compared to 1.1 times adjusted net income for the same period last year. For fiscal year 2012, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be approximately 1.5 to 2 times adjusted net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending June 30, 2011 were approximately $6.5 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period last year. This increase was due to the increased level of investment associated with our analyst improved program this year. In addition, capital expenditures for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 included increased and refilled improvements relating to extension of our office base and software development costs for internal projects. For the three months ended June 30, 2011, we repurchased $2.3 million of stocks or approximately 50,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the exception program in 2004 to $318 million or approximately 7.6 million shares. As of June 30, 2011, the remaining authorized share repurchase amount was approximately $31 million. As of June 30, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $118.8 million, representing approximately $7 per diluted share. As to contract value, contract value increased 21.2% to $332.5 million as of June 30, 2011 up from $274.4 million as of June 30, 2010. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or the remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts of more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. Turning to PivotHealth, the company has also announced that we have purchased all the assets of PivotHealth, a physician practice management firm. The purchase price is approximately $60 million with additional potential consideration to be paid at certain business performance conditions are met across the next three years. The PivotHealth acquisition contributed approximately $6 million to $7 million of incremental revenue in calendar year 2011 with minimal impacts on adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS. We expected to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS in calendar year 2012. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2011, the following comments are intended to fall under the safe harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar year 2011, we are raising our revenue guidance to range for approximately $342 million to $349 million up from our previous guidance range of $318 million to $326 million. We are also raising our guidance for calendar year 2011 adjusted EBITDA to a range roughly $60 million to $64 million up from $56 million to $60 million previously. This guidance includes $6 million to $7 million of revenue and $0.5 million of adjusted EBITDA from the acquisition of PivotHealth in calendar year 2011. For calendar year 2011, we are also increasing our guidance for non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to a range of approximately $2 to $2.13 up from the range of $1.85 to $2 previously. For calendar 2011, we expect share based compensation expense to be approximately $10 million and amortization from acquisition related intangibles due approximately $5 million. For the remainder of calendar year 2011, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 37.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I’ll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Thanks, Michael. I would like to close with a few comments about our priorities for the rest of the year and then we will take any questions you have. As always, our first priority is ensuring continued outstanding value delivery to members, members know that and for this reason that they turn to us in complex time such as this. solving members’ problems, the burning issue for employees in all levels of the firm and for this reason they work each day to deliver innovation, excellent service and real impact to the members of every program.

At this time I will turn the call over to the company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you and good evening. I’m Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board Company and I’m joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a 3-part agenda for this evening’s call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, covering our financial results as well as a discussion of some of the notable developments in the quarter. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials and finally I will close with an update on our key operational and strategic priorities. As always, we’ll be happy to take questions at the end of the session and additionally we’ll be hosting our Investor Day here in our Washington, D.C. office on September 27, which I hope many of you will join and where of course you’ll have the opportunity to ask questions of both of us plus other members of The Advisory Board team. In the quarter ended June 30, 2012, Advisory Board revenues increased 30% to $104.1 million from $79.9 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2011. Net income was $3.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share compared to $3.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $20.2 million for the quarter compared to $14.1 million in F1Q 2012. Contract value increased 26% to $411.6 million as of June 30, 2012, up from $327.1 million as of June 30, 2011. Our continued strong performance this quarter reflects the ongoing complexity of our member space and a deep reliance on our software, research and management and advisory services. Through our robust portfolio of offerings, superior member service and outstanding product quality we consistently provide measurable impact for our members as they tackle the many uncertainties and challenges in today’s changing healthcare market. Of course, the most notable healthcare event last quarter was the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case challenging the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- the Obama healthcare reform legislation. On June 28th the Supreme Court upheld the majority of the legislation including the individual mandate provision, while also effectively making the Act’s Medicaid expansion voluntary for states. When the ruling came down our 3100 member healthcare institutions immediately looked to us in helping to make sense of it. Our team of experts who had been tracking the legal and political journey of the case did an outstanding job, publishing an incisive initial analysis of the decision within minutes of its announcement. This was followed within days by a detailed analysis of the strategic, financial, and operational challenges presented by the changes to the ACA, updated financial modeling on the impact of the ruling to providers’ long-term margin performance, and a series of interactive web conferences discussing the likely options ahead for Congress, state governments, payers and providers in the wake of the Supreme Court’s historic decision. Member reaction to these resources has been overwhelming. The analysis is the most read of any pieces we have published to date. Over 4000 have logged into our Supreme Court Ruling Margin Impact Analysis tool and 1300 individuals participated in our interactive web conferences. Across all of the resources members praise our timely and actionable insight. Interestingly, despite the headline-grabbing excitement over the ruling, our own take on the broader imperatives for our members was unchanged and would have largely remained so regardless of the outcome of the case. Forces outside our political and legal system, the coming bolus of aging, sicker baby boomers and the growing budget orientation of both public and private healthcare purchasers mean that healthcare providers necessarily must transition from a focus on volume to a focus on value. That said, the ruling underscores this message, alleviating to some extent some of the uncertainty surrounding the strategic questions facing providers. [indiscernible] is here to stay and the time to focus on transforming patient care across the continuum is now. As our members seek to do so they look to The Advisory Board for guidance on how to simultaneously improve current performance and prepare for the industry-wide structural changes gathering increasing momentum. Let me give one example. In preparation for value-based payment contracts, and in response to the increasing numbers of older, sicker patients with chronic conditions, hospitals and health systems have begun investing in a variety of services to be able to care for those patients outside the inpatient setting. These include things like patient-centered medical homes, physician practice acquisitions, clinical integration networks, health coaches, care teams, and new clinical technology. Done right this so-called “medical perimeter” around the inpatient enterprise will be a key to hospitals’ ability to be in the driver’s seat as the market moves to value-based care. However, as many of our members are realizing, infrastructure alone is not enough. Visibility into and real management of performance is critical to success. Specifically there are 3 things hospitals and health systems need to do well in pursuit of care transformation: collaborate with physicians to advance cost and quality goals, improve population health through proactive care management, and optimize the network by managing total cost and quality for key populations. We are helping members with each through a variety of initiatives, products, and services. For example, collaboration with physicians to advance cost and quality goals has been a key topic for us in our research programs for years and we continue to build on our deep knowledge base of best practices in this area. Right now we are hosting our annual series of CEO roundtable meetings and one of the session’s most popular presentations is on this very topic. It is entitled From Contract to Compact: Moving physician partnerships beyond financial alignment to create a culture of clinical success, and it focuses on such key imperatives as remaking physician culture, redesigning physician governance for continuing cross- collaboration, and driving clinical transformation at scale. In addition, as we’ve discussed in the past our flagship Crimson Membership -- now more than 500 hospital and health system members strong -- is a critical tool in sponsoring and facilitating collaboration with physicians through its unique view of clinical utilization and care quality. We recently heard from one member who had struggled in the past to get traction with physicians on care design projects. After joining Crimson the health system was able to effectively engage physicians to refine and standardize the care process for specific diseases, yielding over $2 million in ROI. The health system’s Chief Nursing Officer told us “The work of our care redesign project would not have been possible without Crimson. It has allowed us to engage our physicians and physician leaders in data- driven rapid cycle improvement that has had a huge impact across our organization.” With dozens of stories like this across the membership it is clear that Crimson allows hospitals to work effectively with physicians, the key drivers of both quality and cost performance. As members seek to improve population health through proactive care management, our patient-centered medical home project has provided interesting insights on the research side, while Crimson Care Registry offers a dynamic tool that prompts physicians on recommended care for each individual patient. With more than 100 evidence-based care guidelines and prompts along with its growing data asset of more than 2 million patient records, Crimson Care Registry improves quality outcomes and is a key tool for proactive care management in the more than 250 physician practices using it nationwide. Over the last months we’ve also been expanding our ability to support those institutions rating their contracts based on risk, helping them optimize their network by managing total cost and quality for key populations. And today I’m pleased to formally announce the launch of Crimson Population Risk Management, the newest addition to our Crimson platform. Research has shown that there’s a wide variation of population healthcare costs and quality outcomes that can be impacted by the effective delivery of care. In fact, loosely managed populations are 60% more costly than those that are well managed, a delta that quickly adds up to millions of dollars over relatively small populations. However, many health systems, even those already taking on risks for defined populations, often lack the data and tools to manage a population well. These include the ability to reduce inappropriate utilization, understand and manage patient care outside the network, activate patients with chronic conditions to treat themselves better, and accurately identify and manage high-risk individuals. Crimson Population Risk Management provides a software tool that combines clinical- and claims-based data including a benchmarking database of over 45 million lives and $2.5 billion in claims to drive best- in-class population risk analytics. The program enables members to prioritize opportunities for clinical and financial improvement at the population level and provides analytics that can assist with a wide range of patient health initiatives. With its robust analytical backbone the program is supporting members in their efforts to transform care delivery while simultaneously ensuring strong financial performance within the changing healthcare landscape. In addition, with the Crimson Population Risk Management cohort we would also expect some of the more preventive health systems to seek a deeper level of management support on population health, taking the extra step of working with Evolent, the company with which we made a founding investment late last year. With Evolent’s rapidly growing and talented team currently working with its initial customers on initiatives ranging from the launch of Medicare Advantage plans to unique commercial payer partnerships, to turnkey health system employee benefit offerings, we anticipate continued interesting synergies. Let me now turn the agenda over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I’ve organized today’s financial review around 6 categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, the new credit facility, and finally our outlook for the remainder of calendar 2012. First, the income statement: a quick reminder that we're on a March 31st fiscal year end, which means we’ve just completed F1Q 2013. Please also note that all prior period earnings per share numbers have been adjusted to reflect our 2-for-one stock split that was effective on June 18th. For the quarter just ended our revenue increased 30.3% to $104.1 million up from $79.9 million in the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending June 30, 2012, increased 43% to $20.2 million up from $14.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted net income was $11.1 million compared to $8.2 million last year and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.31 compared to $0.24 last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 exclude transaction-related costs and amortization, equity and loss of unconsolidated entity, discontinued operations as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including transactional-related costs and amortization, equity and income of unconsolidated entity, discontinued operations and share-based compensation expense GAAP net income and income per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, were $3.8 million and $0.11 respectively. Before discussing the rest of the income statement I want to highlight a change in the way we are reporting our cost of services and depreciation amortization account. Previously, our cost of service line included amortization associated with certain software development and our previous acquisitions. Going forward, we have consolidated all amortization into the depreciation amortization line on our income statement. We believe this will simplify the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results and provide a more accurate view of our cost of services. Cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization through the quarter increased to $58.4 million or 56% of revenue compared to $43.2 million or 54% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in the cost of services are due to increased expenses for new and growing programs primarily related to our physician products as well as expenses from our acquisition of Pivot Health in August, 2011, that we didn’t have last year. Also included in cost of services for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were $3.5 million and $3.2 million respectively in fair value adjustments to our various acquisition and [indiscernible] liabilities. Member relations and marketing spend was $19.1 million or 18.4% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2012, compared to $17.9 million or 22.4% of revenue in the same period in the prior year. We currently have 162 sales teams in place compared to 145 sales teams in place in the quarter ended June 30, 2011. G&A expense increased to $13.5 million or 12.9% of revenue in the quarter ending June 30, 2012, compared to $10.8 million or 13.5% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year due primarily to an increase in personnel costs, infrastructure, and investments in our IT, HR, Legal and Finance functions to support our growing employee base. Depreciation amortization expense in the quarter includes the amounts that were previously-recorded cost services were $4.1 million or 3.9% of revenue compared to $2.9 million or 3.7% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year due to increased amortization from capital investments for our growing technology programs and the Pivot acquisition in August, 2011, as well as additional depreciation from leaseholder improvements relating to expansion space in our Austin and DC offices. Other income net in the quarter was $576,000 compared to $797,000 in the same period of the prior year. This quarter’s other income consists of interest income of $824,000 and the loss of $248,000 due to changes of foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, we had interest income of $585,000 and a gain of $212,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Turning to the balance sheet membership fees receivables, which excludes long-term receivables, increased to $354.9 million as of June 30, 2012, compared to $197.6 million as of June 30, 2011. Excluding the effect of progress payments, DSOs and [indiscernible] were 55 days as of June 30, 2012, compared to 45 days at June 30, 2011; and 56 days at March 31, 2012. Deferred revenue net of amounts that we’ve billed after twelve months increased to $468.9 million as of June 30, 2012, up from $290.0 million as of June 30, 2011. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance at June 30, 2012, was $386.4 million, up 65% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, our cash generated by operating activities was $1.6 million compared to $4.7 million generated from operating activities in the same quarter last year. For F2013 we continue to expect cash flow generated from operations to be in our typical range of 1.5x to 2x net adjusted income. Capital expenditures for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, were approximately $8.5 million compared to $6.7 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2011. The increase is due to increased levels of investment associated with our software-based programs. For the 3 months ended June 30, 2012, we repurchased $3 million of stock or approximately 63,000 shares, which brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $326 million or 15.3 million shares. As of June 30, 2012, the remaining authorized share repurchase amount was $24 million. As of June 30, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $189 million representing approximately $5.24 per diluted share. Our contract value increased 25.8% to $411.6 million as of June 30, 2012, up from $327.1 million as of June 30, 2011. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to the actual term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts of more than a 12-month duration we include only 12 months of contract value. On the credit facility, on June 30, 2012, we obtained a new, 5-year $150 million senior secured credit facility from a syndicate of banks led by JP Morgan Chase. Funds available under the credit facility can be used for general corporate purposes including potential strategic acquisitions. We have no immediate plans to draw against this facility. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar 2012 the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions outlined at the end of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. We’re increasing our revenue guidance for calendar 2012 to a range of approximately $426 million to $432 million up from a range of $420 million to $430 million previously. We are also updating our guidance for calendar 2012 adjusted EBITDA to range of approximately $79 million to $82 million up from a range of $77 million to $82 million previously. For calendar 2012 we are also updating our guidance for non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to a range of approximately $1.20 to $1.25 from a range of $1.20 to $1.30 adjusted for the effects of the company’s 2-for-1 stock split effective on June 18, 2012. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance reflects the effect of a higher share price on our estimated share count, expenses related to our new revolving credit facility, and foreign exchange losses incurred in the June quarter. For calendar 2012 we expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $14 million and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets to be approximately $5 million. For calendar 2012 we expect an effective tax rate in the range from approximately 38.0% to 38.5%. This concludes the financial summary, and now I’ll turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about our priorities headed into the second half of the calendar year and then we’ll take any questions you have. As always, delivering member value remains the top priority throughout our organization. With impact stories raging from the health system that leveraged one of our revenue cycle programs to capture nearly $3 million in additional reimbursements to the Crimson member who has achieved over $10.5 million in cost savings over a multiyear partnership with us, it is clear that across our programs members are achieving significant ROI based on their work with us. Building on these types of success we are constantly pushing ourselves to enhance our research, software, service, and impact. We are leveraging the unique insight we gleam from our hundreds of member interactions daily, not only to serve individual members but also to build deeper intelligence on the membership as a whole. This dual focus allows us both to execute on the relationship stewardship and cultivation so key to our success, and also to translate the intelligence into new product launches that meet and even anticipate member needs which brings us to the second of our priorities. Today’s market complexity and change continue to provide unprecedented opportunities to develop new programs and services to support our members, and our ability to rapidly take advantage of opportunities with new product launches and extensions remains critical. Given the importance of speed to market and the success of our approach to strategic acquisitions, business development continues to be a strong complement to our organic new product development. As such, we have devoted resources to both organic MPDs and acquisition evaluations and I’m confident that together these activities will continue our track record of new product development success. Third, as we head into the third calendar quarter we are extremely focused at all levels on finishing out the year with good momentum. In particular strong execution across sales, marketing and renewals will be very important to set up next year, yielding the revenue to both invest in the future while also delivering bottom line expansion. Our commercial teams are fully resourced and have at their disposal both the tools and deep member intelligence to continue executing to the highest standard across the second half of the year. Finally, our commitment to attracting, cultivating, engaging, and retaining world-class talent is unwavering. A variety of initiatives at all levels of the firm are focused on these goals and we are ever vigilant to ensure that current and prospective employees are both aware of and able to take advantage of our successes, impact in the industry and future prospects. In particular I’ve been excited to watch our talented Development Team grow to over 500 as they continue to demonstrate an unparalleled ability to take the best practice insights from our research and translate them into world-class analytic tools in every area of the hospital, impacting performance in every area critical to future health system success. Because our organization is critical to our ongoing ability to serve our members and deliver on our commitments to investors it remains a top priority to me personally and to our entire leadership team. The dedication, energy and talent I observe each day in my interactions with our staff at all levels illustrates the success of our talent formula, and my confidence in our future prospects is based in large measure on the depth of our outstanding talent base. I am as always very proud of all of our employees and the excellent work that they do. Thank you for participating in tonight’s call. We will now open up the line for your questions."

Consequently actual operation or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. The company undergoes no obligation to update any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. At this time, I will turn the call over to the company’s Executive Chairman, Mr. Frank Williams. Frank Williams Thank you and good evening. I am Frank Williams, Executive Chairman of The Advisory Board, and I am joined this evening by Robert Musslewhite, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. In terms of this evening’s call, I have organized the discussion into four sections. First I will give you a brief summary of our performance for the quarter that ended September 30, 2008. I’ll then turn it over to Robert to provide additional information about the overall environment and an update on the business. Michael will then take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And Robert will close with a discussion of our strategic and operational priorities. Of course, we’ll be happy to take you questions at the close of the call. Let me start with our financial results. In the quarter ended September 30, 2008, Advisory Board revenues were $57.6 million, up 6% from $54 million last year. Net income was $5.4 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to $8.5 million or $0.45 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Contract value grew 6% to $230.6 million. Our results were largely in line with the expectations that we outlined at the end of last quarter, and are reflective of the current macroeconomic environment. The slower growth in contract value is a result of the more difficult new business environment that we began seeing in the May time period and which has continued through the September quarter. Given the fluidity of the overall economy, as well as the importance of strong performance in the December quarter in setting up next year’s growth, I wanted to make sure that we provided a clear sense of the overall environment, as well as some more granular detail on what we are seeing across the business. With that in mind, let me turn the call over to Robert to give a more detailed performance update. Robert Musslewhite Thanks, Frank. I thought I’d begin with a review of product quality and renewals, details on the new business environment and sources of growth and an update on key operational issues. First, from the core program perspective, we’ve continued to see strong renewal performance with high program utilization and attachment to our research agendas. We’ve done significant work across programs to respond to the environment and help members understand the likely impact of broader economic forces and the dynamics of their reimbursement environment, financial strategy and future growth prospects. Further, we’ve invested considerable resources in accelerating the financial benefit our members receive through their research, and in ensuring that members are leveraging all resources available to them through each programs in order to achieve these results. As I will discuss later, these initiatives have had strong impact for our members and have been very well received. Finally, we’re feeling good about our work in the education space. Across the last several months, we’ve held member meetings in each of the programs and have achieved excellent penetration and outstanding feedback on the content presented. It is encouraging to have this evidence that our value proposition in this segment is strong. In terms of the new business environment, conversion rates have continued at roughly the same levels we’ve seen since May and June. Breaking down the sales process into its components, we continue to see strong attachment in the market through our offerings, and we were able to build healthy new business pipelines. However closing the business has become more challenging as uncertainty about 2009 budgets has led to increased conservatism in the market. As we talk to our members about the economy, they’ve not been reporting rapid deterioration in their current financial performance. However, members are generally adopting more of a wait and see attitude relative to new purchase decisions, in some cases postponing the decision with the hopes that they will be able to gain additional clarity about projected finances in 2009. Examining sources of growth, we are seeing the impact of the environment primarily in cross sell and new program roll outs with slightly less impact on price increase. Turning to our analytical tools programs, I wanted to update you on the work we’ve been doing to build out infrastructure that will address scalability on a long term basis. We continue to make good progress in creating a more predictable data extraction process in ensuring smooth and consistent implementations. As expected, during this period, we’re still seeing some impact from delayed start dates and extended membership terms. We’re confident however that our investment in this area is an important one and that it will set us up well for the longer term. Turning to the plan we discussed in our last call that we put in place over the summer, we’ve done a great deal of work to execute at a high standard from our renewal and new business perspective, particularly given that 40% of renewals and new business traditionally come in across the December quarter. Because this period is a critical one in setting up next year’s performance, we currently have intense organizational focus on executing against this plan. The three elements of the plan are, driving strong sales execution, enhancing our program value propositions, and leveraging thoughtful investments in new product development to set up our forward growth objectives. Let me now update you on each of these initiatives in turn. Given the current environment, nothing is more important than strong sales execution. We continue to drive urgency on this point across the company by engaging the entire senior team as well as the best minds from our research organization in supporting our sales efforts. This group continues to assist in honing our message to key segments, enriching training for sales teams, and continuously evaluating talent allocation to ensure that top talent is deployed against the best opportunities. We are also very focused on building and maintaining a strong base of sales talent, taking advantage of the positive hiring environment, maintaining strong recruiting pipelines, and moving aggressively to bring new talent into the sales force. As we do so, we are also investing additional resources in training and on boarding to minimize the time to productive visits and providing deeper support out in the field to improve effectiveness on those early sales calls. From a program perspective, the challenges in the broader environment actually provide us with an important opportunity to illustrate for our members the power and impact of our timely research tools and services. As I mentioned earlier, across the last few months, we’ve developed a comprehensive approach across all of our programs to help our members address the concerns raised by the economy, and I thought I’d share a few examples. First, our research teams across all terrains have done extensive outreach to provide immediate in depth analysis to help members make sense of the news and understand the likely impact on their institutions. For our members meetings attended by more than 500 CEOs and CFOs to action memos from our programs heads, to online rapid response companions of best practices, our teams have created a vast set of opportunities for members to access our insight on the complex and unpredictable environment in the ways that are most directly helpful to their daily work. In addition to our analysis, during this time, we are directly supporting members in the critical decisions that they face. Whether they are leveraging our margin performance audit tools to services cost saving opportunities, revamping their capital allocation process using our tools kits, or leveraging our clinical technology assessments to guide specific new technology purchase decisions, members are relying on our guidance to make decisions on key issues quickly and with confidence. Finally, through their work with us, members are seeing the measurable financial impact so critical in times of economic uncertainties. A member of our bad debt performance program has increased collections by more than $600,000 this year alone. A member of our supply chain performance program has seen more than $0.5 million in improved contract performance. And another member leveraged through our best practice installation programs to triple emergency department cash collection in less than one year. Across all of our programs, we are seeing these types of hard financial results, documenting impact and sharing success stories to enhance the collective performance of our membership as a whole. The last element of our plan is continuing our ongoing focus on robust new product development in order to take advantage of our $4 billion five year organic growth opportunity. As we discussed in our last call, we’ve a number of strong new initiatives underway and we continue to prioritize their development. In order to best execute against these and the other opportunities within our pipeline of more than 25 MPD concepts, we’ve allocated additional talent to ensure we’re able to move aggressively to bring the right products to market at the right time. Today I am excited to announce our newest launch, the Patient Registration Performance Program, a particularly timely new introduction as today’s economic challenges bring a spotlight to hospitals’ revenue cycle performance. We’re receiving feedback from member revenue cycle officers, this membership provides a comprehensive program to assist health systems in improving their front end revenue cycle performance through the proactive management of the patient registration process. As background, research shows that more than 75% of the errors that give rise to coverage denials originate at the point of patient registration. To address this issue, the Patient Registration Performance Program provides a web based analytic tool that audits the registration process, surfaces patterns and registration errors, and allows for improved standardization of registration work flow. The tool is complemented by The Advisory Board’s rich body of research and best practices in increasing collections in a dynamic payment environment. Together, the services assist members in hardwiring accountability for front end revenue cycle performance thereby enhancing cash acceleration and staff efficiency while reducing avoidable denials. Our early work shows that improved registration accuracy can accelerate cash collections by 15% yielding AR improvements of more than 4 days and resulting in an impact of approximately $6 million to $7 million for an average sized hospital. As always we’ve worked with a strong group of charter advisers for the program including Tri City Medical Center, Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, Munroe Regional Medical Center, and West Jefferson Medical center. The launch of the Patient Registration Performance Program brings our total number of programs to 39, 11 of which are web based tools programs, and we are excited about its potential to provide value to our members. Also in terms of our recent physician management launch, we are seeing an encouraging response from the membership and real attachment to the issue. It is still early on, but we feel good about the prospects in this terrain and are excited about the program’s potential as we head into next year. In terms of our organization, we continue to scale our direct sales force in line with our plans for the year with a 113 sales teams currently in place, up from 101 teams at this time last year. Total Advisory Board head count now stands at more than 975 people and we have the depth of talent to scale our organization to accommodate future growth. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in greater detail. Michael Kirshbaum Thanks, Robert. I’ve organized today’s financial review around five categories income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and the outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2008. First the income statement, a quick reminder that we are on a March 31 fiscal year end which means we’ve just finished the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 6.7% to $57.6 million, up from $54 million in the same period last year. Income from operations, net income and earnings per diluted share were $7 million, $5.4 million and $0.32 respectively for the quarter ending September 30, 2008, compared to $11.2 million, $8.5 million, and $0.45 respectively the same quarter last year. Cost of services increased to 50.3% of revenue compared to 45.1% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in cost of services is primarily due to the increased cost associated with new programs launches, increased consultant and licensing fees associated with some of our newer analytic tool programs, and cost from our Crimson acquisition. The increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the factors mentioned above as well as the impact of lower revenue growth on our largely fixed cost structure. Member relations and marketing expense were 22.7% of revenue compared to 20.7% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in expenses is attributable mainly to the continuing investment in expanding our number of sales teams. We currently have 113 sales teams in place compared to 101 in September 2007. G&A expense in the quarter increased to 12.5% of revenue compared to 11.8% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year due to increased new product development costs as well as increases in staffing in our recruiting, benefits and training departments required to support our overall head count growth. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter increased to 2.3% of revenue compared to 1.6% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the amortization of capitalized cost related to the development of analytic tools for some of our newer programs, the amortization of intangibles from the Crimson acquisition and the additional depreciation expense related to the expansion of additional floors in our headquarters facility. Moving on to our six month income statement results, for the six months ending September 30, 2008, revenue increased 9.2% to $114.8 million, up from $105.1 million last year. Income from operations, net income and earnings per diluted share were $15.3 million, $11.7 million and $0.68 respectively for the six months ending September 30, 2008, compared to $20.3 million, $15.6 million and $0.83 respectively for the same period last year. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable, which exclude long term receivables, increased to $99.3 million as of September 30, 2008, versus $68.6 million as of September 30, 2007. DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables, were 158 days in the quarter ended September 30, 2008, up from 143 days last quarter and up from 116 days in September 30, 2007. Excluding receivables associated with the revenue from multi year contracts that will be recognized beyond 12 months, DSOs were 133 days in the quarter ended September 30, 2008, compared to 110 days in the prior year. The increase in DSOs is primarily due to the continued increase in mix for our higher price point programs which include more progress billings. Excluding the effect of progress payment, DSOs on bill day remain consistent with our expectations and was 55 days as of September 30, 2008, similar to the same metric in 2007, which was 52 days. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we billed out for 12 months, increased 26.2% to $150.2 million as at September 30, 2008, up from $119 million in September 30, 2007. Excluding prepaid contracts and long term deferred, deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2008, was $130.7 million, up 18% over the prior year. Turning to cash flow, during the three months ended September 30, 2008, we generated $12.2 million of cash from operating activities compared to 14.8 million in the same quarter last year. For the six months ending September 30, 2008, cash flow generated from operations was $12.3 million compared to $14.6 million in the same period last year. For fiscal year 2009, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be approximately one and a half to two times net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending September 30, 2008, were approximately $3.8 million, of which $1.3 million was related to the capitalized development and hardware associated with the analytic tools including some of our newer programs and $1.8 million was related to the build out of a new floor in our DC headquarters. For fiscal year 2009, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $15 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2008, we repurchased 34.5 million of stock or approximately 1.1 million shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $285.9 million or approximately 6.4 million shares. As of September 30, 2008, the remaining authorized repurchased amount was $64.1 million. As of September 30, 2008, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $88 million. As for contract values, contract value increased 6% to $230.6 million as of September 30, 2008, up from $217.5 million as of September 30, 2007. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreement. For contracts with more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months in contract value. With respect to the remainder of calendar 2008, the following comments are intended to fall under the safe harbor provision outlined at the beginning of the call, and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar year 2008, we expect revenue and earnings per diluted share to be consistent with the lower end of our annual guidance range. For the quarter ending December 30, 2008, we expect revenue of approximately $59.2 million to $60 million, and earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.36 to $0.39. Included in this earnings per diluted share guidance is approximately $0.14 to $0.15 of share based compensation and related expense for the December quarter. This concludes the financial summary. I’ll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert Musslewhite Thanks, Michael. I would like to close by offering a few comments on our plans for the next several quarters and then we will be happy to take questions. Across the coming months, our focus is on mitigating the impact of the broader economy while also enhancing critical areas that will serve us well in any market environment. Sales performance, new product development and investing in our employees and building the organization. Of course, sales performance is and will continue to be a top priority. As I mentioned earlier in the call, leadership across the firm is engaged in ensuring that our sales execution is at the highest standard. In addition to the current initiatives I’ve already mentioned, we are looking ahead to next year in introducing innovative methodologies to continue to improve our targeting of member specific needs. We began developing new processes and approaches to capture and funnel the knowledge we received about our member organizations through each of our myriad of interactions, thoughtfully synthesizing and processing all this information in the context of tailored member service and growth plans will increase our values as trusted advisor term members as well as enhancing opportunities for future relationship expansion. In terms of new product development, we continue to pursue with tremendous energy and we are confident about the potential of the many business ideas in our pipeline. Of course given the environment, in the near term we will continue to launch programs to serve members on critical nuts and bolts operational issues. Across the medium term, there are also large and important strategic trends that we know will provide us opportunities to deliver significant value to our members and rapidly expand our products and services. These include among others the continued and accelerated market push for quality and transparency, paid for performance reimbursement scenarios, the increased role of the consumer and provider choice and the need to increase profitable growth. While we’ve faced some current economic headwinds, we continue to feel good about the long term growth potential within the US healthcare market given the many complex issues that we can effectively address in a membership model and the fact that our average member is still spending only a small portion of their related professional services budget on The Advisory Board. In addition, we are also excited about a few of the other market segments we are emphasizing for expansion, including our early work in higher education in the international market, both of which have been met with enthusiastic feedback from members. Finally, as always, my leadership team and I are very focused on the organization, expanding our talent base, developing our existing staff and harnessing the energy of an engaged workforce are critical to our long term growth. In this more challenging economy, daily conversations with members underscore for our employees the importance of our work. With this powerful reminder of our mission, our nearly 1,000 employees stand fully committed to serving our membership and making a meaningful impact on the healthcare and education sectors. It is impressive to see this dedication and it gives me confidence in the future that this talented group can build together. With that, let me now turn to your questions."

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. You may proceed. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you, and good evening. I'm Robert Musslewhite, CEO of the Advisory Board. And I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, covering our financial results, as well as our two new program launches and a discussion of some of the key drivers of our performance. I will then turn it over to Michael, who will take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our top operational and strategic priorities heading into the close of the calendar year. As always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended September 30, 2010, Advisory Board revenue increased 22% to $71.1 million from $58.3 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Contracts value grew 20% to $284.7 million as of September 30, 2010, up from $237.6 million as of September 30, 2009. EBITDA was $9.4 million for the quarter, 26% growth over adjusted EBITDA of $7.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010, and earnings per diluted share were $0.30 for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 compared with non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.26 for the same period a year ago. We're pleased with our performance for the quarter. As health systems seek to navigate this period  of enormous change and uncertainty in the industry, we're seeing strong attachment in the market to our agendas, tools and services, as well as tremendous utilization by current members. Perhaps most importantly, members also continue to credit our work with specific improvements to their bottom lines, cementing our sustained relationships with them and providing the foundation for additional relationship expansion. It is this strong value that we provide our members that has driven our ongoing momentum that we have seen across this year, as well as our return to solid top and bottom-line growth with renewals and sales continuing to perform well across the quarter. As we head into our busiest renewal and sales season of the year, we are mindful that providing meaningful impacts on our member's most critical and most complex problems will continue to be central to our success. In terms of the market, the biggest topic on our member's mind remains the impact of health care reform and the movement towards more accountable models of care. With healthcare financing under strain due to aging Baby Boomers and coverage expansion, policymakers and payors are increasingly focused on obtaining greater value from healthcare expenditures. As a result, new reimbursement models are being introduced that shift both performance and utilization risks onto providers. And in response to these new incentives, providers are seeking to become more coordinated, more integrated, more reliable, lower costs and more focused on treating chronic disease in a sustainable way. These new reimbursement models include enhanced value-based purchasing, re-admission penalties, bundled payments and shared savings programs among others. Under these models, every hospital, health system and physician will seek to achieve higher levels of performance and will need to make strategic choices about future organizational direction. It is a complex landscape indeed for our members, and as they navigate it, they consistently look to us for help in setting course. Across the past two years, the Advisory Board has dedicated unprecedented resources to running deep on these topics. Working with policymakers, private payors, pioneering provider organizations and the like to surface strategic insights and operational best practices. In doing so, we continue to develop the foremost set of expertise and tools in all the areas that providers must address in order to successfully manage the transition to new models of care in an era of greater accountability for outcomes and costs. Across these areas, we offer a robust mix of research, insight and tools through our traditional membership programs. And through our software and services offerings, also bring to bear our world-class data analytics and the full-scale of our considerable experience in provider change in performance management. Our work on physician alignment provides one good example. Advisory Board research programs provide an incredible set of studies, meetings and teleconferences on key issues and physician alignment, such as partnering with physicians to transform care delivery, maximizing the returns of employee practices and engaging the mixed medical staff and value creation. In addition, we are serving members in new ways through our research programs. Let me say about just two new things we are doing within our existing health systems strategy program. First is our member collaborative focused on building the medical home. The medical home is a model of care in which hospitals work with primary care physicians to re-invigorate the delivery of critical preventive and chronic care services in the physician office setting. This model is a promising avenue for adopting changes in care delivery that over the longer-term will help with managing the overall health populations to better outcomes and lower costs. Working with primary care physicians to serve patients in this way is a change for hospitals, which have traditionally been focused on acute episodes of care. The medical home collaborative is working to establish medical home best practices, advance organizations in concrete measurable ways and share ongoing lessons learned in launching, refining and expanding the medical home model. These included within hospitals' regular membership on our health systems strategy program, and it's exciting to be working with the group of groundbreaking institutions on this topic. Second, we recently released an inpatient bundled payment impacts calculator. Again, part of our existing health system strategy program. This downloadable tool available to all members of our flagship research membership allows healthcare executives to model the financial implications of bundled payments that combine hospital and physician fees into a single lump sum reimbursement. Member reaction to the calculator has been outstanding. For example, last week, two system-level administrators from a 13 hospital system reviewed the tool with our research team before releasing it across their entire organization for hospital-specific analysis. They were highly complementary, praising its ease-of-use and the wealth of information it provides. These members are clearly not alone in their assessment, as more than 1,000 individuals downloaded that calculator for use in just the first week following its release. Of course, our best practice research work on physician alignment is complemented by our data analytics and performance management resources on this issue. For example, our Crimson Physician Management Performance program provides members detailed severity adjusted analytics of physician behavior, costs and outcomes through a visually intuitive interface. The web-based software application provides the critical visibility into clinical performance that enables true transformation of the way of care it delivered and it has been incredibly exciting to see the tangible positive impact that Crimson is having on care delivery. In one example, Jewish Hospital & St. Mary's Healthcare used Crimson to identify opportunities for postoperative anticoagulation management and other care improvements for cardiovascular surgery patients. By changing the way of care is delivers to such patients, Jewish & St. Mary's not only improve the quality of care, boosting overall core measure compliance, which is the key measure of quality by 28%, but also reduced the length of stay for cardiovascular surgery patients by 15%, eliminating more than 1,300 patient days for savings of approximately $350,000. In addition our enhanced capabilities and hospital physician integration and physician practice management through our Southwind Clinical Integration and Practice Management programs, provide members new support in working with physicians to provide more efficient and effective models of care. Our work here is also driving significant bottomline improvements for our members, including one large system in the Midwest that recently improved physician alignment through the Southwind engagement, reducing operating losses on employee practices by nearly $20 million. Finally, as we discussed in our last call, the changes in how hospitals work with physicians will require a new kind of information-powered care. In Q2, we have invested significantly to provide a groundbreaking support to our members. Both our long-standing IT strategy program and our newly launched Applications and Technologies Collaborative are producing outstanding insights here, and members are particularly excited about a 10-part web conference series of creating an IT blueprint for accountable care that we'll launch next week. Building on this set of market-leading capabilities in helping members address the current landscape, I'm pleased to announce today a new set of services to drive value for member hospitals as they seek to manage population health and find success in our new payment models. The launch of our employee health performance program. As hospitals look towards the future of bundled payments and increasingly assuming risks per patient outcomes outside the single episode of care, their recognizing a need for more data on and experience with broader management of the patient population in order to improve quality and cost outcomes. Because most hospitals and health systems are self-insured, and given that they control at least part of the network providing care of their employees, their own employee base are ready- made laboratory for gaining practice in the important scale of population health management. In fact, our research with the most progressive health systems has shown as the requisite first step towards establishing accountable care capabilities is demonstrating this ability to manage their own employee population, both in terms of clinical and financial outcomes. Only after demonstrating competence here have this progressive health systems been able to start selling payors, self-insured employers and physicians on the efficacy of their model. As the Vice President of a hospital in the put it, experience in this terrain is critical, so we are starting internally with our own self-insured employees. The employee health performance program provides hospitals and health systems a key component of the infrastructure necessary to improve care, while reducing waste and avoidable benefits costs for employee populations. Through best practice research, peer networking and access to a robust web-based software tool, the renewable program helps members increase appropriate care for their employees, resulting in improved outcomes, reduced overall costs of care and a strong track record to help succeed under new payment models that entail the assumption of additional risks. As with all of our launches, we have already established a strong charter membership for the program, including Yale New Haven Health System, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Scripps Health, Johns Hopkins Health System and Sutter Health. The program is off to a good start, and we are very excited about its potential. I also want to take this opportunity to provide a brief update on the exciting progress of our work serving the higher education market and to announce our latest program launch for this sector. Now, three years into our work serving institutions of higher learning, I'm pleased to report that we've built a scalable thriving practice, leveraging the lessons we learned from building our Healthcare business. With more than 300 members, our program is serving Provost, heads of student affairs and university business executives are performing well, even in a more difficult macroeconomic environment. And have attracted institutions ranging from elite private universities such as Brown, Wellesley, Dartmouth and Duke to a large public institutions such as Cal-Berkeley, University of Toronto, Ohio University, Texas Tech and Arizona State. Collectively, the programs take on 15 major research initiatives each year, complemented with more than 250 shorter reports for smaller audiences. Recent higher education meeting series included innovation in an era of uncertain funding, which is very well received by the membership, achieving an outstanding attendance and a GPA of 3.86. One presentation at the meeting, organizing continuing and professional education, offered models for pursuing scale and professional certificates and degree programs, while staying true to the institutional mission. The topic was really a call to action for many of our members, outlining the importance of developing a strategy to engage more broadly with the growing non- traditional student population. A Provost and one member institution, a well-known liberal arts university, commented at the Advisory Board meeting in Washington, ""It became clear to me that professional education is the area where the schools we compete with for the best students and scholars are going to be building war chests. If we don't do anything, we'll be the big disadvantage in 10 years' time."" As a result of our work, this Provost changed the agenda of her annual retreat with deans to focus on continuing the professional education strategy, and included the university's president in the meeting. Another of our higher education meetings, [ph] discipline in the decentralized university was also a hit with the GPAs of over 3.9. The overarching theme of the research was how university administrators could exert more influence on the type and quantity of goods purchased in organizations that are typically highly decentralized. The work focused on the best practice of shifting the procurement function away from its traditional compliance focus and more towards operating fast consultative customer service. One member used these principles to re-energize the previously stalled project aimed at standardizing print output devices saving them well over $100,000. Given these types of memory engagement, reaction and results, we are very excited about the trajectory of this growing membership. With our incredible team of researchers, outstanding members in gathering terrain knowledge, we are well-positioned to expand our impact on higher education institutions and to develop new launches and services to build our relationships going forward. In that context, I'm excited to announce today our new Community College Executive Program, our fourth program in the education space. This launch is particularly timely given the October 5, White House Summit on Community Colleges, which highlighted the importance of these institutions in preparing the company's future work force and enhancing U.S. competitiveness in the global economy. With more than 1,700 institutions across the country, community colleges comprise the largest part of the nation's higher education system. Further, community college enrollments stand at more than eight million students, and is growing rapidly due to the institution's ability to meet the needs of a broad student population through affordable tuition, open admission policies, flexible course schedules, convenient locations and online distance learning options. Yet, while the community college mission has perhaps never been more critical, these institutions face tremendous complexity. Record enrollments coupled with severe funding pressure create a host of challenges across community college finances, campus management, academic affairs and student services. The Community College Executive Program is a renewable research membership program that provides best practice research, peer networking and benchmarking tools to help community college presidents and their leadership teams address those key operational and strategic issues. The membership provides access to relevant research from across our education programs to meet the needs of community college leadership teams, which are definitionally smaller and more cross functional. With best practices on better managing financial operations, setting priorities in measuring and improving performance, the Community College Executive Program addresses the full portfolio of leadership challenges facing community college administrators. As always, we've established a strong charter membership for the program, including Houston Community College District, Northern Virginia Community College and Ivy Tech Community College System. These institutions are providing valuable input on program design, and we are excited to be working with them and our other charter members to build a successful program. Now let me turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in greater detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around five categories: Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2010. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that were on the March 31 fiscal year-end, which means we just finished the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. With the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 21.9% to $71.1 million, up from $58.3 million in the same period of the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share were $4.9 million and $0.30 for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, compared to adjusted net income of $4 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.26 for the same period a year ago. EBITDA was $9.4 million for the quarter compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $7.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. Adjusted results for the prior year, excluding pretax one-time charges of $7.4 million for the write-off capitalized developed software cost of $1.9 million of pre-[ph] compensation costs resulting from the cancellation of certain stock options. Including these expenses, for the three months ended September 30, 2009, GAAP net loss of $2.1 million or $0.14 per diluted share. Cost of services for the quarter was $36.9 million or 51.9% of revenue compared to $31 million or 53.2% of revenue in the same period of the prior-year. The increases in cost of services are primarily due to increased costs from new programs, including costs and amortization associated with our acquisition of the Southwind and Concuity. Also included in cost of services for the three months ended September 30, 2010, were $1 million of amortization related to acquisition, compared to $200,000 at the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of services decreased due to the scalability of incremental revenue inherent in our model. Member relations and marketing expense was $16.1 million or 22.6% of revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2010 compared to $13.1 million or 22.5% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior-year. We currently have 131 sales teams in place, an increase from the 111 sales teams for the quarter ended September 30, 2009. G&A expense increased to $9.7 million or 13.6% of revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2010, compared to $8.8 million or 15.1% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior-year, due primarily to an increase in talent recruitment expenses, as well as costs associated with two program launches in the quarter, increased investment in additional new product development costs and investment in our information systems infrastructure. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $1.4 million or 2% of revenue compared to $1.7 million or 2.9% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior-year. The decrease was primarily due to decreased amortization expense from developed capitalized internal-use software tools. Other income net in the quarter was $577,000 compared to $584,000 in the same period the prior year. This quarter's other income consisted of interest income of $406,000 and a gain of $171,000 from changes of foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. During the quarter ended September 30, 2009, we have interest income of $604,000 and a loss of $20,000 from changes[ph] in foreign exchange rates. Moving on to our six-month income statement results. For the six months ending September 30, 2010, revenue increased 19.8% to $137.8 million, up from $115 million last year. For the six months ending September 30, 2010, EBITDA, net income and earnings per diluted share were $19 million, $9.5 million and $0.59 respectively. Excluding one-time non-cash charges incurred in the September 2009, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the six months ending September 30, 2009 were $15 million, $8.2 million and $0.53 respectively. GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the six months ending September 30, 2009 were $2.1 million and $0.13. A reconciliation of the GAAP to adjusted results can be found in our press release. Turning to the balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables increased 18% to $148.3 million as of September 30, 2010, compared to $126.2 million as of September 30, 2009. DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables for 201 days in the quarter ended September 30, 2010, up slightly from 198 days as of September 30, 2009. Excluding the effects of progress billings, DSOs on billed AR were 50 days as of September 30, 2010, compared to 49 days as of September 30, 2009. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we've billed after 12 months increased to $216.2 million as of December 30, 2010, up 24.1% from $174.2 million as of September 30, 2009. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2010, was $186 million, up 30.4% over the prior-year. Looking at cash flow. During the three months ended September 30, 2010, we generated $13.1 million of cash from operating activities compared to $11.4 million generated at the same quarter last year. The six months ending September 30, 2010, cash flow generated from operations was $9 million compared to $8.8 million in the same period last year. For calendar year, 2010, we expect cash flow from operations to be at the high-end of our historical range of 1.5x to 2x net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending September 30, 2010, were approximately $2 million compared to $400,000 for the three months ending September 30, 2009. This increase is due to increased levels of capitalized expenditures associated with our analytical tools programs this year when compared to the same period the prior year. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures, was $12.8 million in the quarter ending September 30, 2010, up from $11 million in the same quarter of the prior year. For the three months ending September 30, 2010, we repurchased $2.5 million of stock or approximately 59,000 shares. This brings our total repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $312.5 million or approximately 7.4 million shares. As of September 30, 2010, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $37.5 million. As of September 30, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were $86.9 million, representing approximately $5.33 per share. As to contract value, contract value increased 19.8% to $284.7 million as of September 30, 2010, up from $237.6 million as of September 30, 2009. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time, without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with more than 12 months duration, we only include 12 months of contract value. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar 2010, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions, which are subject to change over time. We're updating our calendar 2010 revenue growth guidance to be at least 17% growth over calendar 2009. We expect calendar 2010 adjusted EBITDA, which excludes costs associated with the Concuity acquisition that were incurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2010, in the range of approximately $38 million to $40 million. And non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $1.22 to $1.28. For the remainder of the calendar year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35 1/2% to 36 1/2%. This concludes the financial summary, I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. As we enter our biggest commercial period of the year in both sales and renewals, I can say with confidence that the entire organization is singularly focused on finishing this year strong to set up another successful year in 2011. We have three-key priorities to achieve these goals. First, flawless execution in Q4, that's calendar Q4. Across all areas of the business, particularly sales, marketing and account management, our employees know the importance of performing to the highest standard of this busy time of the year. With 131 sales teams in seat, we are actively managing every pursuit and our innovations in capturing and codifying information from member touch points, ensure that we are doing so intelligently and in the most leveraged way possible. Our account management team is also firing in all cylinders, cultivating relationships, providing world- class service and demonstrating program value to ensure that members renew their participation in our programs and extend their relationships with us. With sales and renewal teams have benefited from their continued outstanding work by our strategic marketing team, which has resulted in an expanded ability to reach our members with messages about our new products and services, as well as an increase in inbound interest in product leads. Of course, success in all these functions is fed by the consistently superior value our members receive each day from their memberships. And delivering strong value to members is a top priority for our product teams across all divisions of the firm. Our second priority is continuing to position ourselves to capture the unique opportunities in today's environment. With two launches this quarter and a total of four launches across the last three quarters, we've been more aggressive on our launch schedule, and we continue to believe that it is important to invest in a timely way to make sure that we are taking advantage of the market opportunities we see before us. The broader industry changes have created tremendous needs across the membership and we are uniquely well-suited to serve these needs in valuable ways with new programs and services. Pulling these new product development investments ahead into this year, gets us out into the market sooner, and will provide additional momentum and revenue visibility as we move into 2011. In addition, our Business Development teams continue to screen dozens of companies for partnership and acquisition opportunities, and while it's always hard to know when a deal will come through, we continue to feel that across the next 18 months, one to two acquisitions or partnerships are likely. As I've said before, we expect to continue launching four to five new programs per year to help our members address their challenges -- and I'm confident that our ongoing focus on this area will continue to be a successful component of our business and growth strategy. Just as our 2009 new products and business development investments have paid off with strong top and bottom line growth in 2010, our current launches and activity will have the same effects in 2011 and beyond. Finally as always, we continue to invest in attracting, engaging, developing and retaining world-class talent at all levels of the organization. As I look back across the past year, the company's growth trajectory has created a stimulating environment for employees at all levels of the firm. Not only does our growth reflect the continuing and increasing value we are delivering to our members about which our employees are passionate, but our growth also necessitates the creation of new clear opportunities for individuals across the company, as we create new programs, new positions and new leadership roles and move staff to fill those, as well as back fill those moves with other staff. In a growth environment, each employee has the opportunity to live on the steep part of the curve, experiencing tremendous learning, exciting opportunity and robust professional development. As we have expanded, we have also made some strong new hires, bringing in new types of talents to the firm to complement our tremendous reserve of talent. I continue to be extremely impressed with the engagement, commitment and energy of our employees at all levels, and I am enormously proud to have such a high caliber team working each day with our members to drive performance improvement and tangible impact. Perhaps, above all else, our talent gives me a great confidence in how we will perform next year and into the future. Thank you for participating in tonight's call. We will now turn it over to your questions."

At this time, I would turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musselwhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you and good evening. I'm Robert Musselwhite, CEO of the Advisory Board. I'm joined today by Michael Kirschbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, covering our financial results, new program launch, investment in Evolent Health, and a discussion of some of the key drivers of our performance. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our top operational and strategic priorities heading into the close of the calendar year. As always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended September 30, 2011, Advisory Board revenue increased 30.7% to $92.9 million from $71.1 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2010. Contract value grew 29.7% to $369.1 million as of September 30, 2011, up from $284.7 million as of September 30, 2010. For the quarter ended September 30, 2011, net income was $5.2 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. For the quarter ended September 30, 2011, adjusted net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $9.7 million, $0.56 per diluted share, and $17.2 million, respectively, compared with $7.1 million, $0.44 per diluted share, and $12.1 million for the same quarter last year. We are very pleased with our strong performance for the quarter which again underscores that in these times of unprecedented change in the healthcare industry, members consistently turn to the Advisory Board for comprehensive solutions to their most pressing challenges. It is extremely gratifying that our investments in expanding our capabilities to meet members' needs are yielding outstanding product quality as well as deeper, more impactful relationships. With both revenue and contract value growth of 30%, our strong financial results this quarter reflect the success of our strategy and position us well going forward. Given our rapid growth this quarter and the visibility inherent in our model, we are pleased to be able to revise our outlook, increasing our revenue projections to a range of $349 million to $352 million and our adjusted EBITDA range to $61.5 million to $64.5 million for calendar year 2011. The growth we are seeing is the direct result of work we have done over the last several years both to keep pace with our members' needs in a changing market and to capitalize on this unique environment. We've done this by innovating within our existing programs and also by developing meaningful new programs and services to extend our portfolio. Across the board, we have held ourselves to the highest bar for delivering critical insights and must-have data and analytics in the midst of tremendous complexity, remaining agile in responding to new developments in the market and consistently driving member value and impact. Our membership body itself is a key tool in our ability to do each of those things, as we use our hundreds of daily interactions with health system executives to understand more deeply the dynamics of the market, executives' keep-you-up-at-night issues, and the solutions and insights that will best help them solve their most important strategic and operational issues. Today, of course, the top set of issues continues to be around the movement towards value-based care. As a wide variety of external factors including population changes, increasing cost pressures, and federal and state legislation creates imperatives to improve both care quality and operational efficiency. Health systems must navigate a transitional period where they must meet the dual goals of performing well under current largely volume-based reimbursement systems while also preparing for upcoming shifts in financing models that will emphasize value. In our research and -- excuse me. In our Research and Insights Membership programs, this has, of course, been the focus of our work for the better part of the last two years. Both this summer's Chief Executive Roundtables, which I spoke about in our last call, and our Health System Strategy Programs Flagship Meeting Series, which just launched in September focused on the key imperatives for success in the new value-based environment. Our research suggests that only by pulling a variety of levers, cost control, efficiency gains, revenue capture and care management will help systems be able to break even on Medicare-level pricing and maintain long-term financial viability. At the heart of these efforts will be the development of the essential infrastructure for delivering accountable care focused on empowering clinicians with information and developing a strong and sustainable physician enterprise. Our two-day Health System Strategy Flagship Meeting addresses these challenges in turn, focusing first on public payers, Medicare and Medicaid, and then on the foundational requirements for delivering accountable care, including leveraging data and managing physician networks. The meeting series just recently launched, and with over 2,500 people already registered to attend one of the sessions over the next several months, it is proving to be exactly on point in delivering the insight our members need on these complex topics. Of course, there's never a dull moment for our Research and Insights teams, and no sooner did they launch the meeting series, but CMS issued its final rule on its shared savings program or its Accountable Care Program. As always, our teams did an outstanding job digesting the lengthy rule and distilling it down to seven key implications for our membership. These insights were delivered immediately following the rules issuance via thought piece in our daily news briefing and a blockbuster teleconference with a panel of six of our experts. They were also then sent back into the content of the flagship meeting series. Our members consistently cite this type of agility and responsiveness to key market changes as the reason why the Advisory Board is their most trusted partner in developing and executing strategy in this complex market. Another recent innovation on this front is our Health System Strategy programs recently released Total Value of Care Dashboard, because health system leaders will continue to find themselves managing against the mix of volume and value-based incentives for the foreseeable future. They must pace investments in care transformation with real change in payment. The Total Value of Care Dashboard is an innovative new tool to help executive management measure and track results along multiple dimensions of performance: the sustainability of their business model, their reliability of their clinical model, and the impact their services have on the health of the populations they serve. The dashboard highlights relative areas of strength and emerging performance improvement opportunities along all three dimensions of care to validate or amend the system's current strategy for managing the transition to a more accountable payment environment. These innovations in our Research and Insights programs complement the extensive work we have done to introduce new programs and services to support members with all of their critical needs during this time of complexity. During our CEO meeting series this summer, I had the occasion to speak with groups of our member CEOs about the broader capabilities the Advisory Board can now offer, such as our extensive suite of software-based programs and our deep position practice management services, and the responses were very gratifying. One member CEO wrote me a note saying, ""I'm witnessing a very different Advisory Board over the last several years than I previously experienced. The services are more comprehensive and timely, and I find them essential to our thought and focus for the future. Thank you."" It is exciting to hear health system CEOs respond in this way to our broadening portfolio, and we continue to focus on developing new and innovative ways to meet their needs. Given that, I'm also pleased to announce today our launch of the Crimson Market Advantage Program, which builds on our 500- member strong Crimson platform to provide hospitals and health systems actionable data to improve their physician outreach efforts with the aim of enhancing physician referrals. In a market where competition for profitable procedures has increased, hospitals recognize that even minor volume declines can have a big impact on revenue. Yet, most organizations have little visibility into the very referral patterns in their markets that determine growth, and in fact are often unable to answer such critical questions to as: are we capturing key referrals in our market? How can I segment the referring physician community to discover missed growth opportunities? And what is the best approach to enhance referral to my organization? Analysis performance at our current member hospitals suggests that most organizations have a referral network that could be up to 30% larger. Crimson Market Advantage provides technology, expertise and staff to help hospitals develop efficient, targeted physician outreach efforts to identify and understand better the referring physicians in their markets in order to uncover potential sources of growth. The program is off to a strong start and we are confident in the value it will provide to our members. Before I turn things over to Michael, I also wanted to talk about our recent investment along with UPMC health plan in Evolent Health, an independent company supporting health systems in their migration toward value-based care models. Evolent Health offers an integrated population management technology platform, extensive operational care management support, back-office payer functions, and holistic change management support, all designed to support integrated delivery systems and other providers in their preparation to accept and manage all forms of value-based care reimbursement. Given the transformative change facing our healthcare system, it is clear that hospitals and health systems must build new capabilities for managing under new payment incentives and delivering better care more efficiently. This imperative has been the guiding force behind our building out the most innovative and comprehensive set of new solutions for hospitals and health systems across the past four years, including our market- leading Crimson performance management platform, Southwind physician alignment and management services, and contract modeling capabilities through our acquisition of Concuity. In that same spirit, we decided to invest with UPMC in Evolent Health. UPMC has 15 years of experience in successfully building integrated payer provider models as the second largest provider on health plan in the country after Kaiser. Their innovative population management technology has proven to generate higher- quality, lower-cost care, and Evolent Health will provide an avenue to bring these capabilities and its track record of success to other health systems across the nation. We are excited to participate in this new venture with UPMC and we are confident that Evolent Health will provide hospitals and health systems significant value through shared access to uniquely effective set of population health management capabilities. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around five categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and the outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2011. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on a March 31 fiscal yearend, which means we just finished the second quarter of fiscal year 2012. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 30.7% to $92.9 million, up from $71.1 million in the same period the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending September 30, 2011 increased 42% to $17.2 million, up from $12.1 million in the same period the prior year. Adjusted net income was $9.7 million compared to $7.1 million last year, and non- GAAP earnings per share was $0.56 compared to $0.44 last year. These adjusted numbers for the quarters ended September 30, 2011 and '10 exclude acquisition and transaction-related costs and amortization as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including these acquisition and transaction-related costs and amortization, as well as share-based compensation expense, GAAP net income and income per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 were $5.2 million and $0.30, respectively. Cost of services increased to $52.5 million or 56.5% of revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2011 compared to $36.9 million or 51.9% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. Included in cost of services for the quarter ending September 30, 2011 is a $2.6 million share value adjustment to our Southwind acquisition related earn-out liability, resulting from strong business performance, appreciation of Advisory Board shares that are part of the consideration and adjustments to the acquisition of PivotHealth. The remaining increase in cost of services are due to increased expenses for new and growing programs, primarily related to our Crimson platform and Southwind, as well as newly-incorporated costs. Member relations and marketing expense was $18.5 million or 19.9% of revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2011 compared to $16.1 million or 22% -- 20.6% of revenue in the same quarter last year. We currently have 145 sales teams in place. It increased from the 131 sales teams in place in the quarter ending September 30, 2010. G&A expense for the quarter increased to $11.9 million or 12.8% of revenue compared to $9.7 million or 13.6% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year, due primarily to an increase in new product development costs as well as an increase in personnel costs and infrastructure investments in our IT and finance functions to support our growing employee base. Also included in G&A expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 were costs of $504,000 relating to our recently announced transactions. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $2.1 million or 2.3% of revenue compared to $1.4 million or 2% of revenue in the same quarter last year, due to increased amortization from capital investments in our growing technology platforms -- programs. Other income net in the quarter was $448,000 compared to $577,000 in the same period the prior year. This quarter's other income consists of interest income of $556,000 and a loss of $108,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, we had interest income of $406,000 and a gain of $171,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to our fiscal year-to-date income statement results, for the six months ending September 30, 2011, revenue increased 26.7% to $174.5 million, up from $137.8 million last year. GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the six months ending September 30, 2011 was $9.1 million or $0.63, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $31.7 million, $18.1 million, and $1.06, respectively for the six months ending September 30, 2011, compared to $24.4 million, $14.3 million, and $0.89, respectively, for the same period in the previous fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivable, increased to $234.5 million as of September 30, 2011 compared to $148.3 million as of September 30, 2010. Gross DSOs which we calculate using [added] receivables were 212 days in the quarter ending September 30, 2011, and were [201] days as of September 30, 2010. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs [on billed AR] were 45 days at September 30, 2011, down from 50 days at September 30, 2010 due to improved collections. Deferred revenue net of amounts that we've billed after 12 months increased to $329.5 million as of September 30, 2011, up from $216.2 million as of September 30, 2010. Excluding long-term preferred prepaid contracts and deferred revenue acquired from PivotHealth, the deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2011 was $256 million, up 37% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ending September 30, 2011, our cash generated from operating activities was $32.4 million compared to $13.1 million in the same quarter last year. For the six months ending September 30, 2011, cash flow generated from operations was $37 million, up from $9 million in the prior fiscal year. Calendar year to date, we generated cash flow from operations of 2.1x adjusted net income compared to 1.3x adjusted income for the same period last year, and are trending ahead of our historical 1.5 to 2x range. Capital expenditures for the three months ending September 30, 2011 were approximately $8.4 million compared to $2 million for the three months ending September 30, 2010. This increase is due to increased levels of investment associated with [analytical tools] program this year, as well $3.1 million of expenditures related to the buildup of additional floors at both our Washington, D.C. and Austin, Texas office spaces. For the three months ending September 30, 2011, we purchased $2.4 million of stock, approximately 40,000 shares, which brings our total share repurchased since the inception of program in 2004 to $321 million for approximately 7.6 million shares. As of September 30, 2011, the remaining authorized repurchase, $29 million. As Robert mentioned, during the quarter we invested $10 million along with other non-cash contributions into Evolent Health for initial equity interest of approximately 44%. We expect to record our percentage of any income or loss from Evolent Health in the other income net line on our income statement. We anticipate this impact to be approximately $300,000 of expense before taxes for the remainder of calendar 2011, recording other income net which is excluded from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA and non- GAAP earnings per diluted share. As of September 30, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $121.7 million, representing approximately $7 per diluted share. At the contract value, contract value increased 29.7% to $369.1 million as of September 30, 2011, up from $284.7 million as of September 30, 2011. We defined contract value, the annualized revenue attributable to all agreements (inaudible) point in time, without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts of more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar 2011, the following comments are intended to fall into the Safe Harbor Provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. We are increasing our revenue guidance for calendar 2011 to a range of approximately $349 million to $352 million, up from the previous range of $342 million to $349 million. We're also increasing our guidance for calendar 2011 adjusted EBITDA to range at $61.5 million to $64.5 million, up from the previous range of $60 million to $64 million, and are increasing our guidance for calendar 2011 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to range approximately $2.08 to $2.17, up from the previous range of $2.06 to $2.13.As with prior year, we intend to make investments in the December quarter to [support] expenses that set up the business for strong start to calendar 2012. For calendar 2011, we continue to expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $10 million and amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets to be approximately $5 million. For the remainder of calendar 2011, we expect an effective tax rate of roughly 37.5%.This concludes the financial summary, I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. As we enter the fourth quarter -- sorry, as we enter the fourth calendar quarter of the year, a critical time for both sales and renewals, I can say with confidence that the entire organization is singularly focused on finishing this year well and set up another successful year in 2012. We obviously entered this period with a great deal of momentum across the business and we remain focused on our four key priorities to ensure strong execution on our goals. As always, our first priority is ensuring continued outstanding value delivery to members. As we kick off our flagship meeting series, we are more than ever reminded of our responsibility to members in these complex times. Across our Research and Insights programs, our software programs and our management and consulting services, all staff members are more focused than ever on delivering innovation, excellent service and real impact to our members. As our market experience has tremendous change and transformation, this drive will continue to be critical to our success. Second, we will continue to invest in new product development efforts in order to capture the unique opportunities presented by current market conditions. Our launch of the Crimson Market Advantage program is an example of our ongoing focus on expanding our portfolio to serve hospitals and health systems more deeply and meaningfully. We continue to emphasize forward-thinking organic new product development as well as strategy acquisitions to drive greater member impact and value and to capitalize on the opportunities before us in today's market. Our strong results this quarter make us even more confident in the strength of this strategy, and we will continue this formula going forward. Third, we will continue to ensure we execute at a high standard across the firm. In this important period for both sales and renewals, we are leveraging the momentum and energy our outstanding performance this year has provided, while also continuing to emphasize the discipline, hard work and attention to detail required for ongoing success. Each function within the firm has in place an action plan to ensure that the outstanding performance continues without letting up. Our work at this time of the year is critical to setting up for 2012 and beyond, and I'm confident that we have in place the right tools to continue to achieve our goals. Finally, cultivating world-class talent at all levels of the organization remains a top priority. In a time where we are growing rapidly, talent is critical to our success. Given that, it is fantastic that as we create new programs and serve our growing membership, we are also building an incredibly exciting environment for talent. We are adding new positions, establishing new leadership roles, moving staff to fill them, and also backfilling those moves with the next group of up-and-coming staff as they develop. We are also investing in developing skills in our employees at all levels of the firm to prepare them for the new opportunities afforded by our growth. Finally, we are bringing key hires with new skill sets to continue to build on our capabilities and deepen our leadership bench. We held our annual firm-wide meeting on Friday, and it was my great privilege to address our 1,600 employees around the world, many joining us via webcast from remote offices. I continue to be extremely impressed with the capabilities, engagement, commitment and energy of our employees at all levels, and I'm enormously proud to have such a high-caliber team working each day with our members to drive performance improvement and tangible impact. Perhaps above all else, it is clear that our talent will continue to be a pillar of our strength going forward. Thank you for participating in tonight's call. We will now turn it over to your questions."

I’m Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I’m joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. First off, our thoughts are with our members, employees, investors and analysts who have been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. For all of you participating this evening, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and that recovery from the storm proceeds quickly. We have a 3-part agenda for this evening’s call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, covering our financial results, a discussion of some of the key drivers of our performance and our acquisition of ActiveStrategy. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our top operational and strategic priorities heading into the close of the calendar year. As always, we'll will be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended September 30, 2012, Advisory Board revenue increased 21.1% to $110.8 million from $91.5 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2011. Contract value grew 19.7% to $435.1 million as of September 30, 2012, up from $363.6 million as of September 30, 2011. For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, net income was $7.5 million or $0.21 per diluted share compared to net income of $5.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, adjusted net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $11.4 million, $0.31 per diluted share and $20.8 million, respectively, compared with $9.6 million, $0.28 per diluted share and $16.9 million for the same quarter last year. We're pleased with our performance for the quarter and our deepening ability to support our members as they face ongoing change and complexity in their markets. It is very gratifying that our members consistently turn to the Advisory Board for comprehensive solutions to their most pressing challenges. We take their trust very seriously and are constantly innovating to ensure that we continue to meet their needs effectively and efficiently. Right now, hospitals and health systems face 2 distinct but complementary challenges to their business models. On the one hand, demographic and economic pressures are squeezing margins as more and more patients fall onto the publicly insured roles and the volumes of commercially-covered patients continue to stagnate. On the other, health care purchasers, payers, employers and patients are increasingly demanding new care models that lower costs while improving outcomes. Providers that successfully deliver lower-cost, higher-quality care across the care continuum and have developed new contacts and payment structures that reap rewards from this higher value care are best positioned under these new demands. It is clear that for many, if not most, providers, reducing the total cost of care for purchasers will lead to accepting population health risk in some form. For those organizations, the challenge is to improve health outcomes, while at the same time reducing preventable utilization of services. This requires the hospital to develop a host of new capabilities. They will need to have the data to understand the total avoidable cost opportunity across the population of patients, as well as the interventions that prevent the costliest utilization types. In addition, they will need skills in physician training and change management as they guide physicians to think about providing care in a different way. They will also need an efficient care management enterprise capable of managing patient health across multiple sites of care. This will include having systems that can link data across the continuum from inpatient to subacute care to outpatient treatment facilities. The national meeting series of our flagship program for health system CEOs focuses on this set of topics, and the reaction from members thus far has been tremendous, with over 2,300 people currently registered to attend the in-person sessions over the coming weeks and several times that number who access the content in a variety of other ways as we push out the research through our website, teleconferences and on-site presentations. The series launched 2 weeks ago with the first session in our offices and over 90% of attending executives ranked the keynote presentation on the future of care management as excellent. The meeting featured insights gleaned from 2 important initiatives we have been running as part of this flagship membership program: our Medicare Breakeven Initiative and our Care Transformation Center. Our Medicare Breakeven Initiative is a peer working group for providers looking to strengthen margins in the face of demographic, pricing, cost and case mix pressures. Supported by Advisory Board staff, the project offers ongoing guidance to hospitals and health systems preparing inpatient operations for the challenges of a market characterized by ever greater reliance on publicly insured volumes. The initiative has gotten great traction since we introduced it several months ago. We received very strong feedback on the initiative's resources, which include an in-depth research study on running on Medicare margins, as well as performance improvement best practices on bending the expense growth curve, achieving full revenue capture, expanding effective capacity and managing case mix. The initiative also includes several data tools that members are using to help improve their performance, including our cost reduction opportunity assessment, Medicare financial benchmark generator and total margin scenario planner. The capstone of the project is the margin improvement intensive, which combines scenarios for key financial and operational metrics customized for the specific institution with a facilitated on-site session and an institution-specific action plan to help hospitals and health systems prepare for ever greater reliance on publicly insured volume. The Medicare Breakeven Initiative has been one of the most successful research initiatives in our history, reaching nearly 30,000 individuals and achieving unprecedented levels of member engagement. We've been tremendously pleased with the way the project is allowing us to deepen our relationships. For example, a large multistate health system in the West has been a very enthusiastic participant. Through the project, we've worked with them to analyze long-term margin trends for each of their acute care facilities, providing a performance improvement action plan for the system, its separate regions and each individual hospital. The analyses presented to the system's executive leadership have become the backbone of the organization's long-term plans for margin sustainability in the face of decelerating reimbursement from payers. More recently, we have paired the initiative with our Crimson performance improvement platform to show members where they have discrete opportunities for streamlining operations and minimizing costly clinical variation, providing a sophisticated and detailed plan for containing cost creep, the single biggest margin challenge hospitals and health systems currently face. Member feedback has been outstanding. The CFO of a hospital in the East commented, ""You all understand and are able to eloquently teach something I've been unsuccessfully trying to say for 2 years now. The long-term margin problems we face as an the industry are structural. They won't be solved just by cutting staff or opening a new surgery center. You provided us the right roadmap for getting beyond that."" While our Medicare Breakeven Initiative is focused on redesigning inpatient care, our newly launched Care Transformation Center is focused on transforming patient care across the continuum. The drive toward integrated and value-based health care requires providers both to revise organizational structures that were created for fee-for-service medicine and to broaden capabilities outside the 4 walls of a hospital through either direct ownership of or strategic partnership with other care providers. Increasingly, there's been an emergence of a new executive responsible for enacting this transition and for doing so quickly, efficiently and with minimal disruption. It's a daunting task indeed and one for which there exists no clear roadmap. The Care Transformation Center serves these Chief Transformation Officers and provides them with the means of accessing their peers to share ideas, challenges and innovations as they move from high-level planning of systems for delivering value-based care to their implementation. The Care Transformation Center is helping drive forward the transition to value-based care by arming decision-makers with the knowledge and data necessary to shape and inform their implementation initiatives. The center's work is focusing on new major research trains specific to care transformation, including topics like constructing the care continuum and managing at-risk contracts. The center's transformation blueprint reports cover the nitty-gritty of transformation, things like case management, remote monitoring and care standardization. Perhaps most exciting to our members are the peer-to-peer summits for idea generation, best practice sharing and networking. The first of these is coming up this month, and we are very excited to convene these group of executives who are so critical to the evolution of our industry going forward. As we speak with our members, particularly the executives focused on the transformation to value- based care, they're sharing that an area of increasing focus for them is patient experience. This is for very practical reasons. It is increasingly a factor in provider reimbursements. For example, in Blue Cross of Massachusetts Alternative Quality Contract Program, patient experience accounts for 25% of incentive payments. And in Medicare's Value-based Purchasing Program, it accounts for 30%. Given the general movement in this direction, it is not surprising that a recent industry survey showed that 85% of respondents are making patient experience investments. Members know the series is important and yet they express numerous frustrations with the most prevalent systems for uncovering data to help with these efforts. Traditional solutions are failing to get at the root causes of underperformance. Most are paper-based, requiring manual work from nurses and making it difficult to build a comprehensive picture of patient service problems. In addition, because of the manual processes, data typically lags, meaning that by the time the data is received, the window of opportunity for improving the experience of the individual patient has often closed because the patient has been discharged. Finally, driving systemic recovery efforts from these manual systems is challenging, requiring a huge investment of time and tracking and enforcing accountability. In this context, I am pleased to announce our acquisition of ActiveStrategy, a performance improvement technology and consulting firm with unmatched solutions for tracking and enhancing organizational effectiveness. Of particular excitement for us is ActiveStrategy's iRound platform, which brings a distinctive and valuable solution to health care providers. It combines mobile collection of behavioral and observational data with realtime point-of-care service recovery capabilities. Used in a provider setting, this approach to managing patient experience addresses the key shortcoming of traditional survey methodologies by empowering front-line staff to respond immediately to unmet patient needs. iRound's analytics also feed into executive dashboards that display unit level insights on performance and highlight major gaps in service quality. Founded by executives who are organizational effectiveness experts, ActiveStrategy helps dozens of institutions to achieve state and national recognition for performance excellence, including the prestigious Baldrige Award. The Philadelphia-based company currently works with some of the most progressive health care providers, including Kaiser Permanente, Adventist Health and Aria Health. The clients are achieving outstanding results, with one client seeing patient experience scores increase by more than 20% as a direct result of their use of the iRound technology. As providers are increasingly held accountable for quality and patient experience, the ActiveStrategy acquisition represents a great opportunity to enhance our support of members in driving patient engagement outcomes and improving their own financial performance under value-based reimbursement structures. We anticipate building a new program around the technology over the coming months and are also very excited to have technology that's right for the next-generation products. We look forward to enhancing our supportive members transitioning to value-based care through these new capabilities. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around 6 categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, the acquisition of ActiveStrategy and finally, our outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2012. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Please also note that all prior period earnings per share numbers have been adjusted to reflect our 2 for 1 stock split that was effective on June 18th of this year. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 21.1% to $110.8 million, up from $91.5 million in the same quarter of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending September 30, 2012, increased 23% to $20.8 million, up from $16.9 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted net income was $11.4 million compared to $9.6 million last year, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.31 compared to $0.28 last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarter ending September 30, 2012, and 2011 exclude transaction-related costs to amortization, loss on investment in common stock warrants, equity in loss of consolidated entity, as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including these transaction-related costs to amortization, loss on investment in common stock warrants, equity and income of consolidated entity and share-based compensation expense, GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, were $7.5 million and $0.21, respectively. Before discussing the rest of the income statement, I want to remind everyone of the change in the way we're reporting our cost of services that I mentioned last quarter. Prior to this fiscal year, our cost of service line included amortization, specifically with our software development, and our previous acquisitions. Starting in fiscal year 2013, we've consolidated all of our amortization into the depreciation amortization line in the income statement. We believe this change will simplify the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results and provide a more accurate view of our cost of services. We've adjusted all prior period announcements for consistency. Cost of services, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased to $57 million or 51.5% of revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2012, compared to $49.8 million or 54.4% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increases in cost of services are due to increased expenses for new and growing programs, primarily related to our physician products, as well as expenses from our acquisition of PivotHealth in August 2011. Also included in cost of services for the 3 months ending September 30, 2011, was $2.3 million of fair value adjustments to our various acquisition-related earn-out liabilities and there are no such fair value adjustments this year. Member relations and marketing expense were $21.5 million or 19.4% of revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2012, compared to $18.5 million or 20.2% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. We currently have 167 sales teams in place compared to 145 sales teams in place at the end of the quarter, September 30, 2011. G&A expense increased to $15.6 million or 14.1% of revenue in the quarter ended September 30, 2012, compared to $11.9 million or 13% revenue in the same quarter of the prior year, due primarily to an increase in personnel costs, infrastructure and investment in our IT, HR, legal and finance function to support our growing employee base, as well as approximately $600,000 of nonrecurring external costs related to our new credit facility and the acquisition of ActiveStrategy. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter includes the amounts that were previously recorded cost of services was $4.4 million or 4% of revenue compared to $3.5 million or 3.8% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year due to increased amortization from capital investments in our growing technology programs, the Pivot acquisition in August 2011, as well as additional depreciation from leasehold improvements relating to expansion space in our Austin and Washington, D.C. offices. Other income net in the quarter was $688,000 compared to $448,000 in the same period of the prior year. This quarter's other income consists of interest income of $858,000, plus a gain of $32,000 from change in foreign currency exchange rates reflecting our receivables from international members, netted against $90,000 of amortized credit facility origination fees and $110,000 of fair value loss or investment in common stock warrants. During the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we had interest income of $556,000 and a loss of $108,000 in changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to our fiscal year-to-date income statement results. For the 6 months ending September 30, 2012, revenue increased 25.4% to $214.9 million, up from $171.4 million last year. GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the 6 months ending September 30, 2012, were $11.3 million and $0.31, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $40.9 million, $22.5 million and $0.62, respectively, for the 6 months ending September 30, 2012, as compared to $31.1 million, $17.9 million and $0.53, respectively, for the same period the previous year. Turning to the balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased to $319.2 million as of September 30, 2012, compared to $234.5 million as of September 30, 2011. Excluding the effect of progress payments, DSOs on billed AR were 53 days as of September 30, 2012, compared to 45 days as of September 30, 2011, and 56 days as of March 31, 2012. Deferred revenue net of amounts that we've billed after 12 months, increased to $450.1 million as of September 30, 2012, up from $329.5 million as of September 30, 2011. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2012, were $359.7 million, up 34.8% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the 3 months ended September 30, 2012, our cash generated from operating activities was $43.7 million compared to $32.4 million in the same quarter last year. For the 6 months ending September 30, 2012, cash flow generated from operations was $42.1 million, up from $37 million in the prior fiscal year. Calendar year-to-date, we've generated cash flow from operations of 2x adjusted income and are trending fully ahead of our historical 1.5 to 2.5x adjusted net income range. Capital expenditures for the 3 months ending September 30, 2012, were approximately $7.8 million compared to $8.4 million for the 3 months ending September 30, 2011. For the 3 months ending September 30, 2012, we repurchased $5 million of stock or approximately 114,000 shares. This means our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $331 million or 15.4 million shares. As of September 30, 2012, the remaining authorized share repurchase amount was $19 million. As of September 30, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance were approximately $227.8 million, representing approximately $6.28 per diluted share. As to contract value, contract value increased 19.7% to $435.1 million as of September 30, 2012, up from $363.6 million as of September 30, 2011. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with more than 12-month duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. Turning to ActiveStrategy. The company has also announced that we have purchased ActiveStrategy,  the Philadelphia-based performance improvement technology and consulting firm. The purchase price is approximately $15 million. We expect the ActiveStrategy acquisition to contribute less than $1 million in incremental revenue in December quarter for calendar 2012, with expected adjusted EBITDA dilution of approximately $1 million for the remainder of calendar year 2012. For calendar 2013, we expect EBITDA dilution in the range of approximately $3 million to $4 million. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2012, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions, which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2012, we are updating our revenue guidance to be in the range of approximately $428 million to $432 million, up from $426 million to $432 million previously. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of approximately $79 million to $82 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $1.20 to $1.25. This guidance includes the dilutive effect of ActiveStrategy noted earlier. For calendar 2012, we expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $14 million and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets to be approximately $5 million. For calendar 2012, we expect an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 38% to 38.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. The fourth calendar quarter of the year is always an important one for our business, with 40% of sales and renewals happening during this period. Given that our entire organization is singularly focused on outstanding execution during this time to continue our strong performance and set us up well for the coming year, we remain focused on 4 key priorities to meet our goals. As always, our first priority is ensuring continued outstanding value delivery to members. With over 2,300 member executives already signed up for our flagship meeting series, we are more than ever reminded of our responsibility to members in these complex times. Across our research and insight programs, our software programs and our management and consulting services, all staff members are focused on delivering innovation, providing outstanding service and documenting member value creation from our programs. This focus on a member value is critical to both our trust and position with the executives we serve and our ability to continue to grow our business to meet expanding member needs. Second, we will continue to invest in new product development efforts in order to capture the unique opportunities presented by current market conditions. Our ActiveStrategy acquisition is an example of our ongoing work to expand our portfolio to serve members in new ways. We continue to emphasize forward-thinking new product development through both strategic acquisitions and organic new product development. These are critical to drive greater member impact and value, as well as to capitalize on today's unique market. Our track record provides us confidence in the importance of this strategy, and we will continue this formula going forward. Third, we will continue to ensure we execute at a high standard across the firm. In this important time for both sales and renewals, we continue to emphasize the discipline, hard work and attention to detail required across the firm in order to continue our track record of success. In particular, strong execution in sales, marketing and renewals will be very important to set up next year, yielding the revenue to invest in the future while also delivering bottom line expansion. Our commercial teams are fully resourced and have at their disposal both the tools and deep member intelligence they need to perform well this quarter. I'm confident that we have in place the right plan, talent and tools to continue to achieve our goals. Finally, cultivating world-class talent in all levels of the organization remains a top priority. The talent imperative is perhaps the most important one for all of us in this time of growth. I'm proud that we invested here, not only increasing headcount, with the addition of approximately 1,000 physicians over the last 3 years, but investing in leadership, nearly tripling our management capacity and providing tremendous career path opportunities for our talented staff. We are committed to our ongoing initiatives to strengthen our talent base, including robust training and development, accelerated programs for exceptional performers and our women's leadership group. With the highest retention rates and engagement scores in our history, I'm confident that our talent base will differentiate us into the future, and I'm excited to work with this tremendous team to continue to build on the Advisory Board Company's success. Thank you for participating in tonight's call. We will now turn it over to your questions."
178,GV_145042_2009Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advisory Board Company’s third quarter earnings conference call. As a reminder this conference call is being recorded. Your host for the call today is Mr. Frank Williams, Executive Chairman of The Advisory Board Company. This call will be archived and available from 8 p.m. this evening until 8 p.m. on February 16th via web cast on the company’s web site in the section entitled The Firm found under tab Investor Relations. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements among other regarding the advisory board company’s expected quarterly and annual financial performance for fiscal 2009. For this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements without limiting the foregoing discussions of forecasts, estimates, targets, plans, beliefs, expectations, and the like are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You are hereby cautioned that these statements may be effected by important factors, among others set forth in the Advisory Board Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and its third fiscal quarter news release. Consequently, actual operations or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward- looking statements. For additional information on the company’s results and outlook, please refer to its third fiscal quarter news release. The company undertakes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Executive Chairman, Mr. Frank Williams. Frank Williams Thank you and good evening. I’m Frank Willams, Executive Chairman of the Advisory Board, and I’m joined this evening by Robert W. Musslewhite, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. In terms of this evening’s call, we’ve organized the discussion into four sections. First, I’ll give you a brief summary our performance for the quarter that ended on December 31st as well as the broader market environment across the quarter. I’ll then turn it over to Robert to discuss our outlook for 2009, including more depth on the critical factors affecting our members and how we are responding across the business. Michael will then take us through a more detailed review of the financials and our guidance for calendar year 2009, and Robert will then wrap with a few closing comments. Of course, we’ll be happy to take your questions at the end of the call. Let me start with our financial results. In the quarter ended December 31, 2008, Advisory Board revenues were 59.3 million, up 6% from $55.9 million last year. Net income was $5.8 million or $0.37 per diluted share compared to $7.9 million or $0.42 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. As of December 31, 2008, our contract value grew to $230.9 million, up from $225.4 million the prior year. We are pleased that we met our revenue and EPS guidance despite a worsening economic environment for our membership base in the last half of the year. However, we are disappointed that contract value and our accompanying outlook for revenue in 2009 came in below our expectations and historical growth rates. In terms of the market, we saw a very difficult environment in the last quarter as our members’ financial performance worsened and their outlook for 2009 deteriorated. Despite strong attachment to our clear value proposition, a number of members have delayed decisions to join new programs or even declined outright due to large organizational wide budget cuts or in many cases complete budget freezes. While the new business environment was more challenging across the board, performance did vary by program. Our core strategy and operations research programs held up reasonably well as did our analytical tool programs oriented at specific margin-related issues. The education practice also performed relatively well as the pressure on state budgets created urgency around universities’ need for best practices to cut costs and create efficiencies. Our programs oriented around leadership development, our higher price point insulation support programs, and our workforce and nursing-oriented research programs did not fair as well. This is consistent with our historical experience in a tougher economy as training and consulting budgets in certain areas are substantially, but it was even more acute in the last few months of the year. Renewals which had held strong through the September quarter also showed some signs of softening as 2008 came to a close with a few members, particularly larger institutions, pushing out renewal decisions. We are encouraged that we nonetheless ended the year within our historical renewal rate range and with countless examples of members driving great value from our margin improvement research. Thus far, in 2009, the environment feels consistent with what we were seeing at the end of last year, so right now we are focused on strong execution in a tough environment and on positioning the organization for growth and scale once the economic portions of our members improve. Let me now turn things over to Robert to provide more background on the current dynamics of our market, our outlook for 2009, and our plan for the coming year. Robert Musslewhite As Frank mentioned, hospitals have been pushed into conservative spending posture by several specific factors related to the broader economy. I’ll quickly touch on just three of them. First, hospitals have seen a shift in case mix as volumes have slowed in key surgical and ambulatory areas with patients delaying care consumption for elective procedures. With a large proportion of hospital margins coming from procedures and outpatient services, this softening also creates downward pressure on hospital profitability. Second, with greater contraction in the broader economy and continued job losses, hospitals nationwide are facing a growing burden of uncompensated care and patient bad debt putting further pressure on margins. Third, capital availability has been constrained with a substantial drop-off in hospital investment income, restricted capital access for municipal borrowers, and general fear about the direction of the economy. This has led to real constraints on the capital budgeting side and tightening of operating budgets in almost every area. The combination of these factors has driven a dramatic tightening of hospital budgets and unwillingness to spend products and services that fall outside of direct patient care. As a result, we are anticipating roughly flat revenues for calendar year 2009 based on our current visibility. It’s possible that our growth rate could be a few points above or below that number, and while we do have strong visibility into 80% of our forward revenues at this time of the year, it is difficult to provide greater precision given the higher levels of uncertainty in the current environment. Let me give you some color on the assumptions shaping our growth outlook. As Frank discussed, we felt increasing pressure on renewals in the fourth quarter. We had a solid renewal year overall in 2008. Given the budget issues that our members are experiencing, we are assuming a tougher renewal environment for 2009. On the new business side, while we are rapidly repositioning our programs around financial topics, we assume that new business will continue to be challenging in 2009. Our assumption is that sales trends will mirror those that we saw in the latter part of 2008 with leadership development and installation and support programs as well as workforce and nursing-oriented programs harder hit relative to core strategy and operation research programs and our analytical tool programs focused on margin-related issues. Given slowing revenue growth, we are projecting EBITDA in the range of $27 million to $33 million. This level reflects two forces that work on costs. On the one hand, we took aggressive actions on a number of important cost items. In all, we removed more than $10 million from our existing cost base through restructuring program operations in a number of areas to drive greater efficiency, reducing bonus and salary levels, and making selective position reductions. We continue to scrutinize each additional expenditure and new resource decision as well as search for additional efficiencies across the firm, and we have the entire organization focused on improved performance. On the other hand, we strongly believe that we should make key investments this year in three critical areas to position the organization for strong top and bottom line growth when the economy begins to improve. The first area is a largely one-time investment in our core technology platform across our analytical tools programs. We have an opportunity to upgrade our current data extraction and loading process through the development of more standardized tools for implementation, particularly in accessing data from clinical systems. This investment represents approximately $7 million in operating expense for calendar year 2009. While we have made some important investments in individual analytical tools programs across the last two years, an improved and more integrated platform is key to increasing predictability of installations and will set us up well for improved scalability and margin expansion as we continue to add new members through our existing programs and new programs for the platform. The long-term return on investment is quite attractive given the future growth of the analytical tools business and the new market that is opening up for us. The second area is a new program development which has two primary components. Last year we launched four new programs, which are still scaling and therefore have a full year of costs in this calendar year as we continue to expand membership. The additional cost in 2009 associated with scaling these launches is approximately $6 million. We also want to take advantage of the current economic climate to launch financially focused new programs across the coming year to address the acute issues that our members are facing. New investment in these programs represents approximately $4 million in operating expenses for calendar year 2009. This obviously will have a negative impact on this year’s margins because of the upfront fixed cost nature of these programs, but it will help to drive growth and improved profitability as these programs scale over time. We are already seeing a strong response in our early charter advisor conversations about these programs, so we are optimistic about their prospects. Finally, we are planning to invest about $3 million in our sales and marketing organization to ensure that we are most effectively generating inbound interest from the membership and rapidly converting this interest into new sales. This includes one-time investments to optimize the process for modifying our sales collateral quickly to focus on the hottest highest ROI areas, update our CRM system, and add a few key sales people in newly developed roles. The net effect of all these changes to last year’s cost base is to increase expenses this year by roughly $10 million. Without these investments, we would have seen improved EBITDA margins even at flat revenue growth due to our cost cutting measures. While these investments impact our profitability for the upcoming calendar year, we believe that there are important steps to take today to position the company to drive top line growth as the economic environment for our members improves and for scaling our growing analytical tools business which will help with long-term margin performance. Now, let me turn to how we are responding across the business to this challenging environment. We’ve taken a number of measures that we believe position us well to both weather the current downturn and prepare for future growth. These initiatives fall into three main categories. Our first area of focus is ensuring that our agendas, services, and message positioning are all highly tuned to members’ needs during this time of particular volatility and uncertainty. We had a tremendous response to the work that our research teams have done across all terrains to provide both real-time in-depth analysis of financial developments and immediately actionable insight to help members navigate this difficult economy. The initiative has been organized around five critical imperatives: Maximum revenue capture, containing supply costs, managing labor costs, reprioritizing capital allocation, and securing profitable volumes. We have had more than 2000 key member executives actively engage with us on the material through a series of teleconferences across December and January. In addition, we’ve reached another 9000 CXOs through our Leadership through the Downturn Series of five best practice implementation tool kits published across the course of just six weeks, and we expect to host over 500 chief executive officers at our CEO round table meetings on the topic in the early part of year of this year. Executive reaction to material has been extremely positive. Our secondary focus is in improving cross sell performance through a number of initiatives in our sales and marketing group. First of all, we are creating much stronger linkages between our renewal teams and the sales force to drive a much more strategic and relationship oriented approach in the sales process. We are achieving this end through both technology by an upgraded CRM system and organizational changes that better align the two groups. Secondly, we are focused on improved allocation of resources around our high return programs such as CFO program and our revenue cycle, supply chain, and bad debt performance programs. As such, we have heavily concentrated merchandizing and promotion efforts in these areas and have disproportionately allocated top sales talent here as well. Taking these actions has been a very easy decision given the compelling stories we have collected about the rapid impact our members are seeing from these programs. For example, one health system in its first 100 days as a member of our revenue cycle performance program reduced AR days by 9% to achieve an increasing cash collection of $8 million. Another hospital achieved over $1 million in savings through contract renegotiations, identified through their participation in our supply chain performance program, and a two-hospital system realized an over $5 million improvement to the bottom line by using our bad debt performance program to increase collections and decrease collection costs. For each of these stories, we have dozens more; therefore, we are hopeful we can create some momentum on the sales side by highlighting the tangible economic improvements from participation in these programs. Finally, we continue to emphasize strong execution in every aspect of the sale process to improve conversion rates and to ensure strong accountability across the sales organization. The third area of focus and our response to the current environment is focused new product development. We have tasked our NPD team with identifying mission critical program ideas that drive strong rapid financial returns with the goal of launching these programs quickly in order to be responsive to the key points of the membership. We anticipate continuing our launch pace of three to four new programs this year and firmly believe that this ongoing NPD focus will not only provide near term revenue contributions but also set us up well for the future. To that end, I’m pleased today to announce the launch of the University Business Executive Program, our third program in the education space. University business executives oversee all the business and administrative functions of the university and have a 40% to 50% of the overall university operating budget under their control. Working closely with the provost, they run the university day to day and advise the president on such key strategic issues as enfranchising academic leaders in business transformation, hardwiring cost discipline, and making difficult capital allocation choices as universities face the need to replacing aging facilities. The university business executive program is a renewable membership program that provides best practice research, peer networking, and benchmarking tools to assist university business executives in addressing these and other key operational and strategic issues. The membership is designed to help university business executives better mange financial operations, set priorities, and measure and improve performance. As always we have established a strong chartered membership for the program including Georgetown, Brown, Cornell, Indiana University, Boulder, Texas Tech, and Cal Tech. Despite the tough environment, we remain confident about the long-term growth potential of the healthcare and education verticals given the level of spend, the complexity of the issues that organizations in these sectors face and our ability to effectively drive performance improvement through our unique membership model. That the most progressive universities across the country are meeting our early work in the education realm with such enthusiasm illustrates our ability to successfully expand into this new market segment. We are similarly optimistic about our opportunities in several other areas including applying our expertise across the international market and leveraging our growing data asset to serve the non-hospital healthcare sector. With that, let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail and to provide some additional color on our 2009 guidance. Michael Kirshbaum We’ve organized today’s financial review around five categories: Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, and outlook for calendar year 2009. First the income statement, a quick reminder that we on a March 31st fiscal year end which means we just finished the third quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 6.1% to $59.3 million, up from $55.9 million in the same period last year. Income from operations, net income, and earnings per diluted share were $7.8 million, $5.8 million, and $0.37 respectively with the quarter ending December 31, 2008 compared to $10.2 million, $7.9 million, and $0.42 respectively for the same quarter last year. Costs of services increased to 50.1 of revenue compared to $46.7 of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. Increasing cost of services was primarily due to increased cost associated with new program launches, increased consulting and licensing fees associated with some of our analytic tools programs and costs from our integration of Princeton operations. Increasing cost of services as a percentage of revenue is also attributable to the impact of lower revenue growth and our largely fixed cost structure. Member relations and marketing expense was 22.8% of revenue compared to 21.2% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in expense is attributable mainly to our increase in the number of sales teams. We currently have 112 sales teams in place compared to 107 in December 2007. D&A expense in the quarter decreased to 11.5% of revenue compared to 12.1% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year due to the scaling of our fixed administrative cost over a larger revenue base. Deprecation and amortization expense in the quarter increased to 2.4% of revenue compared to 1.7% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. This increases primarily from the amortization of capitalized cost related to the development of analytical tools for some of our new programs and the amortization of intangible accents from the Crimson accusation. Now moving on to our 9-month income statement results, for the 9 months ended December 31, 2008, revenues increased 8.1% to $174.2 million, up from $161 million last year. Income from operations, net income, and earnings per diluted share were $23.1 million, $17.6 million, and $1.04 respectively for the 9 months ended December 31, 2008, compared to $30.6 million, $23.5 million, and $1.25 respectively through the same period last year. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable which excludes long-term receivables increased to $127.3 million as of December 31, 2008, versus $93.3 million as December 31, 2007. DSOs as calculated using average receivables were 176 days in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, up from 158 days last quarter and 133 days in December 2007. Increase in DSOs is due to the continued increasing mix towards our higher price point programs which include more progress billings. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs on billed AR remained consistent with our reputations, and we’re 57 days as of December 31, 2008, similar to the same metric in 2007, which was 58 days. Deferred revenue net of amount that build up for 12 months increased 19.7% to $182.3 million as of December 31, 2008, up from $152.3 million as of December 31, 2007. The increase in deferred revenue is due mainly to higher proportion of multi-year contracts. Excluding pre-paid contract and long-term deferred, the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2008, was $155.4 million, up 13.5% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the 3 months ended December 31, 2008, we generated $17.8 million of cash from operating activities compared to $24 million in the same quarter last year. For the nine months ending December 31, 2008, cash flow generated from operations was $30.1 million, or 1.7 times net income, compared to $38.6 million or 1.6 times net income in the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2008, were approximately $3 million, of which $2.2 million was related to capitalized development of hardware associated with analytic tools included in some of our newer programs and $300,000 related to the build out of a new floor at our DC headquarters. For the three months ended December 31, 2008, we repurchased $13.2 million of stock or approximately 512,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $299 million or approximately 6.9 million. As of December 31, 2008, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $51 million. At December 31, 2008, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances were approximately $90.9 million. As to contract value, contract value increased 2.4% to $230.9 million as of December 31, 2008, up from $225.4 million as of December 31, 2007. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts of more than 12 months’ duration, we include only 12 months in contract value. With respect to calendar year 2009, the following comments are intended to follow under the safe harbor provision as outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar year 2009, we anticipate revenue to be relatively flat when compared to calendar year 2008. Our gross rate could be a few points above or below that number, but it’s difficult to provide greater precision given the higher level of uncertainty in the current environment. We expect EBITDA in the range of approximately $27 million to $33 million and earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.90 to $1.20. Included in this EBITDA and EPS guidance are the cost reductions and investments that Robert mentioned earlier. As discussed these investments are growth focused and largely one time in nature. Without these investments, we would have expected increasing EBITDA margins for 2009. We expect revenue to be evenly distributed to slightly back-weighted on the year, and EBITDA and EPS to be fairly evenly distributed across the year. For calendar 2009, we will be a federal cash tax payer, but still expect cash flow from operations to be approximately 1.5 to 2 times net income. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $10 to $15 million in the calendar year 2009, compared to $16 million in calendar ’08. This estimated amount consists mainly of continued investment in both internal and external development resources to build web-based tools for some of our recent new program launches. For calendar 2009, we expect an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 31.5 to 33.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I’ll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert Masslewhite Our entire staff is aligned and accountable for flawless execution, and our leadership team is fully engaged in making the operational adjustments required to get the organization on a strong growth path as the economy improves. While we are all in heads-down execution mode at the moment, we continue with the conviction that we have a great opportunity for future growth, and our action plan for 2009 reflects that belief. Despite the tough current economic environment, we are squarely focused on building a scalable high- growth company which provides world class programs and services to our healthcare and higher education membership. The industries we serve, while under financial pressure at the moment, offer extraordinary growth potential over the long term, and we intend to strengthen our position across the coming year to capture that potential. We continue to have a very strong business model, a balance sheet with no debt, and over $90 million in cash, and renewable revenue base which will serve us well in the current business climate. Most of all, we believe that our fantastic and committed talent, extraordinary assets of intellectual capital, and unique member relationships will stand us in good stead over the long term. That completes the formal part of the call, and now we’ll be happy to take your questions."
179,GV_145042_2010Q3,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advisory Board Company's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

For additional information on the company's results and outlook, please refer to its third fiscal quarter news release. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musselwhite. Please proceed. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Good evening. I'm Robert Musselwhite, CEO of the Advisory Board, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our quarter ended December 31, 2009, covering our financial results and the drivers of our business performance. I'll then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials and other key performance metrics, as well as our guidance for calendar year 2010. Finally, I will close with updates on our strategic and operational priorities for the year ahead. Of course, as always, we'll be happy to take your questions at the end of the presentation. Revenue for the quarter increased 2.7% to $60.9 million from $59.3 million in the quarter ended December the 31, 2008. Contract value grew 10% to $253.7 million as of December 31, 2009, up from $230.9 million as of December 31, 2008. Net income was $4.3 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared to $5.8 million or $0.37 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. EBITDA was $7.3 million for the quarter, compared to $9.2 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2008. Overall, we were pleased with how calendar year 2009 ended. As all of us can no doubt recall, 2009 began in the midst of a challenging environment, with considerable uncertainty in both the overall economy and our end markets. In that context, the stability that we deliver including concluding the year with flat revenues, hitting the midpoint level of our EBITDA and EPS guidance ranges and establishing solid contract value acceleration is a testament to our intense focus across all of our programs on delivering high and consistent value to our members on their most critical issues. In addition, we are especially pleased that momentum through the latter part of 2009 has put us back on our revenue and earnings growth trajectory into 2010. So now I'll be back in the position to project 10% growth, with an accompanying strong increase in earnings, is an accomplishment of which all of us are proud. I believe that our stability in 2009 is the direct result of three critical success factors: First, we developed a strong plan for weathering the downturn and our incredibly talented group of employees executed well in that plan; second, we maintained our focus on providing our members high-value, relevant research software tools and services that address their most important challenges; and third, we innovated to continue the expansion of our business, introducing new programs and services that deepen our member relationships, are targeted to their high-urgency issues and bring additional stickiness and scalability to our portfolio. Let me give you a bit more detail on each of these critical success factors in turn. First, in our conference call with you last year at this time, I laid out our action plan for 2009, which included an intense focus on cost discipline throughout the organization coupled with key investments in three important areas: Improving the scalability of our software tools programs, enhancing our sales and marketing function and continuing new program development efforts, with a particular focus on launching direct margin improvement-oriented programs to address our members' acute issues. Given the position in which we find ourselves one year later, it is clear that these efforts were key to our stability and the dual-track approach of cost discipline and targeted investment continues to guide our thinking as we look ahead at 2010. Our investments in our software tools programs have resulted in a more predictable data extraction and loading process, particularly in accessing data from clinical systems due to the development of more standardized tools for implementation. With the bulk of this work complete, we have largely phased out this area of investment, and we expect improved scale, renewability and cross-sales as a result. Our sales and marketing investments yielded positive benefits in effectively generating inbound interest from our membership and driving solid new bookings growth across the year. We will continue to invest  in sales and marketing in 2010 to ensure that we have the infrastructure to develop and execute on all the most leveraged demand generation strategies available to us, and to set up strong business growth in 2011. Our new product development investments, which I will discuss in greater depth in a few minutes, have also served us very well, and we continue to focus on rolling out timely new programs to our markets. Finally, we sustained our cost-discipline efforts across 2009, and with the cost-conscious culture solidly in place at all levels of the organization, we'll continue to do so in 2010. Turning now to the second critical success factor, our ongoing focus on providing relevant, in-depth research on our member's most important challenges has been another key driver of our stability. Over the past year, the prospect of massive industry reform has been at the top of our members' CEOs' agenda. With the politics of the national reform debate capturing headlines across the country, our members have consistently look to us to distill the noise of the 24-hour news cycle into meaningful insights, intangible, actionable recommendations about how to prepare for success in the new healthcare economy. Given the uncertainties around expanded coverage and insurance market changes, uncertainty's thrown into sharp relief following the recent Massachusetts Senate race. Throughout the debate, our research is focused heavily on the more fundamental issue of reforming the care delivery system. In our view, this is an imperative for our members, independent of the outcome of the current discussions down the street on Capitol Hill. We believe that transformation of care delivery is essential for our members, period. Two forces are driving this need for change. First, federal spending on healthcare continues to escalate, and as we enter an era of federal focus on deficit reduction, it is very likely that changes are in store for the Medicare portion of hospitals' revenues. Measures like outright price cuts and new payment incentives aimed at bending the cost curve require fundamental changes in the way our members work with physicians and care for patients. And they need our help to make these changes successfully. Second, these reimbursement realities coincide with hospitals need to develop new care models that allow them to make a margin caring for seniors. As baby boomers surge into the Medicare program, the traditional approach of cross-subsidizing below cost government reimbursement with lucrative commercial payments will become increasingly difficult. Forward-looking hospitals are investing in chronic disease management capabilities, new physician alignment models, care coordination and information-powered healthcare delivery, all of which are complex undertakings where members seek our assistance. In this context our, research is focused on four key imperatives for our members: Prepare for accountable payment models, hardwire operational efficiencies, transform primary care and capture the clinical and strategic value of information technology. Over the last six months, we've hosted more than 30 meetings on these topics all across the country, with more than 2,500 executives in attendance. The feedback on the work has been outstanding. Chief executive officers graded the material a full 10 points higher than prior meetings series of GPOs, and their comments bring to life the impact of the work. For example, one executive wrote, ""This is the most comprehensive piece of research I've seen on the topic. It is an excellent treatment of a complex, fluid terrain."" The meeting series is complemented with a robust suite of member resources, more than two dozen tools, calculators and teleconferences on the four key imperatives. Members focused on preparing for accountable payment models that can take our payment reform preparedness diagnostic, use our bundled payment impacts calculator, or participate in our teleconference on building the accountable care organization. Those prioritizing hardwiring efficiency can join our executive roundtable on leading a high- performance cost campaign, or use our operational efficiency benchmark generator. Or if they choose, they can join our Surgery Performance program cohort or our Emergency Department Performance program cohort. The list goes on. With an extensive library and set of resources available, we are able provide concrete guidance to our members, helping them navigate through very uncertain times. The value they derive from our work reinforces our position as trusted adviser and manifest as they renewed their memberships with us. Third, and finally, our ongoing focus on and investment in new product development was important to our stability in 2009 and is critical to our 2010 outlook. Let me briefly give an update on four recent launches, which have focused on our members' top issues this year. The revenue cycle, which has of course gained special attention from the membership during the downturn and physician issues in area of key importance, as members seek to inflect cost and quality metrics. The results of these programs and our other recent launches showed that even in challenging times, there is still an acute need for new programs that provide large, rapid returns around the key pain points of the membership. Two recent launches enhanced our strong portfolio in the revenue cycle terrain. First, the Revenue Integrity Performance program offers both tangible near-term margin impact, an important assistance in preparing for government RAC audits, which have the potential for tremendous financial downside for institutions. Second, the Payment Navigation Performance Program drives transparency on patient's financial obligation for each episode of care, allowing members to improve collections on these portions of patient bills. Both launches had strong momentum through the close of the year, illustrating the centrality of these issues for our members. In the physician terrain, our Crimson Physician Management Performance program and our Clinical Integration Initiative, each addressed the imperative for hospitals and physicians to cooperate in order to provide high-quality, cost-effective care, and are particularly important given the momentum towards delivery system reform that I discussed earlier. Both programs saw a very strong finish to the year in terms of both impact delivered to current members and new sales. With different approaches to the issue, the two products complement each other well on what is arguably the most critical issues set for health systems today. In that context, I am very pleased to announce that as of December 31, we have considerably increased our depth in this area with the acquisition of Southwind Health Partners, a leading healthcare industry management and advisory firm focused on hospital physician alignment and hospital-sponsored physician practice management. We are thrilled on Southwind's exceptional talent and superior expertise in the hospital physician terrain to our portfolio and are excited to leverage Southwind's strong brand and outstanding intellectual property to supplement our successful best practice research in clinical integration work. The acquisition also represents a fantastic opportunity to significantly enhance our growing Crimson platform. And we anticipate some exciting developments on front going forward. With the addition of Southwind, the Advisory Board will now offer a more comprehensive portfolio to help members with all aspects and models of physician alignment. To that end, I'm excited to announce today the launch of our newest program, the Southwind Practice Management Program, which leverages Southwind's core competencies to serve member hospitals seeking to improve the performance of their owned or affiliated physician practices. The program provides strategic and operational support to help system executives responsible for aligning the interests and behavior of physicians in order to achieve key clinical quality and financial performance goals. As part of this launch, we've been privileged to have support from Southwind's current client base as we build out the program and extend it to other hospitals and health systems across the nation. Our efforts here will be led by Southwind's founder John Deane and the outstanding team of Southwind professionals that has, over the last dozen years, forged the firm's sterling reputation with hospitals as the go-to physician practice management experts, who consistently deliver predictable, positive results. I'm extremely gratified that the entire Southwind leadership team has committed to a long-term employment with us. And I'm proud to welcome this remarkably high-caliber group to the company. It is clear that they share the values that have made our firm strong: A commitment to the industry, a passion for insight, and an unyielding drive toward tangible impact. I look forward to working with John and his entire team for many years to come to guide our members on this pivotal set of issues. With that, let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail and to provide our guidance for calendar year 2010. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around five categories: Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for calendar year 2010. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on a March 31 fiscal year end , which means we just finished the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 2.7% to $60.9 million, up from $59.3 million in the same period last year. EBITDA, net income and earnings per diluted share were $7.3 million, $4.3 million and $0.27, respectively, for the quarter ending December 31, 2009, compared to $9.2 million, $5.8 million and $0.37, respectively, for the same quarter last year. Cost of services increased to $32.1 million or 52% of revenue in the quarter ending December 31, 2009, compared to $29.7 million or 50.1% of revenue in the same quarter, the prior year. The increase in cost of services is primarily due to increased cost associated with new programs. Member relations and marketing expense was $13.8 million or 22.7% of revenue in the quarter ending December 31, 2009, compared to $13.5 million or 22.8% of revenue in the same quarter, the prior year. We currently have 112 sales team in place, the same as 112 sales team we had in place, the quarter ending December 31, 2008. G&A expense increased to $7.7 million or 12.6% of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 compared to $6.8 million or 11.5% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year, due primarily to increased investment in new program development, as well as $500,000 of transaction costs related to the acquisition of Southwind. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $1.4 million or 2.3% of revenue compared to $1.4 million or 2.4% of revenue in the same quarter, the prior year. Other income net in the quarter was $600,000 compared to $774,000 in the same period, the prior year. The decrease in other income is due to the lower balance of marketable securities and lower interest rates on our invested cash. Moving on to our nine-month income statement results. For the nine months ending December 31, 2009, revenue increased to $175.9 million, up from $174.2 million last year. Excluding the one-time non-cash charges incurred in the September 2009 quarter, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $21.9 million, $12.5 million and $0.81, respectively, for the nine months ending December 31, 2009, compared to $26.9 million, $17.6 million and $1.04, respectively, for the same period last year. GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share were $6.4 million and $0.41, respectively, for the nine months ending December 31, 2009. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results can be found in our press release. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased 14% to $145.1 million as of December 31, 2009, compared to $127.3 million at December 31, 2008. DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables, were 205 days in the quarter ending December 31, 2009, up from 176 days in December 31, 2008, and up from 195 days as of March 31, 2009. The year-over-year increase in DSOs is due to continued increase in mix towards our higher price point programs, which include more progress billings, as well as more multi-year contracts. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs unbilled AR were 52 days as of December 31, 2009, down from 57 days as of December 31, 2008 due to improved collections. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we build up to 12 months, increased to $202.5 million as of December 31, 2009, up 11.1% from $182.3 million as of December 31, 2008. Excluding prepaid contracts and long-term deferred, the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2009, was $177.1 million, up 13.9% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ending December 31, 2009, our cash generated from operating activities increased to $18.7 million, compared to $17.8 million in the same quarter last year. The nine months ending December 31, 2009, cash flow generated from operations was $27.5 million compared to $30.1 million in the same period last year. Cash flow from operations for the nine months ending December 31, 2009 was 2.2x adjusted net income compared to 1.7x for the same period last year. For fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, we expect cash flow from operations as a percentage of net income to exceed our typical range of approximately 1.5x to 2x adjusted net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending December 31, 2009 were approximately $300,000 compared to $3.3 million in capital expenditures for the three months ending December 31, 2008. The decrease is due to reduced levels of capital expenditures associated with our analytic tools program this year when compared to the same period, the prior year. Free cash flow, cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures, was $18.4 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2009, up from $14.5 million in the same quarter last year. With the three months ending December 31, 2009, we repurchased $2 million of stock or approximately 76,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $307 million or approximately 7.3 million shares. As of December 31, 2009, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $43 million. As of December 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance were approximately $98.1 million, which is roughly $6 per share. Also during the quarter ending December 31, 2009, we've got approximately $11 million in cash for the acquisition of Southwind. At the contract value, contract value increased 9.9% to $253.7 million as of December 31, 2009, up from $230.9 million as of December 31, 2008. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time, without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months in contract value. With respect to the outlook for calendar year 2010, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provision outlined at the beginning of the call, and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2010, inclusive of the effects of the Southwind acquisition, we anticipate revenue to be approximately 10% higher than calendar 2009. We expect EBITDA in the range of approximately $36 million to $41 million, and earnings per diluted share of approximately $1.20 to $1.40. We expect EBITDA and EPS to be fund weighted to the first calendar quarter, as many of our investors for 2010 are not expected to ramp until the beginning of the second quarter of the calendar year. We expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $8 million for the calendar year. For the three months ending March 31, 2010, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 34.3%. And for fiscal year 2011, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35 1/2% to 36 1/2%. In addition, for fiscal year 2011, we expect cash flow from operations to continue to be 1 1/2 to 2x net income and CapEx of approximately $10 million. We expect Southwind to be approximately three percentage points of the previously-stated 2010 revenue growth, and expect minimal impact in EBITDA and EPS in 2010. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about the year ahead, and then we will take any questions you have. We were gratified that our work across 2009 has given us a strong platform of business stability and put us back on a growth trajectory, and we entered 2010, energized and excited about the opportunities ahead of us. At the same time, we are also cognizant that our members still face significant challenges. And we know that in order to achieve our objectives, we must execute at a high standard and continue to deliver world-class programs that drive significant value. Therefore, we will continue our work this year with a sustained focus on execution in four key areas: First, we continue to provide critical performance management for our membership, with relevant, timely and actionable research, tools and services focused on their most pressing issues; our world-class research asset, library of best practices and successful software tools programs across multiple key areas of the hospital, provide a foundation that allows us to be an important partner in transforming the hospital, and increasingly, the university enterprise. Our deep involvement with our large and prestigious membership base provides frequent conversations with the industry executives about their most urgent issues, such as accountable care migration, information technology transformation, and hardwiring operational efficiency. These discussions allow us to remain nimble, adjusting our research and rolling out new services across the year to address members' pressing concerns. Across our robust portfolio, each program has developed an exciting agenda that will help our members navigate what will surely continue to be difficult waters for time to come. Our track record as a trusted guide and deliver improvement solutions for key problem areas will stand us in good stead in this endeavor. Second, we will continue to concentrate on innovations in sales, marketing and account management, as well as the blocking and tackling work of flawless execution in these critical areas. In 2009, the improvement across the year in our sales and renewals performance was a lift to the business. And we are sustaining focus in these areas to ensure that the improvements continue into 2010 and beyond. For example, we are expanding our initiatives to drive warm leads, improve relationship building, leverage intelligence gathering on specific areas of member need, enhance collateral and positioning and develop innovative promotion strategies. Our sales, marketing and account management leadership and teams are strong as they have ever been, with multiple talent additions across the year and an impressive performance by our up-and-coming leaders and key players throughout each group. We enter 2010 with great energy behind our commercial operations, and expect to see solid results from our work here. Third, we continue to execute on our growth strategy. With our last several launches performing well, our sustained investment in new program development continues to be critical to our success. Looking ahead, we remain on track to introduce three to four new programs in 2010 to set up future growth. And we have a great pipeline of over 25 new program concepts under consideration for future rollouts. Additionally, as our research engine services companies such as Crimson and Southwind, with innovative and powerful best practice solutions, we will continue to apply both our deep insight into our members needs and our rigorous acquisition criteria to move forward on the select acquisitions that fit our growth strategy. We have a strong and dedicated team researching new programs and advancing ideas through our structured, proven new program development process, and we are excited about the potential to continue to evolve our business through launches that drive our portfolio to increased depth, stickiness and scalability. Finally, we believe in investing in world-class talent at all levels of the organization, placing a high priority on the attraction, development, engagement and retention of outstanding people. The greatest strength of the Advisory Board continues to be our incredibly-talented and committed employee base. And as we kick off 2010, it is clear that this group is excited and motivated to take advantage of the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead, both for them as individuals and for us collectively as a firm. I have confidence that if we deliver on this plan, we will continue to serve our investors well through strong top- and bottom-line growth, very attractive cash flow and extremely solid balance sheet, and a great platform of 2,800 members and 44 programs for continuing to elevate our impacts and reach in the industries we serve. Thank you for participating in tonight's call. Why don't we take time now to answer your questions?"

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Please proceed. Robert Musslewhite Thank you and good evening. I am Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I'm joined this evening by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. This, our February call, is in many ways our most important call each year. In this call, we will recap our full calendar year results, which because we operate the business on a calendar year basis is the best reflection of our overall performance. The results are a time of greatest visibility into our forward growth with over 85% of our revenue fully visible for the upcoming year. Thus we also provide our guidance for the upcoming calendar year at this time. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our quarter ended December 31, 2010, covering our financial results and the drivers of our business performance. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials and other performance metrics as well as our guidance for calendar year 2011. Finally, I will close with updates on our strategic and operational priorities for the year ahead. Of course, as always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the presentation. Revenue for the quarter increased 23.5% to $75.2 million from $60.9 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2009. Contracts value grew 18% to $300.2 million as of December 31, 2010, up from $253.7 million as of December 31, 2009. Net income was $3.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to $4.3 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.2 million for the quarter compared to $7.6 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2009. Overall, we are pleased with our 2010 performance. In a year that may be remembered as one of the most momentous and tumultuous year for American healthcare, it is tremendously gratifying that our members turned consistently to The Advisory Board for the insight, tools and on-the-ground experience to both guide them through this change and deliver a near-term return on their membership investment. The strong value that we provide to hospitals and health systems as well as colleges and universities drove the continued momentum that we saw across 2010 in both renewals and sales, while strengthening our member relationships and providing the foundation for additional relationship expansion in the future. Our strong top and bottomline growth in calendar 2010 combined with the inherent visibility of our business model affords us clarity of the continued success in 2011 as we expect another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Given the continued pace of change and transformation in the market, this growth is important because it allows us to make critical investments to take advantage of the current environment and set up future growth while still delivering solid bottomline results in the shorter term. As always, we are mindful that providing meaningful impact on our members' most critical and most complex problems will continue to be central to our success. In today's environment, that means we must lead members through a market transformation that is already beginning and is likely to bring ground- shifting changes in both care delivery and payment structures. The transition to accountable payment, that is reimbursement that reflects the value of services provided rather than purely the volume, poses the most formidable strategic challenge hospitals and health systems have faced in decades. The industry is moving toward a model of reimbursement that demands greater coordination, meaningful integration, high reliability and flawless operating efficiency. In setting and executing strategy, it is imperative that providers address the fundamental of delivery system transformation necessary to prosper in this emerging accountable payment environment. As our members wrestle with these issues and work to set their own course, they look at us to help navigate these uncharted waters. We are supporting and partnering with them in numerous ways. First, these issues have been at the center of our agendas across our research memberships. In addition to completing seven major research studies, we have held more than 30 membership meetings on these topics, reaching over 3,000 member executives and earning record-breaking scores from attendees. These include the highest ever GPAs for not only the national meeting series of our flagship health systems strategy program, but also our special chief executive meeting series attended by nearly 600 hospital and health systems CEOs. Through our health system strategy program, we also released an exciting new Accountable Care Readiness Diagnostic, an interactive web-based tool to help health system executives assess their institutions' readiness to deliver accountable care by accepting financial risk for total cost and quality of care delivered to a given population. This diagnostic provides members with an assessment of the organization's ability to deliver on the core competencies of accountable care within the context of their market's relative demand for new risk-based contracting vehicles. Member reaction to the tool has been outstanding. Diagnostics have been completed covering nearly 400 hospitals, and the assessments present us with very warm cross-sell opportunities as members seek our help to turn their result into concrete actions and investments, thereby becoming live prospects for our other software and services offerings. In addition to our work with members on these topics through our traditional research programs, we're also focusing on continuing to deliver a deeper level of service in this terrain. As I have consistently communicated, the occasion of healthcare reform provides us a fantastic opportunity to work more deeply with members as they undergo transformations in care delivery and payment and to truly partner with and lead them to success. And we have made numerous moves to bolster our capabilities to do so. First, through our recently launched Employee Health Performance Program that I discussed last quarter, we are partnering with members in the work of Population Health Management. We provide tools to help them increase appropriate care for their self-insured employees in order to improve outcomes, reduce overall cost of care and build a strong track record and competencies to help succeed with broader populations under new payment models that entail the assumption of additional risk. Our work in the cohort continues to go well with fantastic member participation and average opportunity assessment showing about $2 million of realizable savings per member. In an exciting development for our Employee Health Performance Program, I am pleased to announce that The Advisory Board has entered into a strategic alliance with Milliman. This unique arrangement brings the power of Milliman's MedInsight analytic platform to Advisory Board members, allowing them to benchmark planned performance, evaluate financial risks and improve clinical performance across the care continuum. As background, Milliman is the premier international healthcare actuarial consulting firm with 60 years of experience. Their Milliman MedInsight system is the foremost source of independent healthcare analytics. Trusted by many of the nation's largest health insurers, government agencies and national employers, MedInsight is used everyday to process and analyze healthcare data from more than 50 million people. And it incorporates proprietary algorithms, superior analysis and the ability to analyze performance and risks found only through deep industry expertise. Milliman and The Advisory Board have collaboratively developed several proprietary analytic and benchmarking tools exclusively available to Advisory Board members. These tools will enable members to manage population risk, benchmark performance and target opportunities for significant improvements in efficiency in quality of care. Member response to this new offering has been very positive, and we anticipate it being a very important resource in numerous ways as we help members prepare to successfully operate under accountable payment structures. Another way in which we are working more deeply with our members on these issues is of course through Crimson. For its 15% of all national admissions flowing through our solution, we continue to expand our strong footprint in the physician performance management analytics market. With the hiring of a new CEO for the business and superior talent at all levels of the team, we've ensured that our human capital can deliver superior value in this high-growth environment. Best of all are the real and measurable changes our members are achieving by using the technology to drive physician-led performance improvement. For example, at Henry Ford Macomb Hospital, part of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, the hospital's Chief Medical Officer led weekly reviews of Crimson data with a select group of 10 high-volume on-call physicians. By using Crimson to help the physicians identify opportunities to improve length of stay and resource utilization, the hospital achieved annualized savings of over $8,000 within six months of their Crimson deployment. With this example and scores of others like it, Crimson is proving to be a fantastic solution for our members as they seek improvements in cost and quality through physician-led changes. This is a critical competency for hospitals and health systems in an environment with changing incentives, including a focus on value and greater assumption of risk. Another critical competency is adherence to evidence-based medicines. As organizations prepare to take on risk, they also look to analytics and workflow tools that provide visibility across the patient population to enable appropriate clinical decisions. In that context, I am very pleased to announce today our acquisition of Cielo MedSolutions, the leading provider of population management analytics and patient registry software in the ambulatory environment. Cielo is located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and its tool, Cielo Clinic, is based on technology developed by physicians at the University of Michigan Health System's Department of Family Medicine. Cielo Clinic is a real-time point-of-care tool that supports continual and comprehensive care in ambulatory care medicine. Care teams use the product to ensure that patients are up-to-date on their prevention, screening and chronic disease management needs based on evidence-based guidelines. With 2,000 clinicians using the technology and 2 million patients flowing through the tool today, it has proven to have measurable impact. For example, one practice used Cielo to improve a key diabetic monitoring metric from 30% to 75% as well as numerous other metrics to meet the requirements of medical home incentive for Blue Cross and Blue Shield in their state. With the prospect of more pay-per-performance programs in the future, Cielo Clinic will be an essential tool for our members moving towards value-based payment structures, and it will greatly enhance the value proposition we deliver through Crimson. Finally, as we survey our portfolio of tools to help members with accountable and value-based care issues, the expertise and deep practice management services capabilities of our Southwind Division have also proven to be a valuable asset. Through the outstanding skills and experience of this team, we are able to have tremendous impact as we work closely with members on physician practice management issues on a day-to-day basis. We are continuing to add strong talent and leadership to the Southwind Division as its footprint expands in the market and are confident in the ongoing impact Southwind will continue to have for our members. Stepping back, as we look at the industry transformation before us, we are in a very exciting position. Having been ahead of the industry in our research, we began from a privileged position of expertise on accountable care and value-based systems and have worked over the last three years to build out not only our research on the topic, but also the platform of tools, services and capabilities that allows us to serve members deeply on these issues. As a result, we are now working closely with over 500 hospitals to drive change and shepherd this migration. And through our industry-leading set of insights, tools, technology and services, we have the most comprehensive portfolio capabilities in this space. We are also building similarly strong portfolios in other critical areas of member needs such as revenue cycle, clinical operations, workforce management and others. In these areas too, we have been developing greater depth and have significant opportunities to drive real member ROI. The path ahead is very exciting. And as we continue to innovate across all parts of the firm, we improve our ability to have impact on our members' most important strategic and operational issues. With that, let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail and to provide our guidance for calendar year 2011. Michael Kirshbaum Thanks, Robert. I have organized today's flash review around six categories: Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, acquisition of Cielo MedSolutions and outlook for calendar year 2011. First the income statement, a quick reminder that on March 31 fiscal yearend, which means we just finished the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 23.5% to $75.2 million, up from $60.9 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $9.2 million, $4.6 million and $0.28 respectively for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to $7.6 million, $4.3 million and $0.27 respectively for the same quarter last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, exclude a fair value adjustment to one of the company's acquisition-related earn-out liabilities of $1.1 million. GAAP net income and earning per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, were $3.9 million and $0.24 respectively. A reconciliation of our GAAP to adjusted results can be found in our press release. Cost of services was $41.2 million or 54.8% of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to $32.1 million or 52.7% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in cost of services is due to increased cost from new programs, including cost associated with acquisitions of Southwind and Concuity as well as continued expansion of our Crimson platform. Also included in the cost of services for the three months ended December 31, 2010, was a $1.1 million fair value adjustment that I mentioned earlier and $1 million of amortization-related acquisitions compared to $0.2 million for the same quarter of the prior year. Member relations and marketing expense was $17.1 million or 22.7% of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to $13.8 million or 22.7% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. We currency have 133 sales teams in place, an increase from the 112 sales teams for the quarter ending December 31, 2009, as we have pulled forth hires in the early start of calendar year 2011. G&A expense increased to $9.7 million or 13% revenue in the quarter ending December 31, 2010, compared to $7.7 million or 12.6% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year due primarily to an increase in talent recruitment expenses as well as increased investment in additional new product development costs and investment in information systems infrastructure. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $1.5 million or 2% of revenue compared to $1.4 million or 2.3% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. Other income net in the quarter was $408,000 compared to $603,000 in the same period of the prior year with the change attributable to lower interest rates on our invested cash and securities. Now looking on to our nine-month income statement results, for the nine months ending December 31, 2010, revenue increased 21.1% to $213 million, up from $175.9 million last year. Excluding the fair value adjustment incurred this quarter, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earning per diluted share were $28.5 million, $14.4 million and $0.88 respectively for the nine months ending December 31, 2010. Excluding the one-time non-cash charges incurred in the September 2009 quarter, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for the nine months ended December 31, 2009, were $26.6 million, $12.5 million and $0.80 respectively. GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the nine months ended December 31, 2010, were $13.4 million and $0.80 compared to $6.4 million and $0.41 respectively in the same period last year. Reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted results can be found on our press release. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased to $196 million as of December 31, 2010, compared to $145.1 million as of December 31, 2009. DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables for 211 days in the quarter ended December 31, 2010, were up slightly from 205 days as of December 31, 2009. Excluding the effects of progress billings, DSOs on billed AR were 51 days as of December 31, 2010, compared to 52 days as of December 31, 2009. Deferred revenue net of amounts that we billed after 12 months increased to $274.6 million as of December 31, 2010, up 36% from $202.5 million as of December 31, 2009. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2010, was $222.8 million, up 26% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ended December 31, 2010, we generated $24.6 million of cash from operating activities, an increase of 32% over $18.7 million generated for the same quarter last year. For the nine months ended December 31, 2010, cash flow generated from operating activities grew 22% to $33.6 million compared to $27.5 million in the same period last year. For calendar 2010, cash flow from operations were 2.8 times net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2010, were approximately $5.1 million compared to $300,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2009. This increase was due to increased levels of capitalized expenditures associated with our analytic tools program this year when compared to same quarter of the prior year. For the three months ended December 31, 2010, we repurchased $2 million of stock or approximately 41,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchased since the inception of the program in 2004 to $314.5 million or approximately 7.5 million shares. As of December 31, 2010, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $35.5 million. As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $107.6 million, up approximately $6.48 per share. The contract value increased 18.3% to $300.2 million as of December 31, 2010, up from $253.7 million as of December 31, 2009. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to the initial term or remaining duration in many such agreements. The contracts with more than 12 months of duration will include only 12 months of contract value. Turning to the acquisition of Cielo MedSolutions, the company has also announced that we've purchased all the assists of Cielo MedSolutions, a provider of population management and patient registry analytics and workflow tools, at a purchase price of approximately $7.5 million with additional potential consideration to be paid if certain business performance conditions are met across the next 18 months. We expect the Cielo acquisition to have an immaterial impact on our core revenue in calendar year 2011. We expect it to be approximately $3million diluted EBITDA with an additional $1 million of acquisition- related intangibles in calendar year 2011. We expect the acquisition to be breakeven to slightly accretive to EBITDA in calendar year 2012. For the outlook for calendar 2011, following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2011, we expect revenue to be in the range of approximately $318 million to $326 million. In order to provide greater clarity and to better reflect our operating performance, we are providing adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance. Adjusted EBITDA for calendar 2011 will exclude share-based compensation expense and adjustments of acquisition-related earn-out liabilities. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share for calendar 2011 will exclude share-based compensation expense, amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets and adjustments of acquisition-related earn-out liabilities. We expect calendar 2011 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of approximately $56 million to $60 million, reflecting growth of 17% to 25%. We expect calendar year 2011 non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $1.85 to $2.00. We expect the distribution of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be back-weighted on the calendar year. This guidance is inclusive of the $3 million dilutive effect of the acquisition of Cielo. Excluding the impact of Cielo, we would have expected calendar year 2011 adjusted EBITDA growth of 23% to 32% over calendar year 2010. For calendar 2011, we expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $10 million and expect amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets to be approximately $4.5 million. We expect capital expenditures in calendar year 2011 to be approximately $15 million for furniture, fixtures and equipment as well as capitalize developed software expenses, plus an additional $7 million for real estate expansion in our DC and Austin offices. For fiscal year 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 36.5% and 37.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert Musslewhite Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about the year ahead, and then we'll take questions you have. We're gratified that the outstanding value we delivered to hospitals, health systems, colleges and universities in 2010 has helped put us back on a growth trajectory. And entering 2011, we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. In order to capitalize on those opportunities, it is essential that we make smart investments, execute at a highest standard across the year and continue to deliver world-class programs that drive significant returns for our members. Therefore we'll continue our work this year with a sustained focus in four key areas. First, we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions and new relationships into the broader portfolio in order to ensure that we maximize the benefit both to the membership and to the business of the new products and services. With our successful Crimson integration and strong progress in the acquisitions and relationships from late 2009 and the first half of 2010, including Southwind, Concuity and HIMSS Analytics, we are building a track record for quickly leveraging new assets to the firm. We're applying the knowledge we've gained through these experiences to ensure that our work with Milliman MedInsight and our new Cielo acquisition are successful in driving increased value to and deeper relations with our membership. Across all these new endeavors, our early progress has been strong and we are optimistic that with focused and hard work each of these initiatives will yield important benefits for the firm's key strategic verticals. We will continue to invest to capture the unique opportunities presented by current healthcare market conditions. This is a tremendously exciting time in healthcare. The market is changing rapidly and we see enormous opportunities to both grow our business and make major contributions to improving healthcare in our country. As we face the potential transformation of the healthcare market the likes of which we've not seen in lifetimes, it is critical that we position ourselves to continue market leadership. Only by growing our extensive expertise, leveraging our deep relationships and position as trusted advisor and continuing to invest in innovating and evolving the portfolio will we be able to do so. As such, new product development remains a tough priority for me and the executive team. We remain confident that just as our 2009 new product and business development investments paid off with strong top and bottomline growth in 2010 and our 2010 investments have positioned us for strong growth in 2011, our current investments in new product activity will have the same effect of setting us up well for future growth. Our third priority is ensuring outstanding value delivery to members and flawless execution across the firm. As we expand our portfolio, it is critical that value delivery across all of our programs remains a top priority for everyone in the firm. This is something that we never take for granted. Rather we continue to work hard to deliver innovative research and tools, excellent service, reliable and high impact software and real impact to members of every program. This paves the way for the relationships, (leadership) and cultivation so key to our success. On that front, we continue to enhance the sophistication and impact of our account management and sales teams through training, ongoing innovations in capturing and qualifying information for member touch points and support from our strategic marketing group. Having spent a great deal of time with the account management and sales teams over the past several months, I can tell you that these groups along with the research, tech and delivery teams are energized and fully focused on flawless execution in 2011. This is key to continuing to expand the depth and size of member relationships. Finally, investing in world-class talent at all levels of the organization remains the top priority. The greatest strength of The Advisory Board continues to be our outstanding and committed employee base of 1,300 employees across nine offices. As we kick off 2011, we are incredibly focused on attracting, developing, engaging and retaining exceptional people. The new talent we've brought into the firm over the last year has added depth and experience to our batch, and our growth has provided new and expanded opportunities for those already with us. As industry transforms and with it our firm grows and evolves, our employees recognize and are motivated by the opportunities before them to have a real impact on healthcare and education, contribute to a dynamic growing business and develop on a personal and professional level. I continue to be extremely impressed with the talent, commitment and energy of employees and I'm enormously proud to have such a high caliber team working each day with our members to drive performance improvements and tangible impact. As I look ahead, our talent gives me great confidence in our prospects this year and into the future. Thank you for joining today's call. We'll now open up the line for some questions."

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Please proceed. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you. Good evening. I'm Robert Musslewhite, CEO of the Advisory Board Company. And I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. This, our February call, is in many ways our most important call each year. In today’s discussion, we recap our full calendar year results which, because we operate the business on a calendar year basis, gives the most complete reflection of our overall performance. It is also our moment of greatest visibility into our forward growth, with over 85% of our revenue fully visible for the upcoming year. Thus, we are also providing our guidance for the upcoming calendar year at this time. We have a three-part agenda for this evening’s call. First, I will give you a summary of our quarter and calendar year ended December 31, 2011, covering our financial results and the drivers of our business performance. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials and other key performance metrics, as well as our guidance for calendar year 2012. Finally, I will close with updates on our strategic and operational priorities for the year ahead. Of course, as always, we’ll be happy to take questions at the end of the call. Revenue for the quarter increased 33% to $100 million from $75.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2010. Net income was $8.1 million or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $3.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.3 million for the quarter, compared to $11.6 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2010. On a calendar year basis, revenue increased 27% to $351.8 million from $276.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Adjusted EBITDA was up 29% at $63.1 million for the year compared to $48.8 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. Contract value grew 29% to $386 million as of December 31, 2011, up from $300.2 million as of December 31, 2010. We are very pleased with our strong performance for the quarter and the calendar year. Our results demonstrate that we have the right formula for success: delivery of outstanding member value, thoughtful scaling of programs and relationships and strategic investments in future growth. As hospitals and health systems continue to wrestle with enormous change and complexity in their markets, they are not only consistently relying on us to provide comprehensive solutions to their most pressing problems, but also realizing tremendous value from their Advisory Board memberships. Both our outstanding product quality and our deeper, more meaningful relationships with members today are the direct result of our investments over the last several years in expanding our capabilities to meet member needs. Based on member input on how we can best serve them, we have launched 4 to 5 new programs each year, enhanced our technology platform and delivery resources, made several strategic acquisitions, and expanded also the Crimson platform. We’ve also built on our sales and marketing infrastructure and continued to invest in attracting, engaging, developing and retaining world-class talent. It is incredibly exciting to see these investments bear fruit, and we enter the new year well-positioned for ongoing member-impacting growth. In fact, based on our strong top and bottom line growth in calendar 2011 as well as the inherent visibility of our business model, we expect 2012 to be another year of strong revenue growth and margin expansion, with visibility into another year of revenue growth exceeding 20% and earnings growth exceeding 25%. Importantly, even with these expanding margins, we’re also still making a number of important investments in the business to set up future revenue growth to continue our rapid growth and expansion years into the future. Of course, driving meaningful impact on our members’ most critical and most complex problems continues to be the fundamental building block of our business. To ensure that we are focused on the right issues, we constantly gather feedback from the membership through both formal tools, such as membership polls and new product development interviews, and the many individual member interactions that we have each day. Dominating these conversations today is the shift from a fee-for-service environment that is still contributing to members’ bottom lines to a value-based care models where the path to profitability is less straightforward and requires the development of new capabilities. Accordingly, our work across the portfolio has focused on providing members with tools to successfully prepare for and navigate this change. For example, in our research memberships, our team recently published a study evaluating the impact of five key payment reforms: value-based purchasing, readmissions penalties, bundled payment, shared savings and medical home reimbursement. This study summarizes the most important financial aspects of accountable care and risk-based contracting, provides guidance for finance executives who will determine how to approach them, and includes case studies from early adopters, financial models and implementation advice for each payment reform. In our Software business, our Payer Integrity Performance program provides the tool that hard-wires best-practice workflow intervention, advanced payment calculations, and sophisticated payer contract modeling to halt revenue leakage. Notably, the tool was also able to process physician revenue cycle data and contracts, making it uniquely positioned to integrate the facility and professional revenue cycle, which will become increasingly important as the market continues moving towards new payment mechanisms that bundle physician and hospital payments together. We’ve also expanded our services offerings to help members succeed in this transitioning market. The addition of Southwind physician practice management has proven critical, as hospitals seek to more effectively work with affiliated and owned practices, while our investment in Evolent Health helps bring to bear integrative population management along with key services to support health systems in their preparation to accept and manage all forms of value-based care reimbursement. Across all of this work, one key lesson is clear: the physician is of particular importance under value- based care models. Physician alignment has always been a cornerstone of successful hospital strategy, and the demands of value-based care have brought this into even higher relief. New payment models are inherently integrative, requiring hospitals and physicians to work together in order to optimize clinical outcomes and maximize financial performance. Shared culture, shared commitment to evidence-based care, shared responsibility for clinical outcomes and shared financial success must all be advanced to eliminate many of the silos that characterize the delivery and financing of care today. These aims have been a guiding focus as we have augmented our portfolio, and we have had outstanding impact. One story serves to illustrate. One of our member hospitals in the Northeast was having tremendous trouble with psychiatrists. The department had a significant number of cases with above-average resource utilization and lengths of stay. This was having a negative impact on the hospital’s financials. Through its Crimson position management software membership, the hospital identified the issue and leveraged Crimson to support a multipronged approach aimed at engaging the physicians to improve performance. The initiatives included enfranchising physicians to maximize the efficiency of clinical protocols for alcohol and drug withdrawal patients, and streamlining discharge planning for psychoses patients to reduce average length of stay. As a result of the cooperative work between the hospital and physicians, work made possible by the institution of Crimson membership, the psychiatric department percentage of cases with above-average length of stay went down by more than 16%. Further, the average cost per case of psychiatric patients went down by $2,014 per case, an impact of over $1 million in annualized savings. This was a gratifying success for our team, and it’s just one of the many examples where we’ve successfuly engaged physicians to meaningfully improve performance. Given the depth of our intellectual assets focused on the physician role in today’s market transformation, I'm particularly pleased to announced our newest program launch, the Physician Practice Roundtable, a renewable research membership program that equips independent physician organizations with the strategic insights and practical tools needed to elevate their clinical, operational and financial performance. As with hospitals and health systems, medical groups who wish to remain financially solvent in the future must look beyond managing solely their fee-for-service performance aims and instead ready their organizations for success under value-based payment. In support of this challenging reality, the Physician Practice Roundtable offers new best-practice case studies, tactical resources and road-tested toolkits to help independent physician organizations develop the efficiencies required in today’s marketplace. At the same time, the program provides physician groups unparalleled insight into how hospitals and health systems are thinking about organizational strategy, service line management, and physician alignment. It is at this intersection that physician groups derive the most benefit for membership, gaining access to resources critical for continued success of independent organizations while also gaining improved ability to evaluate and execute future partnerships in a rapidly-evolving healthcare market. The Physician Practice Roundtable is off to an outstanding start. Early feedback from members includes comments like, “You go beyond the definition of the new healthcare laws to provide a detailed understanding of how organizations like ours are addressing this strategic challenge,” and, “Your team has a different way of looking at things, and that’s just the kind of help and support we need.” And finally, “We are very pleased with all of the resources. Our physicians and staff are much better educated on the current healthcare trends and topics as a result of our membership. This is just what we needed for the challenges of today.” The Physician Practice Roundtable augments our ability to serve physician practices and will be, we believe, a great beachhead with this very important constituency. As we deepen our relationships with this segment, we will enhance our opportunity to cross-sell other programs to them, such as our payment navigation performance program, Crimson practice management, and multiple training- and development- focused membership programs. The Physician Practice Roundtable is an exciting addition to our portfolio and we look forward to its continued success. Before I turn the call over to Michael, some of you might have seen our recent 8-K filing about the sale of our OptiLink business, and I thought it might be worth providing some context for the decision. In the time since we initially acquired OptiLink, the market for its product, installed acuity and workforce productivity software, has evolved significantly. Today there is a much greater premium on integration with scheduling functionality. So when Kronos, a worldwide leader in scheduling, approached us about the business, we thought it worth evaluating their offer. After extensive diligence, we completed the sale with the conviction that Kronos’ commitment to healthcare, strong service offerings and value proposition make it a great home for OptiLink. Both OptiLink customers and OptiLink employees reacted favorably to the transaction as well, citing Kronos’ strong reputation and the centrality of the OptiLink capability to its strategy in the healthcare sector. We will have a continuing relationship with Kronos going forward and feel good about the deal. With that, let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail and to provide our guidance for calendar year 2012. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I’ve organized today’s financial review around six categories: income statement, the balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, the divestiture of our OptiLink product, and outlook for calendar year 2012. First, the income statement. A quick reminder, we’re on a March 31 fiscal year-end, which means we just finished the third quarter fiscal year 2012. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 33% to $100 million, up from $75.2 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending December 31, 2011 increased 67% to $19.3 million, up from $11.6 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted net income was $10.6 million compared to $6.7 million last year, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.61 compared to $0.40 last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarters ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 exclude transaction-related costs and amortization, equity and income of an unconsolidated entity, gain on investment and common stock warrants, as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including transaction cost related and amortization, equity and income of an unconsolidated entity, gains on investment and common stock warrants, as well as share-based compensation expense, GAAP net income and income per diluted share in the quarter ending December 31, 2011, were $8.1 million and $0.46, respectively. Cost of services for the quarter increased to $54.2 million or 54.2% of revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 compared to $41.2 million or 54.8% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in the cost of services are due to increased expense for our new and growing programs, primarily related to our physician products as well as newly-incorporated costs from our recent acquisition of Pivot Health. Member relations and marketing expense was $18.4 million or 18.4% of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2011 compared to $17.1 million or 22.7% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. We currently have 146 sales teams in place, an increase from the 133 sales teams in place as of December 31, 2010. G&A expense increased to $12.4 million or 12.4% of revenue in the quarter December 31, 2011, compared to $9.7 million or 13% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year, due primarily to an increase in personnel costs and infrastructure investment in our IT, legal and finance functions to support our growing employee base. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $2.2 million or 2.2% of revenue compared to $1.5 million or 2% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year, due to increased amortization and capital investments in our growing technology programs. Other income net in the quarter was $1.6 million compared to $480,000 in the same quarter the prior year. This quarter’s other income net consists of a gain in the value of common stock warrants of [$4.1 million] related to the sales of one of our [indiscernible] programs, as well as interest income of $596,000, and the loss of $71,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. During the quarter ended December 31, 2010, we had interest income of $469,000 and a gain of $11,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to our fiscal year-to-date income statement results, for the nine months ending December 31, 2011, revenue increased 28.9% to $274.6 million, up from $213 million last year. GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the nine months ending December 31, 2011, were $17.1 million and $1, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $51.1 million, $28.7 million and $1.67, respectively, for the nine months ending December 31, 2011, compared to $36 million, $21 million and $1.29, respectively, for the same quarter in the previous fiscal year. For the full calendar year 2011, our revenue was $351.8 million, an increase of 27.3% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $63.1 million, an increase of 29.1% over the prior year, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.11, an increase of 19.2% over the prior year. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased $257 million as of December 31, 2011, compared to $196 million as of December 31, 2010. Gross DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables, were 231 days as of December 31, 2011, and were 211 days as of December 31, 2010. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs on billed A/ R were 50 days as of December 31, 2011, down from 51 days as of December 31, 2010, due to improved collections. Deferred revenue net of amounts we billed after 12 months increased to $371.9 million as of December 31, 2011, up from $274.6 million as of December 31, 2010. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2011, was $306.5 million, up 38% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ended December 31, 2011, our cash generated from operating activities was $30.2 million compared to $24.6 million in the same quarter last year. For the nine months ending December 31, 2011, cash flow generated from operations was $67.2 million, up from $33.6 million in the prior fiscal year. For calendar year 2011, we generated cash flow from operations of $84 million or 2.3 times adjusted net income, compared to $52.8 million or 1.9 times adjusted net income for calendar 2010. For calendar 2012, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be approximately 1.5 to 2 times adjusted net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ended December 31, 2011, were approximately $9.8 million, compared to $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2010. This increase is due to the increased levels of investment associated with our analytic tools program this year as well as $3.5 million of expenditures related to build-out of additional floors in both our Washington, D.C., and Austin, Texas, office spaces. For the three months ended December 31, 2011, we repurchased $1.9 million of stocks for approximately 28,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $323 million or approximately 7.6 million shares. As of December 31, 2011, the remaining authorized repurchase was $27 million. As of December 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $152.9 million, representing approximately $8.75 per diluted share. As to contract value, our contract value increased 28.8% to $386.6 million as of December 31, 2011, up from $300.2 million as of December 31, 2010. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months in contract value. Turning to the sale of OptiLink, in January 2012, we sold substantially all of the assets in our OptiLink business to Kronos Incorporated for cash. The OptiLink business, which is headquartered in a suburb of Portland, Oregon, and involved approximately 35 employees, generated approximately $6.4 million of revenue, $700,000 of income from operations, and $1.5 million in adjusted EBITDA during calendar year 2011. The company expects to record a gain in transaction of approximately $3.5 million fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2012. Now with respect to the outlook for calendar year 2012, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor Provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on our preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2012, we expect revenue to be in the range of approximately $420 million to $430 million. This represents revenue growth of approximately 21.5% to 24.5% when compared to calendar 2011, excluding discontinued operations of OptiLink from calendar 2011. We expect year-over-year revenue growth for calendar 2012 to be front-weighted, given the increased service revenues in the second half of the year, primarily due to our acquisition of Pivot Health in August of 2011. Overall for calendar 2012, we expect consistent quarter-over-quarter sequential revenue growth across the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA for calendar 2012 to be in the range of approximately $77 million to $82 million. This represents growth of approximately 25% to 33% when compared to calendar 2011, excluding discontinued operations from OptiLink from calendar 2011. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $2.40 to $2.60. For calendar 2012, we expect shared-based compensation expense to be approximately $13.5 million and expect depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately $17.5 million, which includes approximately $5 million from acquisition-related intangible assets. For calendar 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 38% to 38.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I’ll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about the year ahead, and then we’ll take any questions you have. As we enter 2012, we are poised for another year of rapid growth. This is an exciting time for us and we have tremendous opportunities ahead. In order to take advantage of them and to continue to enhance our impact on the industries we serve while also delivering superior financial results, we’re focused on innovation across all key areas of the organization. As I shared with our employees on our last firm-wide meeting, at this moment of success, it is more critical than ever that we continue to push ourselves transforming our own business just as the markets we serve are undergoing a transformation. In the meeting, I shared with employees a detailed innovation action plan, and thought it worth highlighting some of the key points tonight. First, deliver member value in new ways. Today we are working with many more member institutions through many more programs, and, as such, we must be innovative in order to be sure that we are always improving and delivering unique value through each of them. This is something that we never take for granted; rather, we continue to find new ways to enhance the research, software, service and impact we provide to members of all our programs. This paves the way for the relationship, stewardship and cultivation so key to our success. Second, continue our relentless focus on growth. Here we must innovate to meet member needs in new ways through new programs. Today’s market complexity and change continue to provide unprecedented opportunities to develop novel means of supporting our members. We are focused on operating with a clear vision of future market and member needs based on our extensive knowledge base, and rapidly taking advantage of opportunities with new product launches and extensions both organic and acquired. We are engaging the firm broadly in these efforts, encouraging participation at all levels to surface new ideas for new research, software and services. With individuals across the firm contributing to these efforts, I'm confident that new product development will continue to be a key driver of our growth. Third, strengthen our go-to market model. Our recent innovations in branding, website and logo have been incredibly impactful, as have our innovations to our commercial organization. As we enter 2012, we are focused on migrating to deeper and more powerful commercial relationships across our portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance relationship efforts and refining our strategic marketing and brand presentation. Fourth, enhance our organizational infrastructure and agility. With new businesses, new offices, a growing workforce and staff around the world, it is critical that we innovate to serve business needs well while at the same time driving scale. Our growth requires serious thought about internal processes, visibility, technology and communication. This is a key priority for me and for the leadership team. We are investing time to be sure that we are appropriately structured not just for the company that we are today, but for the company that we will become. Finally, we’re constantly focused on attracting, cultivating, engaging and retaining world-class talent. As our workforce has grown and continues to grow extremely rapidly, investing in this key asset has perhaps never been more important. Our successes, impact in the industry and future prospects make this a very exciting place to work, one with tremendous opportunities for advancement, new experience and outstanding skill development. As a result, employee engagement is at an all-time high. In addition, we are thrilled to be able to attract key hires that continue to build out our capabilities in a variety of roles and functions within the firm. Finally, we complement our growth culture and environment by continually enhancing training and development programs for employees at all levels. This both improves job satisfaction and builds our bench of future leaders across the company. As always, I'm extremely impressed with the talent, commitment and energy of our employees. In my conversations with members, they consistently make a point of praising our team, telling me how glad they are to have such high-caliber individuals working with them to drive performance improvement in measurable results. I'm grateful for their hard work and the impact that we collectively are having for our members and the industry at large. Thank you for participating in tonight’s call. We will now open up the line for your questions."

I'm Frank Williams, the Chairman and CEO of the Advisory Board and with me today are Robert Musslewhite, who many of you already know and who will move into the CEO position in September and Michael Kirschbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We're happy to report another strong quarter today and successful financial results for fiscal year 2008. We got a fair bit to cover this evening, so let me start with an overview of the agenda. First, I'll provide you with an update on our fourth quarter and fiscal year performance from both the financial and operational perspective. I'll also spend a little time touching on some of the key elements of our long term growth strategy. I will turn the call over to Michael who will go through a more detailed review of our financial performance, the repurchase announcement and other related financial items. I will then outline some of the organizational changes described in the press release including the transition plan for September and our early thoughts on the division of responsibilities between the executive chairman and CEO and then I'll turn it over to Robert for his comments on the transition and our plans for the remainder of 2008. Of course we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Advisory Board revenues were 57.9 million, 15.2% growth over the comparable quarter of the prior year. This performance was driven by strong renewal rates, consistent growth in our existing programs and the continued success of our new program launches. Net income was 8.5 million in the quarter with EPS for the quarter at $0.47 per diluted share. For our 2008 fiscal year that ended March 31, our revenue was 219 million, up 15.3% from the prior year's 189.8 million. Net income for the fiscal year was 32.1 million compared to 27.4 million in the prior year with fiscal year EPS up 22% to $1.72 per diluted share compared to $1.41 per diluted share in the prior year. As of March 31, 2008, we have grown our membership base to 2,761 institutions with average contract value per member increasing to $83,595. On an aggregate basis, our contract value as of March 31, 2008 is 230.8 million, representing growth of 15.3% over the prior year. In addition, we also achieved a member renewal rate of 90%, the second highest member renewal rate in our history. This is one of the most important metrics related to the overall health of our business and illustrates that our programs are consistently addressing our members' most important strategic and operational issues. As we have discussed in the past, the renewal rate is a leading indicator of product quality and member satisfaction as a critical factor in establishing our platform for future growth. Given the level of uncertainty in the overall economy, I wanted to take a moment to give you a sense of where our business is in terms of healthcare market we serve and our outlook going forward. There are four areas that I wanted to touch on. First, in terms of the overall environment, we have not seen any notable shift in our members' budget outlook as there has been in other sectors of the economy. Members continue to report that most of their up at night issues center on questions of growth, clinical quality and physicians' strategy rather than on a renewed focus on cost reduction tactics due to increasing budget pressure. Our 90% renewal rates stands as a strong sign of the need for best practices in our target markets in a tangible economic impact of our work. We are also hearing a tremendous amount of buzz and excitement over this year's research agendas and program services. We will continue to monitor the situation as the year progresses, but for now the healthcare market has been relatively stable. Second, we continue to see consistent execution of our long term growth strategy through price increases, adding new member institutions, cross-selling and new program launches. You can see the power of having multiple sources of growth and our performance over the last several years. In March of 2000, we had 1,988 members and average contract value of $29,200. Today we have grown the membership base to 2,761 institutions and almost triple the average contract value per member to $83,595. This still leaves us only a little over 11% penetrated in the context of our current $2 billion cross-sell opportunity and still a very small portion of our member spending on related professional services, a long way of saying that the strategy of pursuing multiple avenues of growth has worked and continues to have a lot of running room. Third, in terms of forward metrics, our contract value growth of 15.3% and deferred revenue growth net of long term, deferred, and pre-pays of 18% are consistent with our 15% revenue guidance for the year. A slight deceleration in contract value growth from the 16% range can be mostly attributed to the fact that we are increasingly entering into multiple-year contracts and our programs anchored by analytical tools. This change in the contracting approach, which establish as a long term relationship upfront, also causes the setup component of the membership fee to be spread across multiple years rather than just across the first year of membership. If you adjusted for the effect of multiple year contracts, contract value growth as well as revenue growth would be approximately 16%. Overall, despite its effect on current contract value, multiple year contracting is obviously great for the business because it enhances renewability with no impact on the cash characteristics of the business. Fourth, we are seeing heavy demand for our program anchored by analytical tools, which is creating a huge market opportunity as well as some pre-increased operational complexity. In some of our newer programs, nursing and bad debt in particular, demand has been higher than initially anticipated. This is causing us to stagger start dates and in some cases extend the term of the first year of membership to ensure that members are getting full value from program services. The net effect has been the delay revenue from the first half of 2008 into the second half of the year, which is reflected in our revenue guidance for the remainder of the calendar year. Again, we have very good visibility regarding the revenue stream, but it's also more back weighted as a result. Improving our effective capacity to meet member expectations has been one of our top operational priorities over the last quarter and I am confident that we will return to more standard pacing over the coming months. From an organization perspective, the talent base and labor market is strong and operationally we need to continue to prepare the organization for growth and scale as we have over the last several years. So that’s the state of the union as I now see it and I will keep you updated if any of these factors change moving forward. Building on that quick snapshot of the business, I thought I'd also touch on the key elements of our long term growth strategy. If you think about where we sit today, we are in an outstanding position for future growth and I see four major areas of opportunity before us. Our first opportunity lies in expanding our services to what is currently our largest customer base, the US hospital sector. Given the market forces acting on this sector, there has never been a greater need for what we do. Employers, managed care organizations and the government are all demanding improved performance and greater transparency from hospitals on key cost, quality, and operational metrics, and we offer a unique shared research model that provides very high value at a much lower cost than traditional professional service alternatives. Our average member still only spends on average $83,595 across a handful of our 37 programs. So there is a significant opportunity to expand member relationships through the addition of new programs. It's striking to consider that if we were to triple the average contract value per member to $250,000 over the next several years, we would still be less than half the cost of one consulting engagement in one terrain from a strategy or healthcare consulting firm. One area worth noting in our core hospital market is our programs anchored with robust analytics. These programs, which represent nine of our 37 memberships, have proven to be incredibly powerful in driving value to the member because they deliver insight right to the desktop and assist in hardwiring best practices across large, diffuse, and highly complex organizations. Critical to our ability to develop analytical tools of such value is our larger research asset, which provides us a unique understanding of the right answers to our members' most important questions. Further, as our members use the tools, they are reporting back high impact intangible ROI. If the number of users of each tool increases, each individual member derives great value from the data contributed as the benchmarking cohort becomes increasingly robust. This cycle also creates an extraordinary data asset for us, which feeds back into our research and significantly expands our available market. So when I think about our growth opportunities, I still have a lot of excitement about those before us in the core US Hospital market. The second area of long term growth opportunity for us is the international market. Currently a convergence of events is making healthcare best practices very relevant in other areas around the world including Europe, the far East, Australia, and the Middle East. To take the US as just one example, the recent trends there towards increased transparency, freedom of patient choice, and consumerism along with a movement towards pay for performance program erratically changing the landscape for the administrators of the government run NHS Trust. In the phase of this disorienting change, these executives are seeking expertise on these topics and our deep knowledge base and current research agendas are right on point. Interesting changes like these are happening around the globe creating a huge opportunity to use our existing research to drive value to a target market of 1 to 2,000 large and progressive international institutions. Third area of opportunity is leveraging our deep knowledge of providers and physicians along with our expanding data asset to reach other sectors within healthcare. We have a growing business serving healthcare related businesses ranging from medical technology and pharmaceutical companies to nursing home companies and architecture firms. These desperate organizations are joining our memberships because no one else can offer them our depth of expertise and network of relationships with over 60,000 healthcare executives that can really impact their businesses. Our fourth main area of opportunity is expanding our presence within our new vertical and education. Education is a large and important sector of the US and worldwide economy. In fact, in the US alone, post- secondary education is a $320 billion industry with more than 6,000 institutions and 18 million students. These organizations share many characteristics with our core healthcare market and because of these similarities, we are in a great position to apply our experience and existing knowledge base in this new segment. Our launches in this terrain, the student affairs program and the University Provost Program have gotten great traction in the marketplace and we are already demonstrating an ability to serve this sector at a very high standard. As we look ahead, we see a number of additional program opportunities within this vertical especially on the academic side of these organizations and our team is quite excited about our work in this terrain. So that gives you a good sense of the opportunity in front of us and provides a framework for our growth plan over the next several years. In that context, I'd like to comment on our acquisition of Crimson and our new program launch. We are excited to announce the acquisition of Crimson, a boutique provider of data, analytics and business intelligence software to health systems and physician organizations. Crimson's product aggregates data and applies sophisticated proprietary algorithms to help providers elevate performance on quality and cost of care outcomes. Crimson's strong base of satisfied customers including Memorial Hermann Healthcare, Baylor Health Care System, Scott & White, Singing River Hospital System and Mission Hospitals have renewed at a rate of 100% over the last three years and report outstanding results. From The Advisory Board's perspective, I'm excited about the acquisition for four reasons. First, Crimson has the best and brief product in analytics platform that we'll be able to introduce immediately through our membership. Given the current importance of clinical quality issues to our member executives, acquiring Crimson's Proprietary Tool allows us to make a timely entry into our high priority area for the membership. Further, because of the tools position orientation, it provides a new opportunity to expand our addressable market into the physician practice setting with IPAs and large medical groups where Crimson already has had some success Second, the Crimson business has an incredible strategic fit with our existing analytical tools platform in our growth strategy. Not only does Crimson share the renewability and scalability characteristics of our membership model, we also anticipate that its proprietary algorithms and technologies will inform some of our new analytics tools going forward. In addition, Crimson's platform creates a powerful national dataset so we can benchmark member's performance on key healthcare value metrics as well as feed key data into our own research process. Third, the acquisition gives us a strong management team that will deepen our expertise with technology and provide strong operational capabilities. Finally, we anticipate strong long-term financial returns as we are able to take Crimson's analytical capabilities in combination with The Advisory Board's best practices to our current membership of 2700 organizations and establish a leading product offering in a very large market segment. Turning now to our new program launch activities, I am pleased today to announce the launch of our new program for the emergency department, a highly complex department that accounts for over 40% of inpatient admissions and a significant of direct hospital contribution profit. We did a research feedback from Emergency Department Directors the program offers a comprehensive approach to improving the operational and financial performance of the emergency department. Through best practice research and a robust web-based analytical tool, emergency department performance program aims to hardwire optimum performance in emergency department management by improving the ability of the ED Medical Directors to surface problems and making more strategic and informed decisions of the front-line. As always this program has benefitted from the advice and guidance of a stellar group of charter members including Spectrum Health Hospitals, Providence Hospitals, O'Connor Hospitals, Medical Center of Central Georgia, and Western Jefferson Medical Center. We are very excited about its potential. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael Kirschbaum Thanks Frank. I've organized today's financial review around six categories. Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, overview of the Crimson acquisition, and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2008. First, the income statement; a quick reminder that we're on a March 31, fiscal year end which means we just finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 15.2% to 57.9 million, up from 50.3 million in the same period last year. Income from operations increased 23.8% to 11.4 million, compared to 9.2 million in the same period last year. Net income was 8.5 million, an increase of 18.9% over 7.2 million in the prior year. Earnings per diluted share increased 23.7% to $0.47 per diluted share, up from $0.38 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Cost of services for the quarter decreased to 47.5% of revenue compared to 48.3% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year due to shifting timing of budgeted personnel and partner expenses within the calendar year as compared to calendar year 2007. Member relations and marketing expense was 21.1% of revenue compared to 20.7% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. Increase in total expenses attributable to our headcount growth mainly in sales teams as we currently have 109 sales teams employees compared to 95 in March 2007 as well as our investment in our sales force management infrastructure. G&A expense in the quarter decreased to 10% of revenue compared to 11.5% of revenue same for the prior year due to scaling our administrative cost over a larger revenue base. Depreciation expense in the quarter increased to 1.7% of revenue compared to 1.2% of revenue in the same quarter last year. The increase in depreciation is from the amortization of capitalized cost related to the development of analytic tools for some of our newer programs as well as costs associated with last years build up of additional expansion space in our DC Headquarters. And moving on to our fiscal year end income statement results. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2008, revenues increased 15.3% to 290 million, up from 189.8 million last year. Income from operations in 12 months ending March 31, 2008 increased 21.1% to 41.9 million compared to 34.6 million last year. Net income was 32.1 million, an increase of 17% over 27.4 million last year and earnings per diluted share increased 22% to $1.72 per diluted share, up from $1.41 per diluted share last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long term receivables, increased to 81.5 million as of March 31, 2008 versus 57.7 million as of March 31, 2007. DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables, were 137 days in the quarter ended March 2008, up from 133 days last quarter and 116 days in March 2007. Excluding receivables associated with revenue from multiyear contracts that will be recognized beyond 12 months, DSOs were 122 days in the quarter ended March 31 of 2008 compared to 121 days last quarter and 113 days in the quarter ended March 31, 2007. The increase in DSOs is due to continued strong performance in some of our higher price point programs, which include more product sellings as well as the increase in multi year contracts described above. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we built after 12 months, increased 23.2% to 144.1 million as of March 31, 2008, up from 117 million as of March 31, 2007. Excluding pre-paid contracts and long term deferred, deferred revenue balances as of March 31, 2008 was 131.7 million, up 17.9% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow. During the three months ended March 31, 2008, we generated 21.7 million in cash from operating activities compared to 21 million generated in the same quarter last year. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008, cash flow generated from operations was 60.3 million, an increase of 20% over 50.2 million generated last year. Cash flow from operations is 1.9 times net income for fiscal year 2008 compared to 1.8 times net income for fiscal 2007. For fiscal year 2009, we continue to expect cash flow from operations to be approximately one-and-half to two times net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2008 were approximately $2.9 million, of which 2.5 million was related to the capitalized development and hardware associated with analytic tools included in some of our newer programs. For the three months ended March 31, 2008, we repurchased $46.7 million of stock or approximately 822,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchases to-date to $242.5 million or approximately 5.1 million shares. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and our Board of Directors has recently authorized an additional $100 million under the share repurchase plan. As of March 31, 2008, our cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances were approximately $150.1 million. Contract value increased to 230.8 million as of March 31, 2008, up 15.3% from 200.1 million as of March 31, 2007. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. If the contract is more than 12 months durations, we include only 12 months in contract value. Now turning to Crimson. The company has also announced that we have entered into an agreement to purchase all outstanding shares of Crimson, a provider of data and analytic tools to hospitals, health systems and physician clinics. The purchase price, net of acquired cash, will be approximately 23 million broken down as roughly 18 million in cash and 5 million in stock. There is also a small earn out that will be added to purchase price if certain business performance conditions are met. We expect the Crimson acquisition to be approximately $0.10 dilutive to earnings for calendar year 2008 and break-even to slightly accretive to earnings in calendar 2009. On a cash basis, we expect the acquisition to be break-even in fiscal 2009 and accretive next fiscal year. Crimson currently has existing contracts that provide annual revenue of approximately $309 million. Given that these are multi year service contracts, the deferred revenue from these contracts will be written down to fair value and the incremental revenue from existing Crimson contracts will be minimal in calendar year 2008. This write-down will obviously have no impact on cash flow. We expect to close the transaction within 30 days. With respect to the remainder of calendar year 2008, the following comments are intended to fall into the Safe Harbor provision outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions, which are subjected to change over time. For calendar year 2008, we are reiterating our full year revenue guidance for approximately 243 million and for the June quarter we expect revenue in the range of approximately 56.7 million to $57.7 million. We expect our revenues to be more back weighted to the back half of calendar 2008 compared to calendar year 2007 due to two factors which is Frank touched on earlier. First we've been increasingly entering into multi-year contracts in analytic tools program. Well this has a very positive effect of locking in renewals and pricing for a longer period of time and causes a short-term shift in the timing of accrual revenue as we spread the set up fee over the life of the contract instead of just the first year. This has no impact on our cash flow as we still collect the set up fee up front. Since we moved more aggressively to this practice in the second half of calendar year 2007 the impact has been to shift the accrual revenue out of the first half of calendar year 2008 and into the second half of the calendar year. The second factor is the high demand of two of our analytic tools programs that Frank mentioned earlier. As a result of this demand in some instances we have decided to stagger membership starts and offer longer membership terms to ensure that our members have enough time to get the most benefit possible from the tool. As mentioned above we expect this to cause revenue to be back weighted in calendar 2008. Most of these factors contribute to our increasing deferred revenue growth which is up 23% over the prior year on a gross basis and up 18% net of long term deferred, on top of strong comparables from the prior year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for calendar year 2008 excluding the impact from the Crimson acquisition, we are increasing our guidance from $1.86 to $1.87 due to the strong performance in the first calendar quarter. As mentioned earlier, we expect Crimson acquisition to be approximately $0.10 dilutive to earnings, therefore our earnings per diluted share guidance for calendar year including the dilutive effect of the acquisition is $1.77. Included in this calendar year 2008 earnings per diluted share estimate is approximately $0.45 to $0.48 per share based compensation related expense for the year as we have slightly changed the mix between equity and cash and cash incentive compensation. We expect income from operations for calendar year 2008 to be approximately $43.4 million. Given the large portion of the dilution from the Crimson acquisition due to the amortization of intangible assets and lost interest income, we expect EBITDA margins for calendar year 2008 including the effect of the acquisition to be roughly the same as they were in calendar 2007 of approximately 20.3% of revenue. For the June quarter of calendar year 2008, we expect earnings per diluted share of $0.34 inclusive of the impact of the Crimson acquisition. This concludes the Financial Summary. I'll now turn things back over to Frank. Frank Williams Thanks, Michael, now a few words on our executive promotions. As you all read in our Press Release we announced effective September 1st, Robert Musslewhite will step into the CEO role and David Felsenthal will become President. I will remain as Executive Chairman. The timing of the decision was related to three factors. First is Robert's strong performance and steep trajectory, his energy, focus on innovation and unique leadership style give me great confidence in his ability to lead the firm. Second, I've increasingly wanted to direct my focus primarily to the growth strategy, business development with our most progressive members and relationship building with key industry players. Third and important as well, I have a need to be based out of San Francisco for personal family related reasons. I will remain intensely focussed on the business and look forward to a very productive partnership with Robert and David. For those of you who do not already know Robert, he joined us almost five years ago from McKenzie and ran our growth strategy and new product development group before broadening his responsibility to run program operations, member services, and sales and marketing for a significant portfolio of the company's membership programs. Robert's leadership in these roles has highlighted his exceptional strategic thinking, his innovation, his deep understanding of our business, his dedication to our mission, and his appreciation for our employees' talent and hard work. I'm very pleased that he will move into the CEO role in the coming months and I'm also excited about David Felsenthal's promotion to President. David's contribution as CFO and COO has been extraordinary, and he will be an incredible partner for Robert in driving continued strong performance across all aspects of the business. Given the strength of the entire leadership team, our unique combination of assets, and the large growth opportunity in front of us, I remain very confident in our ability on what is already an exceptional track record of performance. With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Robert. Robert Musslewhite Frank, I'm very excited by the opportunity to assume day to day leadership of The Advisory Board later this year and I look forward to continuing in building on our great partnership. It is an honor to have the support from you, the board, and our close to 1000 employees, who are all focussed on delivering exceptional value to our base of over 2700 members. I also feel that the transition plan has been well thought out and allows for great deal of continuity and leadership at a time when we are executing well against our long-term growth strategy. As a result, I am confident that the entire team will remain focused on the four strategic priorities we have established for 2008 and into the future. First, to continue to provide relevant, timely and actionable research data and tools to our members. One recent example of our strong execution on this priority is our clinical operations programs 2008 national meeting series, which launched earlier this month. The agenda for the series focuses on the joint optimization challenge of balancing investments in both quality and efficiency and helps to bolstering hospital performance over the long term. This strong 3.86 TPA the sessions received at the opening meeting is a testament to the quality of the research and timeliness of the topic. This type of work is going on across all of our programs and we are continually investing to ensure that all of our research is on point and provides proven best practices to address members' most important strategic and operational issues. Second, to continue to focus on driving our research deeper into each organization to support our members' critical operational and strategic decision making. Our ability to make our research immediately relevant to a large number of executives at each member institution increases the value members derive from the programs and ultimately impact their decision to renew with us. One exciting current project in pursuit of this goal is our exploration of new ways to work with our expanding data asset. We are testing ways of using this data that will engage more individuals at each member institution and embed our research even more deeply into the members' daily workflows. This type of creativity is evident throughout the organization and makes me very confident that we will continue to execute well against this priority. Third, to continue to execute on our new program development strategy. Having focused much of my time in this area personally over the last five years, I am deeply engaged with this aspect of our business. We have an outstanding team working on this strategy and an unparalleled foundation to build upon. I am very excited about our current pipeline of new program possibilities and given our prudent launch process, I am confident that we will continue our track record of bringing successful new programs to market. Finally, to build a scalable organization with top talent. This is an ongoing priority for our Board, our executive team, and managers throughout our ranks. As always, this past quarter we continued to scale our direct sales force inline with our plans for the year with a 109 teams currently in place, up from 95 at this time last year. Total Advisory Board headcount now stands at 910 people and our research staff is now over 530. We continue to invest heavily in developing and training our staff and now offer an extensive curriculum of learning opportunities through our Advisory Board University. The depth of our talent is truly one of our differentiators and one of the reasons I am most excited is step into the CEO role. With the outstanding leadership and the potential I see at all levels of the organization, I know we have in place the building blocks for ongoing growth and success. With that, let me turn it back to Frank. Frank Williams Thanks Robert. Robert, Michael and I plan to be on the road, meeting with investors over a number of days across May and early June and look forward to giving an update on the business and our priorities for the coming year. With that, why don’t we take time now to answer your questions."

This is Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evenings call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter, and for our fiscal year which ended March 31, 2009, covering our financial results, discussing the broader market environment, and announcing our most recent new program launch. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. Finally, I will close with an update on our key operational and strategic priorities. As always, we will be happy to take questions at the end of the session. Let me start with our financial results. In the quarter ended March 31, 2009, Advisory Board revenues were $56.2 million, versus $57.9 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Net income was $3.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to $8.5 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. EBITDA, excluding foreign currency loss was $7.7 million for the quarter, compared to $12.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. For the year ended March 31, 2009, revenue increased 5% to $230.4 million, from $219 million for the year ended March 31, 2008. Net income for the year ended March 31, 2009 was $21.5 million or $1.30 per diluted share, compared to $32.1 million or $1.72 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. At the conclusion of the March quarter, our contract value stood at $230.8 million, constant versus last year at the same time, and we have grown our membership base to 2,817 institutions. Putting those together, our average contract value per member was $81,920. In addition, we also achieved a member renewal rate of 88%, well within our historical range of 86% to 90%. Our overall performance for both the quarter and the fiscal year were in line with our expectations, given the current macroeconomic environment, and we're reiterating the outlook for the calendar year that we provided on our February call. In addition, we are pleased that our overall renewal rate for the year of 88% was well within our historical range, and that we increased the number of Advisory Board members, both of which served to illustrate the strong value we continue to deliver through our on-point research agendas, proven best practices and superior services. While our members are still experiencing budget pressure and uncertainty, we remain highly focused on executing at a high standard, including communicating and delivering strong financial returns for our program, driving superior sales and account management performance, improving efficiency across our operations, and developing mission-critical new programs that provide large rapid returns around the key pain points of the membership. In terms of the broader environment, as we expected, we continue to see a challenging market across the last quarter. Our members still face a difficult operating environment, and maintain an uncertain outlook in the face of the upcoming July budget season. As a result, they're scrutinizing every dollar that they spend, making us work harder for each new unit and renewal. While the environment this quarter was challenging across the board, we continued to see performance variations by program consistent with the patterns we saw in the prior quarter. In general, core strategy operations research programs, analytical tool programs oriented at specific margin related issues, and the education practice continued to perform relatively well, while programs oriented around leadership development, our higher price point installation support programs, and our workforce and nursing oriented research programs continued to fare less we will. Looking ahead, we project that both new business and renewals will continue to be challenging throughout the remainder of the year, and as a result, we have redoubled our efforts at ensuring that we are consistently delivering on-point research agendas, proven best practices and measurable impact for our members. If there's a silver lining of the current environment, it is that our members need our guidance now more than ever, and we're working hard to capitalize on the opportunity that this presents. The healthcare industry is facing tremendous complexity, and we're demonstrating each day that we can provide measurable impact on our members' most important strategic and operational issues. Let me share a few examples. Each year, one of the highlights of our research calendar is our series of interactive discussion-based sessions for member CEOs, focused on the hottest topics and our most ground breaking research. This year's agenda covers our analysis of the short and long-term implications of the recession and the recent movement towards healthcare reform on hospital and health system economics. These roundtables are very execution focused. A highlight of the meeting is our recession playbook which provides 65 best practices for responding to the downturn, from rationalizing expenses in a principled manner, to boosting growth prospects in a low-demand market. Response from our members to the material has been fantastic, garnering a meeting GPA of 3.86. Speaking with CEOs in attendance and reviewing their evaluations of the meeting, it was gratifying to hear and see comments like, the meeting provided good data and original content. It demonstrates how relevant and valuable the Advisory Board is to the performance of my organization. The CEO roundtables are the culmination of the first phase of our ongoing multi-disciplinary campaign to provide an aggressive response to member concerns about the economy. The initiative has been incredibly well received overall and our members are very enthusiastic about the concrete value that they are receiving from it. The story of one recent member renewal shows just how much impact this work is having. With a new executive team recently [emceed] this health system was making large budget cuts on all outside spending, including evaluating their advisory board relationship. We used our economy book as materials to anchor a dialogue with them during which we diagnosed their specific areas of need and opportunity in today's environment. It quickly became clear that this member's biggest performance lever would be short-term volume growth and we were able to immediately direct them to our 100-day volume campaign toolkit. This resource provided structured support for their most critical need and they used it along with our inpatient and outpatient demand forecasters and physician demand assessment to drive specific near-term actions to capture incremental volume. As a result, the system realized significant value, and the executives decided not only to renew their memberships, but also to expand their membership portfolio by three programs and increase the contract value by over 40%. It is stories like this particularly in today's environments that illustrate just how meaningful our economy-focused work has been. From accelerating revenue capture to reigning in labor costs, to expediting patient throughput to a whole host of other imperatives, our definitive framework helps members understand all the levers for improved performance, diagnose their own needs and access our deep reserve of resources for inflecting performance in the way that will be most meaningful for them. The economy is not the only issue keeping our members up at night. Further increasing the complexity they face is the dizzying pace of changes across the policy landscape, from the federal stimulus bill, to nascent healthcare reform efforts. Here, too, we have been nimble in our response. For example, less than two weeks after the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, otherwise known as the Obama Stimulus Plan, we had developed extensive resources to assist our members, including a policy memo and member teleconference that covered the implications of the $19 billion in incentives for hospital and health system IT strategy and investment. Shortly thereafter, we unveiled an online calculator that estimates the maximum incentive payments our members might receive from the program. Finally, we have launched a specific research initiative to identify the crucial steps hospital and health system leaders must take today to prepare for a potentially very different future under healthcare reform, one in which continuous care of the chronically ill may displace acute interventions with expensive technology, as the measure of value in the healthcare system. Early feedback from our members indicates that our analysis here has been more comprehensive, relevant, and accurate than that of any other organization, association, or vendor offering information in this terrain. Also, members indicated that they see a real role for us to play in helping them through additional reform related products and tools in the future. Along those lines, let me now turn to our most recent launch, which grew out of another policy imperative that is an up at night issue for our members. This year's national rollout of CMS's largest cost saving initiative in two decades, the Recovery Audit Contractor, or RAC program. Created in 2003 as part of the Medicare Modernization Act, the RAC program is designed to identify and recover improper Medicare payments made to healthcare providers. Through a five-state demonstration project, RAC contractors have already identified and recovered more than $1 billion in overpayments in just three years. The vast majority coming from inpatient providers. Given that some hospitals in the demonstration project had give backed totaling more than 5% of their Medicare revenue, it is no surprise that CMS and Congress deems the demonstration of success and mandated a nationwide rollout by 2010. This program certainly has the attention of our members. To prepare for their audits, we see providers across the country, urgently focused on repairing the multiple weaknesses in their revenue cycle processes that lead to non-compliant billing. Additionally, their significant upside for hospitals that do this well and elevate operational performance and registration, physician documentation and claims coding. The rollout of the CMS program has created a driving need for hospitals to develop a broad compliance improvement plan quickly, and given our strong knowledge base, expertise and program depth in the revenue cycle space, we are well positioned to help them. To that end, I am pleased today to announce the launch of the Revenue Integrity Performance Program. This renewable membership program provides a comprehensive toolkit to help health system CFOs meet the challenges and opportunities presented by the RAC program by ensuring precision in coding and documentation, to enhance revenue capture accuracy and mitigate compliance related losses. Through best practice research, peer networking, and a robust web-based analytical tool, the Revenue Integrity Performance Program provides strategies for preventing negative RAC determinations, protocols for efficiently managing the RAC audit process, and filtering mechanisms for triaging potential RAC appeals. We've been able to get to market quickly and with the relatively low upfront investment by working with our revenue cycle technology partner on this launch. And as a result, we have already established a strong charter membership, including Hartford Health Care Corporation, Northern Michigan Hospital, Willis- Knighton Health System, Seton Family of Hospitals, and Nebraska Methodist Health System. The program is off to a very good start, and we are excited about its potential. I also wanted to provide an update on our work in the higher education sector. Now, three programs strong and serving provost, university business executives and student affairs officer. We continue to be pleased with our rollout of this business and are proud to be serving such premier organizations as Duke, Brown, Cornell, Georgetown, and the University of California System. Across, the programs, we've held five meeting series with an average GPA of 3.8, a strong showing for such [young] programs. As with our healthcare business and our education programs, we've also been nimble with our research topics, rapidly adjusting agenda to meet key member needs. To that end, recent research for our provost audience focuses on balancing university budgets and advancing academic and research priorities in a time of fiscal austerity while our upcoming student affairs research will surface best practices in capturing alternative revenue sources. Finally, our recent work for our university business executives is centered around finding and realizing cost reduction benefits, specifically in the areas of business services and energy cost. Across all three programs, members are very enthusiastic about the tangible impact our work provides and we are gratified with the traction we've got in this sector. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in greater detail. Michael Kirshbaum Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review on five categories. Income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2009. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on a March, 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. For the quarter just ended, revenue was $56.2 million, compared to $57. 9 million in the same period last year. EBITDA, excluding foreign exchange loss, net income and earnings per diluted share were $7.7 million, $3.9 million, and $0.25 respectively for the quarter ending March 31, 2009, compared to $12.4 million, $8.5 million and $0.47 respectively for the same quarter last year. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA can be found in our press release. Cost of services increased to $29.3 million or 52.1% of revenue, compared to $27.5 million or 47.5% revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in cost of services is primarily due to increased costs associated with new program launches, including Crimson, as well as increased investment associated with some of our analytic tools programs as discussed in our last call. Cost of services for the quarter ending March 31, 2009, decreased slightly sequentially from $29.7 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, due to the initial reductions from cost savings initiatives we put in place earlier in the year. Member relations and marketing spends was $13.3 million or 23.7% of revenue, compared to $12.2 million or 21.1% revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in expense is attributable mainly to an increase in our number of sales teams and other marking personnel. We currently have 111 sales teams in place. Member relations and marketing expense for the quarter ending March 31, 2009 decreased sequentially from $13.5 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2008, due to reductions in staff levels and other personnel expense. G&A expense in the quarter increased to $6 million or 10.6% of revenue, compared to $5.8 million or 10% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. Due to a decrease in equity forfeitures compared to the prior year. G&A expense for the quarter ending March 31, 2009 decreased sequentially by $800,000 from $13.5 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 due to personnel related savings. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter increased to $1.8 million or 3.2% of revenue, compared to $1 million or 1.7% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase is primarily from the amortization of capitalized costs related to development of analytical tools for some of our newer programs, as well as the amortization of intangible assets from the Crimson acquisition. Other expense net in the quarter was $300,000. This amount consists of interest income of $600,000, and an expense of $900,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. Moving on to our fiscal year income statement results. The 12 months ending March 31, 2009, revenue increased to $230.4 million, up from $219 million last year. EBITDA, excluding foreign exchange loss, net income and earnings per diluted share were $34.8 million, $21.5 million and $1.30 respectively for the 12 months ending March 31, 2009, compared to $45.5 million, $32.1 million, and $1.72 respectively for the same period last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables increased to $116.7 million as of March 31, 2009, up from $81.5 million as of March 31, 2008. DSOs, which were calculated using average receivables were 196 days in the quarters ended March 31, 2008, up from 176 days last quarter, and 137 days in March, 2008. Increase in DSOs is due to the continued increase in mix towards a higher price point programs, which include more progress billings. Excluding the effects of these progress payments, DSOs on billed AR remained constant with our expectation, and we're 56 days as of March 31, 2009, similar to the same metric of March, 2008 of 55 days. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we've build up for 12 months, increased to 18.3% to $170.5 million as of March 31, 2009, up from $144.1 million as of March 31, 2008. Increase in deferred revenues is due mainly to higher proportion of multi-year contracts. Excluding prepaid contract and long-term deferred, the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2009 was $148.3 million, up 12.6% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow. During the three months ended December 31, 2009, we generated $9.6 million of cash from operating activities, compared to $21.7 million in the same quarter last year. In the 12 months ending December 31, 2009, cash flow generated from operations was $39.7 million, or 1.9 times net income, compared to $60.3 million, also 1.9 times net income in the same period last year. Capital expenditures for the three months ending December 31, 2009, were approximately $1.7 million, of which $1.2 million was related to capitalized development and hardware associated with analytic tools included in some of our newer programs, compared to $3.2 million in total capital expenditures for three months ended December 31, 2008. This decrease is due to reduced levels of capital expenditures associated with our analytic tools programs when compared to the same period of the prior year. In the three months ending March 31, 2009, we repurchased $5 million of stock or approximately 273,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $304 million or approximately 7.2 million shares. As of March 31, 2009, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $46 million. As of March 31, 2009, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances were approximately $93.8 million. Now to contract value. Our contract value was $230.8 million as of March 31, 2009, and March 31, 2008, compared to $230.6 million and $230.9 million in September and December of 2008 respectively. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time, without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with than 12 months in duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. With respect to the remainder of calendar year 2009, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call, and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change overtime. For the remainder of calendar year 2009, we are reiterating our guidance for revenue, earnings per diluted share and EBITDA. As previously announced, calendar 2009 revenue is expected to be within a few percentage points of calendar 2008 revenue, and we expect it to be evenly distributed to slightly back- weighted on the year. We expect EBITDA in a range of approximately $27 million to $33 million, and earnings per diluted share of approximately $0.90 to $1.20. EBITDA and earnings per diluted share are expected to be fairly evenly distributed across the year. This concludes the financial summary. I will now turn things back over to Robert. Robert Musslewhite Thanks, Michael. As will you recall, on our last call we highlighted three key areas of investment this year that will position us for future growth and scale. New program development, enhancing our sales and marketing organization, and improving our core data management and technology platform for our analytical tools program. I wanted to give you a brief update on each of these areas in turn. First, let me turn to new program development, which has two main components. Scaling last year's launches, and launching new financially focused programs this year. Last year's launches continue to perform well and expand their footprints in the market. As an example, while it is still early, the traction that the Physician Management Performance Program has gotten in the marketplace indicates that Crimson was a strong choice to add to our portfolio. This has been one of our fastest launches in our history and we are pleased that the average implementation time remains under three months, despite the large influx of business. In addition, member feedback has been extraordinary, with the programs physician executive intensive scoring a 3.8 GPA, and 92% of members reporting in QA call, that they would recommend the program to their peers. Given the critical role that physicians play in hospital's cost containment efforts, the membership has been a good match for today's environment of cost austerity, and we project the program to continue to scale well into the future. This year, we have continued to invest in new launches, specifically in products heavily tailored to delivering tangible margin impact in this climate. The market interest, we are already seeing in the Revenue Integrity Performance Program indicates that even in these times, there's still an acute need for mission-critical new programs that provide large rapid returns, around the key pinpoints of the membership and we're feeling good about the early returns on this area of investment. Second, our work continues on enhancing our sales and marketing organization and we are making strides in building the infrastructure that we believe will service well going forward. While in general, given that the March quarter is usually a small sales quarter for us, we would not expect to see results earlier in the year, preliminary indicators such as inbound sales leads are trending positively, and we remain committed to improving the flow of information and intelligence about members and prospective members across the organization. We continue to feel confident that these investments will improve our future sales effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, we are progressing in our analytical tools, platform investments. These programs continue to be strong additions to our portfolio, as they address critical member needs for actionable and reliable data that enabled performance improvement in multiple areas. We remained excited about these programs, given the large new market they tap, their stickiness and renewability, their potential to drive dramatic impact for our members and the industry as a whole and their potential to deliver strong contribution as the membership moves into renewal years. Our work here has centered in four main areas. First, fortifying program operations. As we mentioned, we're in the process of upgrading our current data extraction and loading process through the development of more standardized tools for implementation, particularly in the clinical terrain where accessing the data is more complex. The good news is that we are proven processors for doing this that we use successfully today in our more recent launches, such as the Emergency Department Performance Program and the Physician Management Performance Program that serve as a roadmap for the upgrades we are making in other products. Second, we are taking advantage of interesting high margin extensions around current tools, which we can bring to market with development and marketing costs that are significantly lower than those for selling a brand new product into a new constituency. Third, we are employing strategies to ensure that all of our analytical tools in all programs are leveraged in key daily workflows at our member institutions. By syndicating best practices and tool usage across the membership through such channels as push emails, teleconferences, and annual member summits, we are able to enhance both the value that the individual members received from the pogroms and the stickiness of the tools. Finally, we are continuing to see significant opportunity in new terrains and areas of member need. Our recent launch experience shows that members continue to be willing to purchase products when there's a critical member issue and we can offer a solution that provides clear, measurable value. Therefore, our ongoing firm-wide new program development efforts, include research into new opportunities to serve our members with highly impactful analytical tools. Let me close with a word about talent. In an environment, where we took costs out of our base operations and have higher expectations than ever for the impact that we need to provide our members, I am extremely proud of our outstanding staff, now more than 1,000 strong. Everyone throughout the organization has met these challenging times with commitment, engagement and a burning drive to execute the highest standards. Their hard work, expertise and passion is the engine that powers the impact that we are having across the industry and positions us well for future success. While the environment remains challenging, we continue to be very focused on building a scaleable high- growth company, which provides superior member value and service. We see incredible long-term growth potential in the industries we serve and continue to focus intently on capturing this potential. With our strong cash flow characteristics, renewable revenue base, and over $90 million in cash on the balance sheet, combined with our extraordinary talent and strong member relationships, we continue to be well positioned for success over the longer term. That completes the formal part of the call. And now we'll be happy to take your questions."

I'm Robert Musslewhite, Chief Executive Officer of the Advisory Board Company, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will open with a summary of our performance for the quarter and for our fiscal year, which ended March 31, 2010, along with the discussion of our strategy within the context of the broader market environment. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our key priorities for the remainder of the calendar year. As always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the call. Let me start with our financial results. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, increased 13% to $63.4 million from $56.2 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Net income was $5.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share compared to $3.9 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Included in the net income for the quarter are pretax costs of $1.1 million relating to the acquisition of Concuity. Excluding the effects, net of tax, of these charges, adjusted net income for the quarter was $5.8 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.37, representing growth of 48% for each metric over the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased 35% to $10.6 million for the quarter compared to $7.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2009. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010, revenue increased 4% to $239.3 million from $230.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2009. Net income was $11.4 million or $0.73 per diluted share compared to net income of $21.5 million or $1.30 per diluted share for the prior fiscal year. Adjusted net income for the fiscal year, which excludes certain non-cash items and Concuity deal fees was $18.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.17. Adjusted EBITDA was $33.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2010, compared to $35.6 million for the same period a year ago. Contract value grew 13% to $261.1 million as of March 31, 2010, up from $238.8 million as of March 31, 2009. With a membership base of 2,985 institutions as of the close of the fiscal year, our average contract value per member increased to $87,474. We are pleased with our performance for the quarter and the fiscal year and are happy to be off to a good start against our calendar 2010 objectives. We have continued to see momentum that began over the latter half of 2009, building in the business in 2010 as evidenced by our revenue and EBITDA growth for the quarter, as well as by our contract value growth over last year at this time. Our strategy in 2009, which included key investments in the scalability of our tools programs, sales and marketing innovation and new product development efforts, served us well in setting up strong business performance in 2010. And we continued the same dual-track approach into this year, a sustained focus on cost discipline along with the continued targeted investment in the business for future growth. We are also pleased to have achieved an overall renewal rate for the year of 89%, which comes in at the high end of our historical range. As we have discussed in the past, our renewal rate is one of our most important metrics as it gauges product quality and member satisfaction and is a critical factor in establishing our platform for future growth. This year's strong renewal performance is particularly gratifying, given what a challenging year 2009 was for our members. That members prioritized our programs in times when every budget dollar is heavily scrutinized, demonstrates not only that our programs are addressing members' most important strategic and operational issues, but also that our programs have become effectively hardwired into members' decision making and that members derive concrete economic returns from their participation in the Advisory Board. In all, it has been a great start to the year. In terms of the broader market environment, the biggest events to take place since our last teleconference was clearly the passage in late March of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the much debated Obama health care bill. Coming in at 2,409 pages, it is an understatement to describe this legislation is complex, and our teams have done a fantastic job of distilling it into the key implications for our members and developing a robust set of resources to help them through this time of tremendous change. These include, among others, a six-part teleconference series on implications of reform that was attended by more than 1,400 member organization executive teams and scored an average GPA of 3.7, a new suite of online tools to allow members to benchmark both reforms likely impact on their health systems and their institution's readiness for delivery system transformation, and playbooks for such critical reform imperatives as physician alignment, clinical innovation and IT infrastructure. Throughout our work over the last year on this important topic, our key messages to our member CEOs and their teams have remained consistent. It has long been our strong belief that a fundamental transformation of care delivery will be the hallmark of success for our members into the future. Now that the legislation has passed, this imperative is heightened. It is no small task, and it is clear that it is one where members need our best practice support, tools and services more than ever. First, as government coverage expands and as baby boomers surge into the Medicare program, hospitals need to develop new care models that allow them to make a margin caring for seniors, particularly since changing patient demographics will mean that the traditional approach of cross-subsidizing below-cost government reimbursement with lucrative commercial payments will become increasingly difficult. Forward-looking health systems are investing in chronic disease management capabilities, care coordination and information-powered health care delivery to help face this challenge. These are all complex undertakings where members seek our assistance. Second, the bill's longer-term incentives for delivery system reform underscore how critical value-based physician alignment will be to a hospital's future fortunes. While strong hospital physician alignment has always been a cornerstone of success, the necessary degree of future collaboration, partnership and risk sharing [indiscernible] (31:05) what has come before. Hospitals and physicians will have to recognize, embrace and leverage their growing interdependence to create organizational structures and incentive models that are strategically aligned and mutually rewarding. Third, while hospitals can expect to see a meaningful decrease in uncompensated care due to the coverage expansion enacted through the bill, revenue cycle efficiency will continue to be of utmost importance. Today, the fastest growing category of hospital bad debt write-offs stems from non-payment of patient obligations from insured patients. Our regulations around benefit design and subsidies for out- of-pocket costs may soften the edges of the provider's growing insured patient bad debt problem. These solutions will not completely mitigate the need for ongoing revenue cycle investment. Cost shifting the health plan enrollees will closely follow today's trends, such that minimizing bad debt and optimizing the revenue cycle will remain a top priority for most organizations. And finally, because measures throughout the bill will force hospitals to do more with less, a heightened focus on operational efficiency across the organization will be critical. Measures like cuts in reimbursements, new methods for market basket updates and new payment incentives aimed at bending the cost curve will require fundamental changes in the way our members work with physicians and care for patients, and they need our help to make these changes successfully. Overall, while there is no guarantee that the changes ushered in by this new area of reform will be good for every hospital and health system, it is our belief that every organization can positively respond to the opportunities to increase their relevance in the market and improve the value of the care they deliver. The key to success for most operators will be evolving the delivery model to provide highly reliable, efficient care in a network of coordinated providers. Of course, this is a big job, and there's always risk in the transition from a familiar and entrenched model to a novel one. But it is exactly in times like this, times of change in complexity, that the power of our model is most apparent, as members consistently turn to us as their trusted partner to guide them through the change. It is our responsibility to remain the leader in serving them with cutting-edge insights, world-class analytic and workflow tools and powerful solutions, such that we position them for success as the health care landscape evolves. To that end, we remain focused on executing at a high standard, and I'm excited about the inroads we are making in serving our members deeply and comprehensively around their key areas of challenge. In addition to the many new resources we are developing to track and respond the reform, our existing portfolio also provides key assets as we seek to provide our members the critical support that they need at this time. Let me give you just three examples. First, the perennial issue of working with physicians taking on a new urgency for our hospital members, and their agendas are increasingly dominated by questions about how to most effectively collaborate, manage and work with both independent and affiliated physicians. Our resources that serve our members on these issues are unparalleled. Because physician alignment has long been important to our members, our research engine has been focused on it for years, and we have consistently been the leading and most trusted source of best practice research and insights to members on this topic. Over the last several years, we have completed five major research initiatives focused on hospital physician issues, profiling scores of best practices in this area and developing a deep bench of more than 40 experts on the topic. Thousands of executives around member hospitals and health systems have leveraged this work in building their physician strategies, and they consistently report that our guidance here is timely, insightful and impactful. Given the importance of physician alignment, the addition in 2008 of the Crimson Physician Performance Management Program to our portfolio was a significant development, bringing us a powerful set of tools to analyze physician performance on clinical quality and cost measures. Our experience in leveraging this product within our membership has been excellent. Over the nearly two years since we brought Crimson to market, it has become the leading physician performance platform in the industry with strong growth in the cohort. Our experienced scale in Crimson through our Physician Management Performance Program shows how combining a strong technology with our deep knowledge base of relevant best practices results in a whole that is much greater than the sum of its parts. The power of our work with Crimson is also evident in the tremendous impact that the members of our Physician Management Performance Program are achieving. For example, one member has used the Crimson tool and our best practices to tackle Medicare length of stay, a metric that will be increasingly important under health care reform. Leveraging the Crimson technology, the hospital was able to identify 13 internists with above average length of stay for their Medicare populations. Placing Advisory Board best prices to drive an improvement initiative with that group, the hospital was able to achieve a reduction of 500 Medicare patient days for annualized savings of nearly $2.5 million, while maintaining a uniform standard of quality across the internist group. Through our Crimson Physician Management Performance Program and the scale that we have achieved, we are now replicating these types of results nationwide and are, as a result, driving tremendous impact across the industry. The second example of leveraging our portfolio to serve members with their most critical issues is in the revenue cycle, where health reform and continued financial pressure in the market spur members to seek our help. Hospitals and health systems keenly feel the imperative to accelerate cash collection, minimize denials and maximize collections. Given each hospital's multiple contracts with a variety of payors representing countless contract terms, just tracking all the moving parts, much less optimizing performance against them, is daunting indeed. Compounding the challenge, both legislation and market- wide trends toward value-based care bring prospects of new, more complex payment mechanisms, including those that will bundle hospital and physician payments, which will add to health system's already challenging burden of negotiating, tracking and complying with their myriad contracts. This changing landscape is exactly the type of area where our members acutely need our help. Hereto, our work is delivering measurable results to our members. For example, one member used the tools and best practices in their Revenue Integrity Performance Program membership to identify 15 risk target areas meeting high-dollar, high-risk thresholds. Through training on our best practices in coding and documentation and appropriately rebilling for procedures, the hospital yielded more than $200,000 of additional revenue. A different member, who works with us to implement a best-in-class registration process through the Patient Registration Performance Program, saw patient access-related denials decrease 30% for an impact totaling more than $2 million. Stories like these abound across our revenue cycle franchise, and we are incredibly excited at our ability to deliver such strong results in this critical area of member concern. Given our strong revenue cycle performance to date, I'm pleased that our transaction to purchase Concuity closed on April 1, which enables us to announce today the launch of our newest membership program in this vertical, the Payer Integrity Performance Program. In an area when small differences in yield per payer can quickly swing an institution from profitability to a negative margin, it is particularly troublesome that most hospitals continue to find gaps as large as 11% between expected and actual payment across all payers. This disturbing trend of payer non-compliance produced a staggering cumulative effect ranging from $1 million to $3 million annually for a 350-bed hospital. Through best practice research, peer networking and access to Concuity's robust, web-based, ClearContracts analytical tool, the renewable Payer Integrity Performance Program helps members hardwire our best practice workflow intervention, advanced payment calculations and sophisticated payer contract modeling to halt revenue leakage and ensure proper payment. Due to the Concuity tool's ability to process physician revenue cycle data and contracts, the Payer Integrity Performance Program is uniquely positioned to integrate the facility and professional revenue cycle, which will become increasingly important as the market moves toward bundled payments. We are very excited about the potential of this newest launch and the depth that it adds to our successful portfolio of revenue cycle products and services. Both of those we deliver directly and those delivered through our long-standing relationship with MedeAnalytics and our new relationship with Recondo. Finally, as health reform and market forces drive the need for innovative workflow processes and clinical practice, the foundation of sound IT choices and strong implementation execution will increasingly be critical to future hospital and health system success. Hereto, we are able to serve members broadly and deeply. The new collaboration with HIMSS Analytics that we announced in March will allow us to provide a new level of business-oriented information technology research to our member health care executives and IT leaders. Through this joint work, we will enable hospital and health systems to improve technology adoption by the physician and other important stakeholders, leverage the technology to impact care delivery and drive continued value from IT investments. Taking a step back, I would say that overall, the market changes across the last quarter have created a very exciting environment, and there is tremendous energy across all areas of the firm. It is incredibly motivating for our teams to see firsthand the impact they are having on our members' performance and broader strategy. And the backdrop of the National Health Reform Debate only throws that realization into higher relief. From physician alignment, revenue cycle and information technology to a strategic supply chain management, operational efficiency across the enterprise and optimizing labor productivity, our members are consistently looking to us for help with their most critical and urgent concerns. And it is an honor to be in the position to serve as their trusted guide across this broad and important set of issues. With that, let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around five categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2010. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 12.8% to $63.4 million, up from $56.2 million in the same period last year due to strong renewal performance and pulling forward new sales. Adjusted EBITDA grew 34.7% to $10.6 million, up from $7.9 million last year. Adjusted net income grew 48.3% to $5.8 million, up from $3.9 million last year. And non- GAAP EPS grew 48% to $0.37, up from $0.25 last year. The adjusted non-GAAP numbers for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, exclude costs of approximately $1.1 million pretax related to our acquisition of Concuity on 4/1 that were incurred during the quarter. Including these acquisition-related costs, GAAP net income and income per diluted share were $5.1 million and $0.32, respectively. Reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. Cost of services increased 6.7% to $31.2 million or 49.3% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2010, compared to $29.3 million or 52.1% of revenue in the same quarter of the previous year. Cost of services increased primarily due to increased cost associated with new programs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of services decreased through the scalability of incremental revenue inherent in our model. Member relations and marketing expense was $14.4 million or 22.8% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2010, compared to $13.3 million or 23.7% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. We currently have 125 sales teams in place, an increase from the 111 sales teams we had in place at the quarter ended March 31, 2009. G&A expense increased to $8.9 million or 14% of revenue in the quarter ending March 31, 2010 compared to $6 million or 10.6% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year due primarily to $1.1 million of acquisition costs related to Concuity as well as investments in new product development and IT. Excluding the acquisition cost, G&A was 12.2% of revenue for the quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $1.4 million or 2.2% of revenue compared to $1.8 million or 3.2% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. Other income net in the quarter was $191,000 compared to a loss of $289,000 in the same period the prior year. This quarter's other income consists of interest income of $484,000 and a loss of $294,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members. During the quarter ended March 31, 2009, we had interest income of $600,000 and a loss of $900,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to our fiscal year income statement results. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2010, revenue increased 3.9% to $239.3 million, up from $230.4 million last year. Excluding the acquisition-related cost incurred this quarter and the non-cash charges incurred during September 2009, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $33.2 million, $18.3 million and $1.17, respectively, for fiscal year 2010 compared to $35.6 million, $21.5 million and $1.30, respectively, for the previous fiscal year. GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, were $11.4 million and $0.73, respectively. Turning to the balance sheet. Memberships fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased 23% to $143.5 million as of March 31, 2010 compared to $116.7 million as of March 31, 2009. DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables were 205 days in the quarter ending March 31, 2010, up from 195 days in the quarter ending March 31, 2009. The year-over-year increase in DSOs is due to continued increasing mix towards the higher placement programs, which include more product selling as well as more multi-year contracts. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs on bill day were 53 days as of March 31, 2010, down from 57 days as of March 31, 2009 due to improved collections. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we billed after 12 months, increased to $208.4 million as of March 31, 2010, up 22.2% from $170.5 million as of March 31, 2009. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2010 was $180 million, up 21.4% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ended March 31, 2010, our cash generated from operating activities was $19.2 million compared to $9.6 million in the same quarter last year. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010, cash flow generated from operations was $46.7 million compared to $39.7 million in the same period last year. Cash flow from operations for the 12 months ending March 31, 2006, (sic) [2010] was 2.6x adjusted net income compared to 1.9x for the same period the prior year. For fiscal 2011, we expect cash flow from operations to be within our historical range of 1.5x to 2x net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending March 31, 2010 were approximately $1.1 million compared to $1.7 million in capital expenditures for the three months ending March 31, 2009. This decrease is due to reduced level of capitalized expenditures associated with our analytic tools program this year when compared to the same period the prior year. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures, were $18.1 million in the quarter ending March 31, 2010, up from $7.9 million the same quarter last year. For the fiscal year, free cash flow was $44.1 million or $2.85 per share compared to $24.7 million or $1.50 per share last year. For the three months ending March 31, 2010, we repurchased $1 million of stock for approximately 31,000 shares. This means our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 is $308 million or approximately 7.3 million shares. As of March 31, 2010, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $42 million. As of March 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $112.9 million or just over $7 per share. At the contract value, contract value increased 13.1% to $261.1 million as of March 31, 2010, up from $230.8 million as of March 31, 2009. We define contract value to be aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect to any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. Since the Concuity acquisition was effective as of 4/1/2010, no Concuity contracts were included on contract values of 3/31/2010. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar 2010, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor Provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2010, we are raising our revenue gross guidance to a range of approximately 13% to 15% over calendar year 2009. We're also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of approximately $35.5 million to $40.5 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to a range of approximately $1.11 to $1.27 for the year. For the remainder of calendar 2010, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 35.5% to 36.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn it back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about our priorities for the rest of the year, and then we will take any questions you have. Coming out of the gate in 2010 with a strong first quarter, we are gratified that our hard work has put us back on a solid growth trajectory. At the same time, our members still face quite a bit of uncertainty and change, and we know that a sustained commitment to excellence and outstanding execution across our business is what we need to achieve our objectives. In that context, I have laid out for our team four key priorities for the remainder of the year. First, we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions into the broader portfolio in order to ensure that we maximize the benefit, both to the membership and to the business of the new products and services. To that end, we are investing top management talent in overseeing our new acquisitions and relationships, Southwind, Concuity and HIMSS Analytics. These business leaders are collaborating with each other and also applying the lessons learned from our successful Crimson integration as the playbook for rolling out these newer initiatives. Early progress has been good, and we are optimistic that with focus and hard work, each of these initiatives will yield important benefits for one of the firm's key strategic verticals. Second, we continue to focus on and invest in new product development efforts. We find ourselves in a unique moment in time where broad industry disruption is creating a wide variety of needs for support within our membership base. Through our deep relationships with our members, we are systematically exploring those needs, developing ideas for new programs to meet them and testing those ideas through our approved and new product development methodology. Our pipeline today of over 25 new program concepts is more robust than ever, and we will continue to explore the market for interesting partnership or acquisition opportunities that meet our rigorous criteria and fit our growth strategy. Third, we will continue to drive flawless execution across all areas of the business particularly in sales, marketing and account management. The recent completion of our annual division goal-setting exercise has honed each department's focus, providing an outstanding communication vehicle for alignment of the broader staff and reiterated our commitment to excellence at all levels of the firm. The energy behind our commercial operations continues to be outstanding and motivating to all functions across the business. Now we've expanded our sales teams to 125 to capitalize on this excitement. We continue to build creative initiatives to drive warm leads, improve relationship building, leverage intelligence gathering on specific areas of member need, enhance collateral and positioning and develop innovative promotion strategies. With solid results from our work here to date, we are confident that these strategies will continue to bear fruit across the course of the year. Finally, as always, we continue to invest in world class talent in all levels of the organization. The greatest strength of the Advisory Board is our incredibly talented and committed employee base. And as such, we place a high priority on the attraction, development, engagement and retention of outstanding people. The recent momentum of the business is very motivating to our team as they see clearly the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead, both for them as individuals and for us collectively as a firm. With these priorities solidly in place, I'm confident that we will continue our early momentum this year and position ourselves for profitable growth into the future. The team and I are excited by our progress and honored by the trust of our nearly 3,000 members who daily look to us for help on their most critical issues. Our gathering depth of relationships with them provides an outstanding platform for continuing to elevate our impact and reach in the industries we serve. Thanks for joining tonight's call, and why don't we take the time now to answer your questions."
185,GV_145042_2011Q4,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Advisory Board Company’s fourth quarter earnings conference call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Please proceed. Robert Musslewhite Thank you, good evening. I am Robert Musslewhite, Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company, and I’m joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a three-part agenda for this evening’s call. First, I will open with a summary of our performance for the quarter and for our fiscal year which ended March 31, 2011, covering our financial results and the drivers of our business performance. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our key priorities for the remainder for the calendar year. As always, we will be happy to take questions at the end of the call. Let me start with an overview of our financial results. Revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 increased nearly 22% to $77.2 million from $63.4 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $0.42 per diluted share and $12 million respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011 revenue increased 21% to $290.2 million from $239.3 million for the year-ended March 31, 2010. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $1.71 per diluted share and $48 million respectively, compared with the $1.66 per diluted share and $43.8 million for the year-ended March 31, 2010. We closed the quarter and the fiscal year with strong performance and are happy to be off to a good start against our calendar 2011 objectives. The continued change in complexity in the markets we serve is driving a sustained urgent need for our research and software products and our consulting services, as evidenced by both our 22% revenue growth for the quarter and also bear a contract value which increased almost 19% over last year to $310.1 million as of March 31, 2011. In addition, our membership base grew nearly 9% to 3,243 institutions as of the close of the fiscal year and our average contract value per member increased to $95,606, up from $87,474 last year. When gauging the health of the business, one of the most important fiscal year in metrics is our renewal rates, as it reflects both product quality and member satisfaction and is a critical factor of establishing our platform for future growth. This year we achieved an outstanding 91% overall renewal rate which comes in at the high end of our historical range and the highest levels since 2005. Not surprisingly our other measures of product quality and member feedback have also been very strong. Across our membership programs, our leading series are achieving blockbuster scores with our flagship healthcare strategy program, our program for nursing executives, our program for chief medical officers and our cardiology and oncology programs all achieving the highest GPAs on record. Our software programs are seeing similarly strong QA results. And across all programs we are getting great feedback from members about the value we are providing at a time when they most need our help. These results are mirrored by the performance of our higher education programs where members are also sharing stories of the high value we provide in a complex and challenging market. One of the reasons we were able to meet the wide array of member needs at this time of complexity and change is the robust portfolio of products and services we have invested in building over the last several years. In today’s dynamic market, members are asking not only that we drive inside around new topics such as value based purchasing in meaningful years, but also that we work with them in deeper more comprehensive ways offering software and services to partner with them in the transformation of the market demands. And because we have expanded the products and services we offer, we are well positioned to meet these requests and deliver members value where they most need it. In fact, we have documented through individual case studies signed off by our members, cumulative member value totaling over $1.5 billion over the last four years. Our new capabilities have been key to driving strong top line growth. Today our software memberships comprised more than 50% of our total contract value with over 1,000 organizations participating representing 1,500 memberships. It is exciting to cross these important milestones and see how our growth strategy continues to bear fruit. With the many opportunities before us, to deepen our work with our members, we believe that moving fast to do so in today’s unique market will provide us important advantages and scale going forward. Given that, it is important that we continue to selectively build new capabilities into existing programs as well as launch new programs in areas where members need our help most. Last year at this time, we discussed the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the much debated Obama Healthcare Bill. While the law was the combination of many months of congressional debate and much corresponding analysis on our part. It was of course actually only the beginning of the road for our members. The law set forth the broad brush strokes of the new healthcare landscape, but the devil is always in the details and as we push to the next level of detail now, the hard work for our members has begun in earnest. For example, one challenge for our members is digesting the many new rules and regulations being issued. From the HHS final rule for how hospitals could demonstrate meaningful use of Electronic Health Records qualified for Federal Incentive Payments to the proposed regulations for the Medicare Shared Savings Program to last week’s final rule for Medicare’s Value-Based Purchasing Program. There has been a steady stream of dense federal rules and regulations to synthesize, literally thousands of pages to read and understand. In each case, our team is not only been passed out of the gate with the summary of the new rules, but also has quickly provided value added analysis of their implications for our members. Members were particularly grateful for our recent work on the Medicare Shared Savings Program. On March 31, the proposed rule was released. And by the next day our research team had not only digested the nearly 500 page rule, but also published a bulletin to the membership highlighting key points of the rule and answering members five most frequently asked questions about it. This piece sets the stage for a series of teleconferences we did over the next several weeks delving deeper into the material and providing a comprehensive analysis of the rules implications. The feedback from our members was tremendous with more than 1,200 participants attending, GPAs reaching 3.8 and very strong member response. As one member wrote in their evaluation of the first teleconference, this was outstanding content with a great presenter. It is remarkable how much deep analysis you put together this fast. On a later call, a member commented, I’ve heard three presentations on the Medicare Shared Savings Program today. Your presentation was by far the best, well organized, good flow and most applicable to our decision making and strategy development process. As you can see, members were very excited about our frameworks to understand the regulations and broader landscape, analysis of the new imperatives for competing in today’s market and critical tools for setting the right strategy for their institutions. In addition, now more than ever, members look to us for software and services to build the critical capabilities needed to execute that strategy. In that context, I am pleased to announce today the launch of two new programs in key areas of member needs. The first, Crimson Care Registry, built on our successful Crimson platform to provide new point-of-care patient registry tools based on proven clinical care guidelines from a variety of sources. By incorporating the capabilities of CLO, the company we acquired earlier this year, we are responding to a need articulated by our Crimson user base and the market more broadly, complementing Crimson analytics with the dynamic tool that fits into existing workflows and drives the delivery of evidence based care to each patients regardless of diagnosis or category of health problems. Crimson Care Registry helps physicians improve patient care by providing actionable and customizable prompts during care delivery, capturing clinical information and aligning physician quality across the ambulatory setting. Let me further explain by providing an example. If a hospital has high 30 day readmission rates, Crimson analytics allow the physicians and hospital executives to see what the driver might be. Let’s say for example that the Crimson analysis reveals that the driver is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD cases. In such an instance the complementary use of Crimson Care Registry would allow physicians to identify the point-of-care any individual COPD patients who have not received the care or interventions recommended by evidenced based guidelines. Physicians can then take action real time to deliver the care or intervention, thereby improving care which will in turn improve the overall 30 day readmission rate metric. By flagging these patients for doctors within their regular workflow, the technology under guarding Crimson Care Registry has proven to increase adherence to evidence based guidelines, thereby improving quality outcomes. Further, in context to the movement towards pay for performance structures, once were measures on quality metrics had begun to impact payment, this type of performance improvement can also mean real dollars for physicians and hospitals. We anticipate that Crimson Care Registry will be an essential tool for our members moving towards value based payment structures and are confident that the addition of the product to the Crimson portfolio will provide tremendous value to all members of the program. The second new product launch that I am pleased to announce today expands our footprint in the revenue cycle and addresses the patient pre- certification process, the critical pain point for our members. A bit of background here might be helpful. Securing pre-certification including authorization and medical necessities for patient treatments and procedures requires a huge outlay of human resources for most hospitals and health systems. The approved certification errors remain a significant costs of payment denials. Our research shows that 54% of payer denied claims are attributed to improper pre-certification. Errors that result in a 3% to 5% loss of net revenue for most hospitals. For facilities that have begun to integrate physician clinics as part of their accountable care journey, the burden is even greater and the resulting denial is even costlier. Across the country, healthcare CFOs  are turning their attention to the issue in earnest. Against that backdrop, I am pleased to announce today the launch of the Clinical Denials Prevention Program which automates the process of securing the authorizations and submitting new payers, thereby preventing denials related to improper patient pre- certifications. Through software that leverages both hospital and payer datasets as well as the proprietary robust comprehensive authorization rules mentioned, the Clinical Denials Prevention Program aids hospitals with the creation of an accurate and efficient patient pre-certification process. Not only is this critical to near-term revenue cycle performance but also it is a key tool to future performance, as hospitals face the prospect of dramatic increases in the number of patients requiring pre-certification for treatments, given market trends seeking the rationalized care. The Clinical Denials Prevention Program built on the existing front-end revenue cycle capabilities of our Payment Navigation Performance Program and is an exciting addition to our broader revenue cycle portfolio. Looking at both of the new programs we have just launched, it is opportunities like these that we continue to be excited about. Once we are able to develop this distinctive new capability in response to member requests for a deeper level of partnership to solve their most important strategic and operational issues. Given the many such opportunities today’s landscape provides us, I had never felt better about the pipeline of potential new program rollouts and our prospects for expanding both our impact for and relationships with our members. With that let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail. Michael Kirshbaum Thanks, Robert. I’ve organized today’s financial review around five categories, income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2011. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we are on a March 31 fiscal year-end, which means we just finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 21.8% $77.2 million up from $63.4 million in the same period of prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $12 million, $7.4 million, $0.44 respectively for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 compared to $12.9 million, $7.6 million and $0.48 respectively for the same quarter last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarter ending March 31, 2011 exclude acquisition related costs and amortization as well as share based compensation expense. Reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non- GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including the acquisition related costs of share based compensation expense, GAAP net income and income per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 was $5.1 million and $0.30 respectively. Cost of services increased to $41.3 million or 53.5% of revenue in the quarter ending March 31, 2011 compared to $31.2 million or 49.3% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. Cost of services increased primarily due to increased costs associated with our new programs including cost associated with our acquisitions in Concuity and CLO as well as continued expansion of our Crimson platform. Also included in cost of services for the three months ended March 31, 2011 was $1 million of amortization expense with acquisitions compared to $600,000 for the same period of prior year. Member relations and marketing expense was $16.7 million or 21.6% of revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 compared to $14.4 million or 22.8% of revenue in the same quarter of prior year. Currently we have 145 sales teams in place, an increase from 125 sales teams in place in the quarter ended March 31, 2010. G&A expense increased to $10.6 million or 13.7% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2010, $38.9 million or 14% or revenue in the same quarter of prior year due primarily to increase in talent recruitment and new product development expenses as well as increased investment in our information system infrastructure and human resources to support our growing employee base. Also included in G&A expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 cost of $400,000 related to acquisition of CLO. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $1.7 million or 2.2% of revenue compared to $1.4 million or 2.2% of revenue for the same quarter of the prior year. Other income net in the quarter was $588,000 compared to $191,000 in the same quarter to the prior year. This quarters other income consist of interest income of $536,000 and a gain of $52,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates effecting our receivables from international members. During the quarter ended March 31, 2010 we had interest income of $484,000 and a loss of $294,000 from changes of foreign currency exchange rates. Moving onto our fiscal year income statement results. For the 12 months ending March 31, 2011 revenue increased 21.3% to $290.2 million, up from $239.3 million last year. GAAP net income, and earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 were $18.5 million and $1.13 respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $48 million, $28.4 million and a $1.73 respectively of fiscal year 2011 compared to $43.8 million, $26.1 million and $1.66 respectively in previous fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable which excludes long term receivables increased to $179.2 million as of March 31, 2011 compared to $143.5 million as of March 31, 2010. Gross DSOs which we calculate using average receivables were 218 in the quarter ended March 31, 2011 up from 205 days as of March 31, 2010. The year-over-year increase in DSOs is due to continued increase in mix with our higher placement programs which includes more product billings as well as more multiyear contracts. Excluding the effect of progress payments, DSOs on bill day are 50 days as of March 31, 2011, down from 53 days as of March 31, 2011 due to improved collections. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we billed up to 12 months increased to $266 million as of March 31, 2011 up from 27.6% from $208.4 million as of March 31, 2010. Excluding long-term preferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2011 was $290.7 million, up 22% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the three months ended March 31, 2011, our cash generated from operating activities is $15.8 million compared to $19.2 million in the same quarter last year. For fiscal year ending March 31, 2011 cash flow generated from operations was $50.5 million, up from $46.7 million in the prior fiscal year. For fiscal year ‘011 cash flow from operations is 2.7 times GAAP net income and 1.8 times adjusted net income. Capital expenditures for the three months ending March 31, 2011 were approximately $3.5 million compared to $1.1 million for the three months ending March 31, 2010. This increase is due to the increased levels of capital expenditures associated with our analytic tools program this year when compared to the same period of the prior year. For the three months ending March 31, 2011, we repurchased $1.8 million of stock or approximately 36,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $316 million or approximately 7.5 million shares. As of March 31, 2011, the remaining authorized repurchase amount was $34 million. As of March 31, 2011, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $115.6 million representing about $6.95 per diluted share. As to contract value, contract value increased 18.7% to $310.1 million as of March 31, 2011 up from $251.1 million as of March 31, 2010. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with more than 12 months duration, we only include 12 months of contract value. With respect to the outlook for remainder of calendar year 2011, the following comments were intended to fall under the safe harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar year 2011 we expect revenues to be in the range of approximately $318 million to $326 million, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of approximately $56 million to $60 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of approximately $1.85 to $2.00. Also for calendar year 2011, we expect share based compensation expense to be approximately $10 million and the amortization from acquisition related intangible assets to be approximately $4.5 million. We expect earnings for calendar year 2011 to be back weighted on the year. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 36.5% to 37.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I will now turn things back over to Robert. Robert Musslewhite Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about our priorities for the rest of the year and then we will take any questions you have. As we continue on our accelerated growth trajectory and seek to capitalize from the opportunities before us, it is essential that we perceive with the sustained focus in these four key areas. First, our priorities to ensure continued outstanding value delivery to members. This has been a guiding principal since the founding of the firm and has never been more critical than today, when our members need our help more than ever, by focusing first and foremost on solving members problems and thereby delivering strong value to them, we ensure that we remain are chosen and trusted partner in these complex times. Employees at all levels of the firm work each day to deliver innovative research and tools, excellent service, reliable and valuable software and real impact to members of every program. Through this faithful work and the outstanding returns our members see from it, we’ve build member loyalty deep in our relationships and strengthen our platform for future growth. Second, we will continue to invest to capture the unique opportunities presented by current market conditions. It is a tremendously exciting time in both healthcare and higher education. The markets are changing rapidly and we must offer the research, software and services to meet member needs during this tumultuous time. By doing so, we both provide outstanding value to our members and deliver sustained, strong company growth at scale. As such new product development remains critical priority for the entire executive team and I am confident that our strategy will be key to continue our growth trajectory in the future. Third, we will continue to drive flawless commercial execution across the firm. The energy behind our commercial operations continues to be outstanding and motivating to all functions across the business. Our ongoing innovation in the initiatives to drive warm leads, improved relationship building, leveraged intelligence gathering on specific areas of member needs, enhanced collateral positioning and developed innovative promotion strategies has proven to be an exciting and successful undertaking. With strong results from our work here over the last couple of years, we are confident that these strategies will continue to perforate. Finally, investing in world class talented at all levels of the organization remains the top priority. Having the right organization in place was the critical factor on our ongoing ability to serve our members, and deliver on our commitment to investors. As such, building a scalable organization with top talent has been and continues to be a priority for both our board and our executive team, and I am confident that our attention to these issues sets up well to achieve our goals. We continue to focus on and have strong success in attracting, engaging, developing and retaining great talent, maintaining a culture based on our core values and creating an organization that’s structured for growth. Overall, we are remaining incredibly thankful to all our talented and dedicated employees who at the end of the day drive the performance that generates the strong financial results we are seeing. Thank you for participating in tonight’s call and why don’t we now take the time to answer your questions."

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you and good evening. I am Robert Musslewhite, Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a 3-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will open with a summary of our performance for the quarter and for our fiscal year, covering our financial results and the drivers of our business performance. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our key priorities for the remainder of the calendar year. As always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the call. Let me start with an overview of our financial results. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 increased 32.9% to $100.5 million from $75.6 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $0.62 per diluted share and $19.8 million respectively. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, revenue increased 30.7% to just over $370.3 million from $283.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $2.27 per diluted share and $70.3 million respectively, compared with $1.70 per diluted share and $47.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2011. We closed the quarter and the fiscal year with strong performance and are pleased to see last year's trends continuing into this year, with 33% revenue growth for the quarter and 31% contracts value growth over last year at this time, to a March 31, 2012 contract value of $398.3 million. Our membership base grew nearly 14% to 3,726 institutions as of the close of the fiscal year, yielding an average contract value per member of $106,901, up from approximately $96,000 last year. As always, one of the most important fiscal year end metrics is our renewal rate, since it reflects both product quality and member satisfaction, and is a critical factor in establishing our platform for future growth. This year, we achieved an overall renewal rate of 92%, the highest rate in our history. Collectively, our revenue growth, contract value growth, membership base expansion and renewal rate, illustrate the health of the business and are evidence that the continued complexity in the markets we serve is driving a deep and ongoing need for our products and services. The complexity has many sources for our healthcare members. Between the coming bullets of aging, sick or Baby Boomers and the growing budget orientation of healthcare purchasers ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to commercial insurers and employers, our members must develop care delivery strategies to prepare for both new demographic and new financing realities. In addition, these broader trends also mean that the shift toward value-based approaches to healthcare purchasing is not a passing fad. Whatever happens with politics, Supreme Court decisions and elections, it is clear that the industry will continue to look beyond traditional fee-for-service to structures that link payment to health outcomes. Thus, healthcare providers must continue to invest in strategies that permit the efficient delivery of better, more reliable care. These strategies include closer alignment with physicians, greater use of clinical data and analytics, relentless attention to quality and the use of the best clinical evidence, tighter integration across the care continuum and a strong focus on delivering value. We're uniquely well positioned to help deliver impact to our members around these strategies. And our Crimson portfolio provides a great example of the comprehensive resources that we can bring to bear to support members, however far along they are in the spectrum of preparation for value-based care. Our flagship Crimson membership helps foster closer alignment with physicians through a unique view of clinical utilization and care quality. Whether a hospital is just beginning to work towards value-based care or is already taking on financial risk for delivering value, Crimson's proven technology solution allows hospitals to work effectively with physicians, who are of course, key drivers of both quality and cost performance. Crimson Care Registry complements our flagship Crimson analytics with a dynamic workflow tool that harnesses clinical data and analytics, as well as best clinical evidence, to prompt physicians on recommended care for each individual patient. By improving physician decision-making at the point of care, Crimson Care Registry improves quality outcomes and is a key tool for proactive care management, a critical competency as new payment structures shift the risk for overall patient outcomes to providers. For those institutions ready to contract based on risk, our partnership with Milliman MedInsight further expands this capability, allowing members to manage total cost and quality for defined populations. As members turn to tighter integration across the care continuum, Crimson Market Advantage provides total market visibility on non-owned physician practices. And for those health systems a bit further down the integration path, those that own physician practices, Crimson Practice Management helps maximize the total health system contribution of the owned practices. Across all of these programs, what is really exciting to see is that a wide range of members, large and small, progressive and just beginning on the road to accountable care, is deriving value and improving performance as a result of the Crimson portfolio. Tomorrow, 600 hospital leaders will arrive in Orlando for our Crimson Performance Summit, a 2-day meeting focused on sharing best practice among the cohort. The agenda for the session is very rich and includes Advisory Board research on industry trends, product roadmap sessions and breakout sessions co- led by Crimson experts and peer member executives. What I predict will be the highlight of the session, though, is this year's inaugural Impact Expo, a full exhibition hall featuring more than fully demonstrated and memorialized member case studies. In the exhibition, members will see the story of the small, 100-bed hospital in the Northeast that leveraged Crimson to improve clinical management protocols for behavioral help to patients, reducing length of stay for annualized savings of more than $1 million. The story of the 300-bed hospital in the Mid-Atlantic, they used Crimson to improve utilization management and clinical performance for ventilated patients, optimizing utilization for annualized savings of more than $600,000. The story of the 10-hospital system in the Midwest that leveraged Crimson to launch care redesign across the health system for annualized cost savings of more than $2 million. And the story of the 5-hospital system in Texas that is aggressively assuming accountability for care using Crimson to track more than 100 quality measures and secure nearly $50 million in clinical integration risk- based contracts. The exhibition will be an energizing look at a range of success stories and will highlight the ways in which our Crimson portfolio is providing tangible impact in today's complex and changing healthcare environment. As in healthcare, this is also a time where higher education is undergoing significant transformation. Here too, we are thrilled to have a portfolio to support our members in an era of complexity. As a market, higher education shares many of the key attributes that make healthcare so well suited for our work. It is a large and fragmented market where government plays a big role. The sector faces challenges that are common to all institutions across geography, size and other differentiating factors. Like healthcare organizations, institutions of higher education also have a culture and objective [ph] of both seeking out and sharing best practices. There are also similarities in the amount of complexity our members currently face in both sectors. Healthcare is seeing a massive shift in the industry, one where the basis of competition is changing and roles are blurring across hospitals, physicians and payers. Higher education is also undergoing significant changes that bring tremendous complexity. As state and federal budgets tighten, and broader economic conditions affect individual student's ability to pay tuitions, universities are faced with the challenge of how to keep enrollments at adequate levels without sacrificing student quality. These pressures are creating new terrains for competition and a heightened focus on both attracting and retaining students. The critical relationship with faculty is also at the fore, as universities strategize about attracting and retaining faculty in a budget-constrained environment. Further, the increasing numbers of non-traditional students, often older students seeking higher education to improve job prospects in today's economy, provide a critical new constituency that must be taken into account by established institutions catering to recent high school graduates. Together, these trends highlight a set of university programs that have previously been treated largely with benign neglect at many colleges and universities: continuing and online education programs. Today, it's not just the traditional name brand institutions whom colleges and universities seek to emulate. It is also the Strayer Colleges of the world. In that context, I'm excited to announce today our new continuing and online education program, our fifth program in the education space. Research shows that non-traditional student enrollments are growing and that online instruction is making inroads even in the undergraduate core. Further, given leaner times ahead for higher education, provosts and chief business officers alike are increasingly interested in growing revenues from online instruction to fund other institutional objectives. The new focus on continuing and online education is resulting in increased scrutiny of these programs. No longer are they small programs left to do as they please. Academic leaders openly worry about quality. Accustomed to revenue predictability, the university's finance executives wrestle with the potential volatility of online program demand. Finally, provosts are examining both the role of continuing and online education within the larger institution, and how best to organize such efforts. The continuing and online education program is a renewable research program that provides best practice research, peer networking and benchmarking tools to help university business and academic leaders address these key operational and strategic issues. The program's robust initial research initiatives include: the data-driven enterprise focused on how programs should respond to greater demand for transparency and accountability; new channels, new markets; exploring the use of social media and the nascent market for international students; elevating the student experience to understand how to engage and build lifelong relationships with adult learners; and hot industries, hot jobs; focus this year on how universities can help meet the workforce needs in the healthcare and sustainable energy sectors. Members of the new program are very engaged with these topics, and the program is off to an outstanding start. It is a great addition to our growing portfolio to meet the needs of our higher education members. Now, let me turn things over to Michael to review our financial results in greater detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around 6 categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, our 2-for-1 stock split and the outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2012. First the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. For the quarter just ended, our revenue from continuing operations increased to 32.9%, to $100.5 million, up from $75.6 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending March 31, 2012, increased 67% to $19.8 million, up from $11.8 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted net income was $11.1 million compared to $7.3 million last year. And non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.62 compared to $0.43 last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, exclude transaction-related costs and amortization, equity and loss of unconsolidated entity, gains and losses of investment in common stock warrants, gain on the sale and operations of discontinued operations, as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including transaction-related costs and amortization, equity and income of an unconsolidated entity, gains and losses of investment in common stock warrants, gain on sale and operations of discontinued operations, as well as share-based compensation expense, GAAP net income and income per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, were $8.2 million and $0.46 respectively. Costs of services increased to $55 million or 54.7% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared to $40 million or 52.9% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increases in cost of services are due to increased expenses for our new and growing programs, primarily related to our physician products, as well as newly incorporated costs from our acquisition of PivotHealth in August 2011. Also included in cost of services for the 3 months ending March 31, 2012, was a $1.4 million fair value adjustment to our various acquisition-related earn out liabilities. Member relations and marketing expense was $19.1 million or 19% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared to $16.5 million or 21.9% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. We currently have 155 sales teams in place, an increase from the 145 sales teams in place in the quarter ended March 31, 2011. G&A expense increased to $12.8 million or 12.7% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2012, compared to $10.6 million or 14% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year, due primarily to an increase in personnel costs and infrastructure investments in our IT, legal and finance functions to support our growing employee base. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $2.7 million or 2.7% of revenue compared to $1.7 million or 2.2% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year, due to increased amortization from capital investments in our growing technology programs as well as additional depreciation from leasehold improvements relating to new space in our Austin and Washington D.C. office space. Other income net in the quarter was $164,000 compared to $588,000 in the same period of the prior year. This quarter's other income consisted of interest income of $698,000 plus a gain of $116,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members and a non-cash loss in the value of common stock warrants of $650,000. During the quarter ended March 31, 2011, we had interest income of $536,000 and a gain of $52,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to our fiscal year income statement results, for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, revenue from continuing operations increased 30.7% to $370.3 million, up from $283.4 million last year. GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012, were $25.3 million and $1.46 respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $70.3 million, $39.4 million and $2.27 respectively for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012, compared to $47.3 million, $27.9 million and $1.70 respectively for fiscal 2011. Turning to the balance sheet, membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased to $288.8 million as of March 31, 2012, compared to $176.6 million as of March 31, 2011. Gross DSOs, which we calculate using average receivables, were 252 days as of March 31, 2012, and were 219 days as of March 31, 2011. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs on billed AR were 56 days as of March 31, 2012, up from 50 days as of March 31, 2011. Deferred revenue, net of amounts that we billed after 12 months, increased to $399.7 million as of March 31, 2012, up from $262.8 million as of March 31, 2011. Excluding long-term deferred and prepaid contracts, the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2012 was $311 million, up 41% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the 3 months ended March 31, 2012, our cash generated from operating activities was $25.7 million, an increase of 53% compared to $16.8 million in the same period last year. For the fiscal ending March 31, 2012, cash flow generated from operations was $92.8 million, an increase of 83% over $50.5 million in fiscal year of 2011. For fiscal year 2012, cash flow from operations was 2.4x adjusted net income compared to 1.8x for fiscal year 2011. Capital expenditures for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012 were approximately $7.4 million, compared to $3.5 million for the 3 month ended March 31, 2011. This increase is due to increased levels of investment associated with our analytical tools program this year as well as $2.2 million of expenditures related to the build out of additional space at our Washington D.C. and Austin, Texas, office locations. As of March 31, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $188.1 million, representing approximately $10.58 per diluted share. As to contract value, the contract value from continuing operations increased to 30.9% to $398.3 million as of March 31, 2012, up from $304.3 million as of March 31, 2011, which excludes $5.8 million from discontinued operations included in March 2011. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts with more than 12 months duration, we include only 12 months in contract value. Our 2-for-1 stock split. The company announced that the Board of Directors had approved a 2-for-1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. On June 18, 2012, each stockholder of record will receive 1 additional share of common stock for each share of common stock owned at the close of business, Eastern Time on May 31, 2012. On completion of the stock split, the number of outstanding shares in the company's common stock will double to approximately 34 million shares. Additional information about the stock split will be posted on the company's website. Finally, with respect to the outlook for the reminder of calendar 2012, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions as outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2012, we continue to expect revenue to be in a range of approximately $420 million to $430 million, with consistent quarter-over-quarter sequential growth for the rest of the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of approximately $77 million to $82 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in a range of approximately $2.40 to $2.60, with earnings relatively evenly distributed across the year due to back-weighted investment spending. For calendar year 2012, we expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $13.5 million and amortization from acquisition-related intangibles to be approximately $5 million. For calendar year 2012, we expect an effective tax rate in a range of approximately 38% to 38.5%. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about the year ahead and then we'll take any questions you have. As I mentioned in our last call, our focus in 2012 is on innovation across the organization, and the entire firm continues to execute against our detailed innovation action plan. This is especially important as we enter the second calendar quarter, a very important time from a sales and renewals perspective, as each year we expect to do a high volume of business during, and especially at the end of, this quarter. And strong performance this quarter is important in setting up our financial performance for the remainder of the calendar year. The plan has 5 key components. First, deliver member value in new ways. We continue to actively work to enhance the research, software, service and impact we provide to members of all of our programs, with hundreds of member interactions per day, we have a unique window into our members' needs and have developed protocols to ensure that we are leveraging this insight, both in service of our individual members and also to build our own intelligence on macro level needs of the membership. By doing both, we're able to not only to execute on the relationships, stewardship and cultivation so key to our success, but also to translate the intelligence into new product launches that meet and even anticipate member needs. This of course is critical for our second part of our innovation action plan, continue a relentless focus on growth. Today's market complexity and change continue to provide unprecedented opportunities to develop novel means of supporting our members. And our success will depend upon our ability to rapidly take advantage of opportunities with new product launches and extensions. Given the importance of speed to market and the success of our past acquisitions, including Crimson, Southwind and Concuity, we continue to look at acquisitions as a complement to organic new product development. With resources set against both organic NPD and business development, I'm confident that we will continue our track record of new product development success. Third, strengthen our go-to-market model. We will continue to build on our recent innovations in branding in our commercial organization with new work to migrate toward deeper and more powerful commercial relationships across our portfolio. These include increasing coordination across the portfolio, refining our strategic marketing to raise brand awareness and inbound product interest and leveraging technology to enhance relationship efforts. It is an exciting time in our commercial organization and our progress here is creating tremendous energy. Fourth, enhance our organizational infrastructure and agility. Our growth means that we must be creative in serving business needs, while also driving scale. Therefore, we continue to focus on making internal processes more efficient, increasing visibility and communications and making technology enhancements to support our work.

Thank you for participating in tonight's call and we will now open up the line for your questions."
187,GV_145042_2014Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to The Advisory Board Company's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Your host for the call today is Mr. Robert Musslewhite, Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company.

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you, and good evening. I'm Robert Musslewhite, Chairman and CEO of The Advisory Board and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a 3-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2013, covering our financial results, as well as the discussion of some of the notable developments of the quarter. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our key operational and strategic priorities. As always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended June 30, 2013, Advisory Board revenues increased 18% to $123.2 million from $104.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012. Net income was $3.7 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to $3.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $22.5 million for the quarter compared to $20.2 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Contracts value increased 16% to $475.8 million as of June 30, 2013, up from $411.6 million as of June 30, 2012. Our continued strong performance this quarter is due to the superior value we provide to our members through our comprehensive portfolio of offerings, outstanding member service and excellent product quality. Our more than 4,100 health care and higher education members face tremendous complexity due to demographic shift, revenue pressure, a new value orientation and transformation of their business models. With an overall member renewal rate of 90%, we are clearly the partner of choice as members seek both to enhance performance in the current environment and to set strategy to succeed in the future. The reason why is clear. At all levels of the firm, we are fully focused on driving tangible results for our members. We recently held an internal forum for staff to share member results with the executive team and the stories were tremendous in both quantity and quality. I thought that sharing a few would illustrate the many deep ways we are working in partnership with our members to solve their most pressing problems. One staff member explained the work he had been doing with a midwestern 500-bed hospital through Crimson, our software-based program focused on physician management. The tool revealed that the hospital had a $2.5 million cost-reduction opportunity in a particular psychiatric diagnosis. Armed with data from the analytic tool and his clinical background, our dedicated advisor was able to engage hospital psychiatric leadership team to pursue this opportunity. We successfully worked with the physicians to develop and implement new evidence-based protocols, inter-disciplinary rounds and other best practices. The result of this hard work and physician culture change, was reduced lengths of stay, cost and readmissions. Overall, the hospital achieved an average savings per case of over $2,000, resulting in an annualized cost savings of more than $2 million. Another staff member discussed her work with the 9 hospital system in the south through our nursing operations performance program. Our team worked with the chief nursing officer of the health care system to drive performance improvement throughout the system. By engaging the CNOs at each facility, our team was able to improve performance on a unit-by-unit basis across the entire health system, leveraging our software tool to identify individual units with cost and quality variances, establishing action plans and timelines for each and driving accountability for improvement. The hard work resulted in improvements at every facility for an overall decrease in the use of premium labor by over 78,000 hours. The result in savings totaled $5.5 million. A third staff member described the impact that we had with Crimson Market Advantage at a 500-bed hospital that is the flagship of a multi-hospital system in the Midwest. The hospital is located on the fringe of a highly competitive urban market and needed to defend and grow surgical market share in the face of a new competitor entering the market. Through Crimson Market Advantage, the hospital used their data-driven approach to target and strengthen relationships with key specialists and referring primary care physicians. The targeted outreach efforts resulted in $5 million in adjusted new revenue over 4 months. Across all our memberships, there are stories like these of tangible return on investment that our members received through their work with us. Given these results, the case to continue and expand advisory board relationships is an easy one for members to make. The value proposition of membership is clear. Another key part of our value proposition to members is the insight we offer on critical strategic questions. Members value our deep expertise, extensive knowledge base and ability to make sense of the changing landscapes in their industries. Our annual series of health care CEO roundtable meetings always puts the best of our strategic insight on full display, with presentations that both cover the State of the Union and healthcare sector and address the key up-at-night questions for our top executive members. Registration for this year's series has been record-breaking with nearly all of our member institutions represented. The popularity of these sessions and members' outstanding feedback on them indicates that this year's agenda is of particular interest. Perhaps that is not surprising, given our message, which is somewhat counterintuitive. Much of what the industry has been focused on has been the threat to hospitals' margins and traditional business models, the aging population that is sicker and will be costlier to treat, the reimbursement changes that the government and commercial insurers are making to fee for service reimbursements and new entrants from outside the traditional provider universe that increased competition. Our work explores these issues, of course, but is more focused on the opportunities that today's market present for hospitals and health systems, ways they can control their own destiny and succeed in the new health care economy. The research we present details how organizations willing to take intelligent risks can grow market share, market footprint and market impact by delivering distinctive solutions to a range of purchasers from payers to employers to individuals that address the particular problems purchasers know that they have today, as well as those that will become apparent as the population ages and our economy evolves. With outstanding meeting scores and member feedback, it is clear that the growth- focused meeting agenda has really resonated with our members' CEOs. Given our members' focus on intelligent growth, our Crimson Market Advantage program has continued to perform very well. Tighter integration across the care continuum is and will continue to be important in a variety of growth scenarios. Under current fee-for-service conditions, Crimson Market Advantage provides total market visibility on non-owned physician practices to help drive referrals to the hospital. Under newer integrated reimbursement models, where hospitals might own physician practices, Crimson Market Advantage helps maximize the total health system contribution at the owned practices. We recently acquired MRS [ph], a small Tucson-based technology company that we expect will complement and bolster our work with the large and growing Crimson Market Advantage membership. As with our typical acquisition, we will spend the next several months working to scale their organization and its technology and prepare sales teams for a new product launch, which we expect to announce in an upcoming quarter. We also expect the financial impact to be similar to that of our typical acquisition with some near-term dilution as we make these investments but strong contribution to our growth in earnings over the next several years as we build out products incorporating the technology and sign on new members to these programs. Before I turn things over to Michael, I wanted to give a quick update on our work in higher education. Since we launched our first higher education membership in 2007, we have continued to grow our scalable, thriving practice, leveraging the lessons we learned from building our Health Care business. We now have more than 500 member institutions, ranging from Ivy League universities such as Harvard and Dartmouth, to large state schools like Arizona State and LSU, to community colleges including Ivy Tech and Technical College System of Georgia. Our 5 research memberships serve the provost, the head of student affairs, the top university business executive and leader of continuing an online education, as well as the leaders of community colleges. Collectively, the programs take on a dozen major research initiatives each year, complemented with nearly 600 shorter reports for smaller audiences. For example, our university business executive program has developed a robust set of resources on the key topics for this constituency. The research covers strategic topics such as alternative revenues, globalization and risk management and also more tactical topics including managing energy costs, procurement and space management. And the membership is currently hosting its annual meeting series with the keynote presentations representing this mix of strategic and operational and it is garnering very strong feedback. Our work with provost is another highlight within our education memberships. Our recent meeting series for this constituency has also been well received, with comments like, ""This is my first provost roundtable and I'm so glad I attended,"" ""It was wonderful and far more helpful to me than any other conference."" And, ""Really cutting-edge information and just-in-time strategies,"" and ""Great environment for interaction and learning."" In addition to this feedback, the value stories from our provost were also impressive. One prestigious private university that we have worked with had seen a drop in endowment income during the recession and felt significant pressure not to raise tuition given value questions in a market where many recent graduates struggle to find jobs. Struggling to chart a valuable course forward, the provost came to one of our national meetings that included research on online and continuing education. Despite her skepticism about the value and quality of these channels, our research showed her that more than a few prestigious private schools had seen tremendous success with online degree programs and have seen no degradation in quality. She ended up bringing in one of our experts for a day-long retreat with their deans and the university president. Across the day, the group decided to make online education a key part of the university's strategy and to move forward aggressively into this area, and we have supported their subsequent successful implementation of several professional masters programs. As you can see, our work in the higher education market has given us an excellent vantage point on the most pressing problems facing institutions of learning today. Foremost among them is improving student success. Universities have never been under more pressure to improve graduation rates. With national 5- year graduation rates barely above 50%, both the public at large and key funders are growing impatient. An increasing number of states are tying higher education funding to graduation rate performance, and colleges and universities are finding that the traditional focus on first-year student retention and investments in other support services are not succeeding in inflecting performance. In this context, am pleased to announce today our Student Success Performance Program, our first software-based program for our higher education members. Leveraging the most innovative in and out of industry ideas, the Student Success Program combines technology, research and predictive analytics into a renewable membership to help institutions positively inflect outcomes with at-risk and off-path students. Recognizing that most institutions have amassed a wealth of untapped economic data, we partner with progressive institutions to uncover hidden insights about the patterns of academic success and failure and deliver this actionable intelligence to the advisors and retention specialists who work directly with students. The program is off to a good start with a robust charter membership that includes Rutgers University, Indiana University, University of Missouri, University of North Florida and Georgia State University. We're excited about the growth potential of software-based memberships for the higher education market, and we view this launch as the first step in leveraging our research beachhead to build a business serving colleges and universities with our software and analytics. Let me now turn the agenda over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around 6 categories: income statement; balance sheet; cash flow; contract value; our recent acquisition; and outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2013. First, the income statement. A quick reminder on our March 31 fiscal yearend, which means that we just finished the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. For the quarter just ended, revenue increased 18.3% to $123.2 million, up from $104.1 million in the same period the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending June 30, 2013, was $22.5 million, up from $20.2 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted net income was $11.4 million compared to $11.1 million last year, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.31 compared to $0.31 last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarter ending June 30, 2013 and 2012 exclude transaction-related cost and amortization, equity and loss from unconsolidated entity, as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the quarter ending June 30, 2013, were $3.7 million and $0.10, respectively. Cost of services increased to $66 million or 53.5% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2013, compared to $58.4 million or 56% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase in the cost of services are due to increased expense for new and growing programs, inclusive of our acquisitions of ActiveStrategy and 360Fresh during the prior fiscal year, netted by lower fair value charges from our acquisition-related earnings and our liabilities when compared to last June. Member relations and marketing expense were $22.2 million or 18% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2013, compared to $19.1 million or 18.4% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. G&A expense increased $18 million or 14.6% of revenue in the quarter ended June 30, 2013, compared to $13.5 million or 12.9% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year, due primarily to an increase in investment in our IT infrastructure to support our growing employee base and number of office locations, as well as increased investments in our new product development and corporate development groups. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $6.4 million or 5.2% of revenue compared to $4.1 million or 3.9% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increase is due to capital investments in our growing technology programs, the recent ActiveStrategy and 360Fresh acquisitions, as well as additional depreciation from leasehold improvements related to expansion space in our Austin, Texas, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. offices. Other income net in the quarter was $522,000 compared to $576,000 in the same period the prior year. This quarter's other income consists of interest income of $852,000, a loss of $191,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members and $139,000 of fees related to our credit facility. During the quarter ended June 30, 2012, we had interest income of $824,000 and a loss of $248,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Turning to balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables was $387.2 million as of June 30, 2013, an increase of 20% compared to June 30, 2012. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs on billed AR were 61 days as of June 30, 2013, compared to 55 days as of June 30, 2012. Total deferred revenue, net of amounts that we build up to 12 months was $523 million as of June 30, 2013, an increase of 20% over June 30, 2012. Excluding long-term deferred, the current portion of deferred revenue balance as of June 30, 2013 was $411.6 million, up 19% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the 3 months ended June 30, 2013, our cash used from operating activities was $3.6 million compared to $2.4 million used in the same quarter of last year. We use historically our low cash flow during the year, due to timing of member payments in our annual bonus cycle. And for fiscal year 2014, we continue to expect cash flow to generate from operations to be on our typical range of 1.5x to 2x adjusted net income. Capital expenditures for 3 months ending June 30, 2013, were approximately $11.7 million compared to $8.5 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2012. For 3 months ended June 30, 2013, we repurchased $6.2 million of stock or approximately 119,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $347 million or 15.7 million shares. As of June 30, 2013, the remaining authorized share repurchase amount was $103 million. As of June 30, 2013, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $192.1 million, representing approximately $5.25 per diluted share. At the contract value, contract value increased 15.6% to $475.8 million as of June 30, 2013, up from $411.6 million as of June 30, 2012. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. The contracts of more than 12 months duration include only 12 months of contract value. Turning to our recent acquisition. We're also announcing our purchase of MRS on July 8. MRS is a small Arizona-based technology firm with products that will supplement our existing position for our programs. The purchase price were approximately $11.5 million for standard escrows and no additional amount. We expect the acquisition to contribute minimal incremental revenue in calendar 2013, and expect EBITDA dilution for the remainder of this year to be approximately $2.5 million. With respect to the outlook for remainder of calendar 2013, the following comments are intended to follow into the safe harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions, which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2013, we're updating our revenue guidance to a range of approximately $500 million to $505 million, up from the previous range of $495 million to $505 million. Also as a result of the MRS acquisition, we are updating our guidance for calendar year 2013 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of approximately $87.5 million to $92.5 million, from a previous range of $90 million to $95 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in a range of approximately $1.15 to $1.25, from a previous range of $1.18 to $1.28. For calendar 2013, we expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $17.5 million, and expect amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets to be in the range of $7 million to $8 million. We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 to be approximately 38% to 39%. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I'd like to conclude with a few comments about our priorities headed into the second half of the calendar year and then we will take any questions you have. As I mentioned in our last call, we have 4 key priorities this year to ensure that we are making smart investments executing in a high standard and continuing to deliver world-class programs that drives significant returns for our members. Our 4 priorities are especially important right now as we are extremely focused at all levels on finishing out the year with good momentum. There first, ensuring outstanding member value. We continue to find new ways to enhance the research, software, service and impact we provide to members of all of our programs. The examples of member value I discussed at the beginning of this call, along with the many others that we hear from our members each day, illustrates that our focus here continues to pay off. Further, we are actively working on new projects that open up opportunity for us to have an even greater impact on health care and higher education across the country. Our health care work with the State of Rhode Island is one example. Most recently, we were selected to partner with the Gates Foundation to investigate the drivers of higher education costs. For the project, we will partner with several of our member institutions to explore the drivers of cost through the analysis of financial and programmatic data. It is a fantastic project, an intangible sign of our strong standing in the higher education market. It is very exciting to be engaging on the top industry issues in these new ways. Given the enormously complex challenges facing the sectors we serve, our members need our support at every level and 4,100 institutions are consistently turning to us to help them with their key challenges and top priorities. Second, continuing our relentless focus on growth. With our clear vision of future market and member needs based on our research expertise and relationships across the industry, we continue to come to market with the right products at the right time in order to carry out our growth formula. Our track record of strong acquisitions that bolster key capabilities and add value complements our organic growth through internal new program development and both approaches drive our continued cross-sell success. We continue to invest resources to ensure that we are developing and, where appropriate, acquiring the programs and capabilities to support our members in this time of tremendous change in our markets. Third, continuing to evolve our go-to-market model. Our new initiatives to further align our internal sales and account management organizations are proceeding well, and we are continuing to enhance our coordination and impact from members. The changes are allowing us to serve members more effectively and migrate to even deeper and more powerful commercial relationships across our portfolio. Our staff has done an outstanding job at implementing the new initiatives and they're constantly focused on both providing gold standard service and maximizing our ability to deepen and expand member relationships. Finally, we are consistently focused on attracting, cultivating, engaging and retaining world-class talent. With an employee base of 2,500 people and growing, doing so with scale has become a top priority. The executive team, along with our Board of Directors spend significant time here. We're focused on ensuring that we are hiring the best people with a wide range of skill sets, identifying talent across the organization, developing our employees, deploying them in the most leveraged ways and recognizing and rewarding them for the excellent work that they do. Our statistics show us that we have the right formula, with staff members at all levels rapidly advancing in their careers here and record level engagement and retention. Talent is our most important asset and will continue to be a top priority for me, our executive team and throughout the company. Let me close my prepared remarks here. Thank you for participating in tonight's call, and we'll now open up the line for your questions."
188,GV_145042_2014Q2,"Presentation Operator Welcome to The Advisory Board Company's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. Your host for the call today is Mr. Robert Musslewhite, Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company.

For additional information on the company's results and outlook, please refer to its second fiscal quarter news release. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. At this time, I will turn the call over to the company's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you, and good evening. I'm Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I'm joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a 3-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our performance for the quarter ended September 30, 2013, covering our financial results, a discussion of some of the key drivers of our performance and our acquisition of Care Team Connect. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials. And finally, I will close with an update on our top operational and strategic priorities, heading into the close of the calendar year. As always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the session. In the quarter ended September 30, 2013, The Advisory Board Company revenue increased 16% to $128.3 million from $110.8 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2012. Contract value grew to $491.3 million as of September 30, 2013, up from $435.1 million as of September 30, 2012. For the quarter ended September 30, 2013, net income was $9.0 million or $0.24 per diluted share compared to net income of $7.5 million or $0.21 per diluted share for the quarter ended September 30, 2012. For the quarter ended September 30, 2013, adjusted net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $11.4 million, $0.31 per diluted share and $22.3 million, respectively, compared with $11.4 million, $0.31 per diluted share and $20.8 million, respectively, for the same quarter last year. Overall, we are pleased with the continued performance of the business. In markets experiencing tremendous change and transformation, the member value we are providing is at an all-time high. In addition to outstanding meeting and QA scores, our growth indicates the impact we are having on our members' most important challenges. Reflecting the member value we are delivering, we continue to see strong sales and renewal momentum across the business. Across the September quarter, renewal rates continue to come in at or above historical highs, and we saw a bit of an uptick in new sales activity across our renewable programs in research and software, as members sought our help more than ever before. Health care members that are looking ahead at the changing environment are seeking key capabilities from us to support their transition in areas like population health and revenue cycle and higher education members facing increased scrutiny on value are trying to get ahead of the curve on student success metrics through our most recent technology launch. The only place where we fell short of what we were expecting in the quarter was in the practice management business within Southwind. There, we had a combination of existing large contracts reaching their conclusion, along with not closing several new large contracts that were in the pipeline, the combination of which impacted our contract value growth metric. Overall, Southwind is growing rapidly since joining The Advisory Board and it continues to be a tremendously valuable service for our members needing support in managing all aspects of their physician enterprises, so I'm optimistic that the September quarter is just an aberration of what has been steady and rapid growth. As we turn attention to the extremely important December quarter, we'll look to continue to capitalize on our overall renewal strength and our sales momentum in our renewable products, as well as ensure Southwind practice management sales get back on plan. Across all areas of the business, everyone is fully focused on flawless execution, commercial success and impact for our members. To that end, I'm excited to talk about how we are continuing to serve our health care members in new and differentiated ways against their most challenging set of issues. The top strategic issue for us or our health care members continues to be the transition from a system where incentives are based on the volume of care provided, number of tests, scans, procedures, et cetera, to a system where the value of care is the basis for financial reward. That is a system where providers are measured and rewarded on whether they are providing the best care in the most cost-effective manner possible. In many cases, this means that hospitals and other provider organizations are assuming the risk of providing care to particular populations, for example: Medicare patients, patients covered by a particular insurance contract or delegated lives from an employer and need to manage that population to the best possible health outcomes. This is a fundamental transformation of the provider business model; and our members, as well as other players across the industry, are seeking our help in effecting this change. I am very proud of how we are answering the call. For example, our flagship health system strategy membership program recently launched its national meeting series, which is focused on the new economics of growth in this changing market environment. Today, given the pressures on traditional inpatient-centric business models, many hospital and health system leaders feel they must choose between focusing on rapid cost restructuring and investing in their organization's futures. It is an easy trap to fall into, but trading off between austerity and growth is a false choice and one that health systems cannot afford to make. Although it can feel counterintuitive to our members, our research shows that it is imperative that they have both disciplined financial management and a commitment to investing in high-quality, low-cost pathways and outcomes. It is the only way they will be able to succeed in an economy determined to spend less, not more, on health care. Our meeting series focuses squarely on this message and provides an in-depth look at how leading health systems are executing on tomorrow's growth strategies today. Meeting sessions include not only a state of the union on the key forces shaping provider strategy, but also best practices in the ambulatory network design, insights on tailoring care management models for specific segments of a population and the application of behavioral economics to patient engagement. From the time of the announcement of the meeting's agenda, members have been incredibly engaged with this content. Registration has been outstanding. The meeting's 3.82 GPA is among the highest for this membership, and we are seeing attachment to this very strong content positively impact both sales and renewals. Another example of our work to address the transforming health care business model was the inaugural National Population Health symposium we hosted here in D.C. in mid-September. The purpose of the day was to bring together a diverse cross-section of parties participating in payment and delivery reform to share insights about opportunities and challenges they are uncovering in their work. This gathering was a new format for us, including representation from a wide variety of key population health players, both members and nonmembers. We had over 300 people in attendance from more than 200 different organizations, including hospitals, health systems, post-acute providers, home care companies, physician groups, insurance companies and federal and state governments. We built the day around 5 panel discussions, each with 4 panelists and an Advisory Board expert moderator. Across the day, the panelists described their experiences with accountable care organizations, bundled payments, medical homes, commercial risk contracting, population health IT and other new structures. We also heard from several high-profile individuals in government and public policy. Jon Blum, Deputy CMS Administrator and Director for the Center of Medicare; and Senator Tom Daschle, former U.S. Senate Majority Leader, each gave keynote addresses; and Farzad Montashari, National Coordinator for Health IT, led a roundtable discussion. The day was a resounding success. In fact, several of us noted that we have never heard the kind of buzz for meeting attendees that we heard that day. Across the day, multiple speakers and attendees made a point of thanking The Advisory Board for putting together such a diverse and progressive group, and several people told me that there's been nothing like this in the industry. The event sealed our position as a leading convener and expert on this important set of issues and continues to bolster our credibility and reputation, both inside and outside of our membership. Within our membership, we also continue to add to our deep set of resources for members on this issue. For example, we recently released a white paper on auditing the care management team, which profiles best practices on developing an effective care management function and measuring outcomes over time. We've also developed useful tools to help members evaluate a variety of population health investments and of course, our current national meeting series is squarely focused on this set of issues, with insights on how to develop the networks and care models that will allow members to both gain market share and proactively shape the competitive landscape. Across the population health research, it is clear that care management skills are essential and that the adoption of key air traffic controller technology to direct care team activities is a critical part of an effective infrastructure for future payment models. This technology effectively breaks down the silos of the delivery system and establishes a patient-level intervention that both improve the quality of care delivered and meet the new financial goals of a value-based delivery system. In that context, I am pleased to announce our acquisition of Care Team Connect. A 40-person company founded in Evanston, Illinois in 2008, Care Team Connect brings a comprehensive care management solution to assist providers in the coordination of patient care. The solution introduces a robust workflow engine into the care management process, enabling care team members across the continuum to build individualized care plans for the patient and to ensure that specific care tasks are completed. In our evaluation of solutions in this space, Care Team Connect's workflow tool was differentiated by the fact that it was designed specifically for the care coordination processes that provider organizations undertake, including appointment reminders, follow-ups and medication reconciliation. Driven by actionable data feed such as ADT feeds, historical claims and EMR clinical data, the Care Team Connect solution differs from the majority of others in the market, which were originally designed for payer use, based on claims data and uncoordinated with the patients' care team. Beyond just the technology, the Care Team Connect works in close partnership with provider organizations to design efficient coordination processes, so the collaborative care team is well supported by the technology. This collaboration drives tremendous impact towards the organization's specific goals, whether that be a particular at-risk contract, quality effort or pilot program. The new capabilities, we have fantastic addition to the Crimson clinical side of the business, and I'm excited that we will be bringing this technology to the market without delay. As such, I am pleased to announce today the launch of our newest program, Crimson Care Management, which leverages Care Team Connect's technology to serve member hospitals seeking to implement a workflow tool to build their population health management capabilities. We expect to be taking this new membership to many current Crimson members and are confident that the synergies between the programs will provide even greater impact for our existing Crimson membership. In fact, those of you who were at our Investor Day in September might recall a presentation by Dr. Jordan Asher of Michigan Pioneer ACO, MemorialCare in Fountain Valley, California and Integrated Health Partners in Battle Creek, Michigan. We are pleased to welcome Care Team Connect's talented staff to The Advisory Board Company. They have exceptional experience and expertise; and the company's values, service ethic and outstanding client relationships are a great fit with our own. I'm very excited about this infusion of talent and capabilities, and I look forward to our collective success. Let me now turn it over to Michael to review our financial results in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. Today's financial review Will cover 7 categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, our participation to Evolent's recent round of financing, our acquisition of Care Team Connect and outlook for the remainder year of calendar year 2013. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we are on our March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2014. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 15.9% to $128.3 million, up from $110.8 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending September 30, 2013, was $22.3 million, up from $20.8 million same period last year. Adjusted net income was $11.4 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.31 for both quarters ending September 30, 2013, and 2012. These adjusted numbers exclude transaction-related costs and amortization, equity and loss of unconsolidated entity, as well as share-based compensation expense. The reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the quarter ending September 30, 2013, were $9 million and $0.24, respectively. Cost of services increased to $69.9 million or 54.4% of revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2013, compared to $57 million or 51.5% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. The increases in cost of services are due to increased expenses for new and growing programs, inclusive of our acquisition of ActiveStrategy, 360Fresh and Medical Referral Source during the prior 12 months. Member relations and marketing expense were $22.2 million or 17.3% of revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2013, compared to $21.5 million or 19.4% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. We currently have 185 sales teams in place, up from 167 sales teams, as of the same quarter last year. G&A expense increased to $18 million or 14% of revenue in the quarter ending September 30, 2013, compared to $15.6 million or 14.1% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year, due primarily to an increase in investment in our corporate development and legal groups, as well as increased investment in our IT infrastructure to support our growing employee base in a number of office locations. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $6.9 million or 5.4% of revenue compared to $4.4 million or 4% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase is due to capital investment in our growing technology programs, the recent ActiveStrategy, 360Fresh and Medical Referral Source acquisitions, as well as additional depreciation from leasehold improvements relating to expansion space in our Austin, Texas; San Francisco, California; and Washington, D.C. offices. Other income net in the quarter was $1.1 million compared to $688,000 in the same period the prior year due to an increase in interest income. Now moving on to our fiscal year income statement results. For the 6 months ending September 30, 2013, revenue increased 17.1% to $251.6 million, up from $214.9 million last year. GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the 6 months ending September 30, 2013, were $12.7 million and $0.35, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and non- GAAP earnings per diluted share were $44.8 million, $22.7 million and $0.62, respectively, for the 6 months ending September 30, 2013, compared to $40.9 million, $22.5 million and $0.62, respectively, for the comparable period in the prior fiscal year. Turning to the balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, was $387.8 million as of September 30, 2013, compared to $319.2 million as of September 30, 2012. Excluding the effects of progress payments, average DSOs and billed AR were 58 days at September 30, 2013, compared to 53 days at September 30, 2012. Total deferred revenue net of amount that we billed after 12 months was $529 million as of September 30, 2013, an increase of 17% over September 30, 2012. Excluding long-term deferred, the current portion of deferred revenue balance as of September 30, 2013, was $405.5 million, up 18% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the 3 months ending September 30, 2013, our cash flow provided by operating activities was $39.2 million, compared to $43.7 million in the same quarter last year. For the 6 months ending September 30, 2013, cash flow generated from operations was $35.6 million compared to $40.9 million the prior fiscal year. For fiscal 2014, we continue to expect cash flow generated from operations to be in our typical range of 1.5 to 2x adjusted net income. Capital expenditures for the 6 months ended September 30, 2013, were approximately $25.9 million compared to $16.3 million for the 6 months ended September 30, 2012. For the 3 months ending September 30, 2013, we purchased $5 million of stock or approximately 87,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $352 million or 15.8 million shares. As of September 30, 2013, the remaining authorized share repurchase balance was $98 million. As of September 30, 2013, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $200.2 million, representing approximately $5.43 per diluted share. At the contract value, contract value increased 12.9% to $491.3 million as of September 30, 2013, up from $435.1 million as of September 30, 2012. We define contract value the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect in any given point of time, without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts of more than 12 months' duration, we only include 12 months of contract value. Returning to our investment, Evolent. At September 23, 2013, we participated in Evolent Series B preferred stock issuance. We invested $20 million in the Series B offering, of which $10 million was new cash investment and $10 million was conversion of our notes receivable purchase Evolent earlier in the year. After our recent investment, we now have an ownership stake for approximately 25% in Evolent. Looking at our recent acquisition, we're also announcing the purchase of Care Team Connect on October 7. Care Team Connect is an Illinois-based technology firm with products that will supplement our existing suite of population health offerings. The purchase price is approximately $35.2 million, with standard escrows and no additional earn-out. Care Team Connect's last 12 months of revenue was approximately $1.5 million and last 12 month's EBITDA is a loss of about $3.5 million. We anticipate less than $1 million of dilution for the remainder of this calendar year, given the timing, and expect approximately $4 million to $6 million of dilution from the acquisition in calendar 2014. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar 2013, the following comments were intended to fall under the Safe Harbor Provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions, which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2013, we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of roughly $500 million to $505 million; adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of approximately $87.5 million and $92.5 million; and non- GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $1.15 to $1.25, inclusive of the impact of Care Team Connect acquisition. For calendar 2013, we continue to expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $17.5 million and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets to be in the range of $7 million to $8 million. For fiscal 2014, we expect an effective tax rate in the range of approximately 38% to 39%. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. As we have discussed in the past, the December quarter is always an important one for us, given that approximately 40% of our sales and renewals take place during this period. In that context, this time of the year is one of great intensity for our teams, with everyone tremendously focused on outstanding execution to continue our strong performance and set us up well for the coming year. Our 4 key priorities continue to guide us as we work to meet our goals. As always, our top concern is ensuring continued outstanding value delivery to members. Given the mission-driven staff we have at all levels of the firm, this is really embedded in our collective DNA. From providing outstanding service to delivering product innovation to documenting member value creation from our programs, our teams are always very focused here. Last month at our Revenue Cycle Summit, we recognized Houston Methodist, Kalispell Regional Medical Center and Methodist Health System, 3 organizations that, through their work with us, achieved collective revenue cycle performance improvements of over $10 million. Delivering this type of member value solidifies our trusted position with the executives we serve and drives both our ability to meet new member needs and a continued growth of our business. Second, we'll continue to ensure we execute at a high standard across the firm. This time of year is all about discipline, hard work and attention to detail; and everyone across the firm knows that this trifecta is required in order to continue our track record of success. In particular, our commercial organization, sales, marketing and renewals is fully staffed and bolstered by the tools and member intelligence they need to perform. All teams know that strong execution now sets up next year, yielding the revenue to invest in the future while also delivering bottom line expansion. I'm confident that we have in place the right plan, talent and tools to continue to achieve our goals. Third, we will continue to focus on growth and invest in new product development efforts. Both health care and higher education are going through tremendous changes, and these changes in the markets we serve present unique business opportunities for us. We continue to invest in our portfolio of products and services to be certain that we are capitalizing on these opportunities and meeting members' new and changing needs. Our recent acquisitions are examples of our ongoing work to expand our offerings in new and complementary ways. In addition to strategic acquisitions, we also continue to invest in organic development of new programs to serve our members. Our track record provides us confidence in our ability to develop and integrate new capabilities that meet member needs, and we will continue this formula going forward. Finally, we remain focused on cultivating world-class talent at all levels of the organization. Our exceptional talent is our most important differentiator as a company. Over this last year, I've had the pleasure of recognizing employee milestones at all levels of the company, from 5-year anniversaries to one 30-year anniversary. It's been fantastic to see firsthand the amazing contributions our employees are making at every tenure level. Our company growth has provided unparalleled opportunities for new assignments, new skill development, promotion and advancement. This, along with our unique culture, has led to unprecedented levels of retention and engagement among our employee base. We also continue to invest in robust training and development, accelerated programs for exceptional performers and our women's leadership group. Our talent focus is widely recognized. Most recently, we are proud to have just been named the top place to work on Modern Healthcare's Best Places to Work, Large Companies list. While these types of recognitions are wonderful, what is most gratifying is working with this tremendous team to drive meaningful impact on health care and higher education. I'm confident that our talent base will continue to build on The Advisory Board Company's success. Thank you for participating in tonight's call. We will now take your questions."

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Musslewhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO : Thank you. Good evening. I’m Robert Musslewhite, CEO of The Advisory Board, and I’m joined today by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. This, our February call, is in many ways our most important call each year. In today's discussion, we recap our full calendar year results which, because we operate the business on a calendar year basis, give the most complete reflection of our overall performance. It is also our moment of greatest visibility into our forward growth with over 85% of our revenue fully visible for the upcoming year. Thus, we are also providing our guidance for calendar year 2013 at this time. We have a three-part agenda for this evening's call. First, I will give you a summary of our quarter and calendar year ended December 31, 2012, covering our financial results and the drivers of our business performance. I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials and other key performance metrics, as well as our guidance for calendar year 2013. Finally, I'll close with updates on our strategic and operational priorities for the year ahead. Of course, as always, we will be happy to take questions at the end of the call. Revenue for the quarter increased 18% to $116.2 million from $98.5 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2011. Net income was $4.4 million or $0.12 per diluted share compared to $8.1 million or $0.23 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $19.3 million for the quarter compared to $18.9 million in the quarter ending December 31, 2011. On a calendar year basis, revenue increased 25% to $431.6 million from $345.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was up 30% to $80 million for the year compared to $61.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2011. Contract value grew 18% to $450 million as of December 31, 2012, up from $380.7 million as of December 31, 2011. With calendar year 2012 closed, we are pleased to have delivered another year of strong revenue and contract value growth with expanding margins. Our results last year were once again driven by exceptional member attachment to the measurable value that we provide, our continued product innovation through 4 new launches and an ongoing robust new product development pipeline and our embedded relationships with members as evidenced by our 92% institutional renewal rate announced last March. Our investments in new products and services for our members have been critical to our ability to both provide members what they need in this time of tremendous complexity and take advantage of today's unique market dynamics to grow our business and expand our footprint in our industry. In all, our robust performance in 2012 sets us up for another strong year in 2013. With the tremendous visibility inherent in our model, we are pleased to provide guidance into another year of continuing to execute our proven formula with strong growth and solid bottom line performance. We will also continue to make a number of important investments in the business to set up future revenue growth and sustain our rapid expansion. These investments, as always, are driven by our members. The changing complexity of today's health care market are creating acute need for hospitals and health systems, and our members are trained to ask more than ever before. They're coming to us for solutions across research, software and services to help with 2 major categories of up-at-night issues. First, members continue to be concerned about margin pressure from the demographic and economic trends that are increasing the publicly insured rolls and constraining pricing for services. As such, they clearly feel the imperative to move to sustainable cost structures in the near term. At the same time given the increasing focus on value by health care purchasers across the board, including payers, employers and patients, our members know that payment structures based on volumes will likely shift over time to payment structures where providers will be rewarded based on care quality and efficiency. Therefore, they are also seeking guidance about how to develop over the medium term the capability to effectively manage population health and take on risk. Together, these trends mean that our members are coming to us for help in the critical undertaking of evolving their business models to deliver low-cost, value-based care across a variety of care settings. As such, we have made investments and allocated resources across our portfolio to address these issues for them. On the research insight side, these topics have been at the center of our research agendas for the year across all our programs. For example, our recent meetings series for nurse executives included insights on maximizing nurse productivity, a key in controlling health system cost; and also, delivering effective cross-continuum care, which is critical on the shift towards value-based care. Among our key research initiatives for our cardiology program this year, we're both establishing a fiscally sound cardiac strategy amid economic constraints and leveraging health IT to deliver value and coordinate care across cardiac services. And as I mentioned in our last call, our flagship health system strategy program for CEOs launched its national meeting series, Risk and Reward, in the fall. In more than 20, 2-day meetings across the country, more than 3,000 member executives are engaging with our research and insights on this topic. Feedback on the meeting continues to be outstanding with 3.8 grade point averages and members making comments like, ""This was the best Advisory Board meeting I've attended in the past 5 years."" As you can see our focus across our existing programs is squarely placed on members' key challenges of attaining sustainable cost structures in the near term while simultaneously building new capabilities to bear risk over the longer term. We've also been investing to develop new products and capabilities to support members in these aims, and I'm excited to announce several of them today. First, on the cost front, I'm pleased to announce the launch of our strategic sourcing program. This new software-based program serves health system supply chain executives by providing the tools and related support to deliver significant cost savings on critical clinical supplies typically known as physician preference items. These non-commoditized medical devices and supplies are found most frequently in the cardiac, orthopedics and neurosurgery product lines and include such items as catheters and stents, hip and knee implants, and Orthobiologics like bone and tissue. The purchase of these items is generally driven largely by physician choice and physician preference item expense is a tremendous factor in hospital cost structures. This area of the hospital supply chain has long been a challenge because of its complexity and interplay with clinician decisions, and many supply chain efforts have focused instead on more straightforward areas of cost containment. However, as margin concerns continue and most organizations have exhausted standard practices for cost reduction, market realities are challenging executives to find next generation savings. To meet this market need, we analyze data in our existing supply chain performance program database and conducted interviews with suppliers in progressive member institutions across the country. In this research, our teams uncovered several key characteristics of top-performing organizations that undertake broad strategic sourcing. First, these organizations create tremendous leverage when negotiating with suppliers by moving away from negotiating single contracts and combining spend for multiple categories in their negotiations. Second, best practice organizations drive significant competition in their negotiations and provide detailed feedback to suppliers about the competitiveness of their quotes. Third, these organizations collaborate with end-users such as physicians to evaluate the true total cost of vendor proposals, understand the impact of complex trade-offs and implement highly compliant contract awards. Of course, all of this is hard to do particularly at scale across multiple service lines and categories of supplies. It is in this context that we developed our strategic sourcing program, which combines the best- of-breed E-sourcing technology with our intellectual property on supply chain management and deep category expertise to help members consistently maximize leverage, drive competition and evaluate total cost savings opportunities across the vast majority of their spend. In our early pilots of this program, we've already achieved outstanding savings with even previously top decile performers seeing significant additional savings. For example, through our dynamic bidding process, Meriter Health Services in Wisconsin saved nearly $900,000 annually on orthopedic implants with its incumbent supplier. At Beaumont Health System in Michigan, executives used our data to engage physicians in weighing different supplier options. Ultimately, given full transparency of information, the physicians chose to shift market share on bone and tissue supplies in order to secure more than $600,000 in annual savings. One other early member stated, ""This was the easiest sourcing project I've ever been involved in."" Not only did we squeeze incremental savings over our top decile performance, but The Advisory Board did all the heavy lifting. The strategic sourcing program is off to a great start and we are excited to see its continued development across this year. Turning to the other of our members' key challenges, we also have 2 additional announcements today about ways we are enhancing our portfolio in order to help our members build new capabilities to bear risk over the longer term. As payers are increasingly holding hospitals accountable for not only cost but also quality outcomes, our members need to improve their ability to inflect care in realtime and at the point of service. To that end, I'm pleased to announce today the launch of our patient experience program based on the iRound technology which we acquired last year through our acquisition of ActiveStrategy. As I explained in our last call, the iRound platform combines mobile collection of behavioral and observational data with realtime point of care service recovery capabilities. Used in a provider setting, this approach to managing patient experience addresses the key shortcoming of traditional patient satisfaction survey methodologies by empowering frontline staff to respond immediately to unmet patient needs. The analytics also feed into executive dashboards that display unit level insights on performance and highlight major gaps in service quality. We are, of course, leveraging our knowledge of best practices in technology implementation and delivery from our existing portfolio of performance technology products to enhance this robust technology. The patient experience program includes our typical Dedicated Advisor support to ensure each organization maximizes the potential of the tool, as well as the ability to tap into our internal expertise in member networks for best practice sharing, peer networking, collaboration and, over time, benchmarking. The power of the program is that it does not just measure patient satisfaction, it provides health systems the tools to improve patient experience through realtime workflow applications. The wraparound services we're adding to the technology will help to ensure members realize that improvement opportunity. We've been introducing the program to our existing members through our national meeting series for chief nursing executives. With the vast majority of the executives who preview the program requesting a visit from our sales teams, we are very pleased with the initial positive market response and look forward to a strong run this year. Finally, I'm also pleased to make one more announcement. All of our member hospitals and health systems have made enormous investments in EMRs and a multitude of other systems and ensure they comply with government mandates to digitize patient medical records and use them across the organization. The result is that today, hospitals have an increasing amount of clinical data that resides in multiple places across different IT systems. The problem is that this data is locked into these cumbersome workflow systems and heavy data warehouses. And despite its promise, the data is not being used effectively to inflect the most important clinical decisions. So our members have continued to seek ways to unlock the power and value of this data and there are a very few solutions that deliver them. In that context, I'm excited to announce today the acquisition of 360Fresh, a unique technology that transforms patient data from a variety of information systems into actionable insights to improve care quality, reduce cost and enhance productivity for health systems. 360Fresh leverages text analytics and advanced statistical modeling to predict patient outcomes and target interventions in realtime. 360Fresh goes beyond traditional clinical decision support, moving us further down the path toward more and more valuable dynamic clinical intelligence, a capability that's increasingly in demand both as return on the incredible IT investments these institutions have made and as the health market -- health care market moves toward value-based payment structures. Let me explain. Clinical decision support implements no rules to alert caregivers to things like duplications, contraindications and allergies. For example, clinical decision support might provide a warning if a new prescription has a negative interaction with an existing one. So if a physician were writing a prescription for ibuprofen for a patient on a blood thinner, an alert would pop up pointing out the potential negative interaction between the 2 drugs. With its advanced analytics, 360Fresh is not only able to alert against known rules like this but also to make predictions about likely patient paths and outcomes. For example, it's extremely valuable for hospitals to be able to predict the length of stay in the intensive care unit following cardiac surgery in order to optimize ICU usage. However, this is not a simple proposition. Hospitals know the patients cannot be moved out of the ICU until they can meet specific criteria concerning breathing, circulatory function, temperature and blood temperature stability. Using dynamic clinical intelligence and combining patient-specific data from before the surgery, as well as data collected during the first hour in the ICU, we can help determine the likelihood that a patient will meet these stability criteria and therefore leave the ICU within a certain period of time. For example, an 8-hour shift. This type of prediction is difficult and requires several things. First, you need to have all the patient data together in one place. Typically resides in several pilot informations both within the outside the hospital. Further, it all needs to be in a common format to be usable for modeling, and the models themselves need to be created to make the predictions and calculate the expected outcomes in realtime. 360Fresh has the ability to do a streamlined acquisition of key clinical data elements from a broad array of information systems. For example, in-patient EMR, lab and order systems, ambulatory EMR and claim systems, and to normalize the data to create a consistent set of information for analytics. Further, it uses text analytics to include on the data set key data elements from unstructured data sources such as nursing notes. The technology then applies sophisticated statistical modeling techniques to derive insights from this newly complied normalized data set. Put together, this capability delivers previously difficult to discern insights about likely patient paths and outcomes, ensuring delivery of appropriate care to the right patient in a timely manner. It also ensures efficient use of scarce caregiver resources in making appropriate clinical decisions and providing care. 360Fresh has been rolled out in several complex and demanding institutions, including Scripps Health and Sutter Health and they all say that 360Fresh provides the right resolution to drive insight from their data. Its powerful capabilities are a strong match with our current technology programs and extend our work with our 1,300 technology members, including the hundreds of hospitals utilizing our Crimson platform. We believe that ultimately this work will transform the way care is delivered and dramatically enhance the quality of outcomes and efficiency of delivery. We're excited about the new capabilities and are very pleased to welcome the 360Fresh team to the firm. With that, let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail and to provide our guidance for calendar year 2013. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer : Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around 6 categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value, details in the acquisition of 360fresh and, finally, our outlook for the calendar 2013. First, the income statement. A quick reminder about our March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. Please also note that all prior period earnings per share numbers have been adjusted to reflect our 2-for-1 stock split that was effective on June 18. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 18.1% to $116.2 million, up from $98.5 million in the same period the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending December 31, 2012, was $19.3 million, up from $18.9 million in the same period the prior year. Adjusted net income was $10.2 million compared to $10.5 million last year and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.28 compared to $0.30 last year. The adjusted numbers for the quarter ending December 31, 2012 and 2011, exclude transaction- related costs and amortization, gains and losses on investment in common stock warrants, equity loss of unconsolidated entity, as well as share-based compensation expense. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted and non-GAAP results can be found on our press release. Including transaction-related cost amortization, gains and loss on an investment in common stock warrants, equity and income and consolidated entity, and share-based compensation expense, GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the quarter ending December 31, 2012 were $4.4 million and $0.12, respectively. Cost of services, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased to $63.1 million or 54.3% of revenue in the quarter ending December 31, 2012, compared to $51.5 million or 52.3% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. Increases in cost of services are due to increased expense for new and growing programs, including 2 new program launches this quarter, as well as $1.2 million in expenses from our acquisitions of ActiveStrategy and 360fresh during the quarter. Also included in cost of services for the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, was $900,000 of fair value adjustment to our various acquisition earn-out liabilities. During the same period the prior year, we recognized a gain of $200,000 from fair value adjustments. Member relations and marketing expense were $21.8 million or 18.8% of revenue in the quarter ending December 31, 2012, compared to $18.4 million or 18.7% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year. We currently have 175 sales teams in place, up 20% from 146 sales teams in place this quarter ending December 31, 2011. G&A expense increased to $16.6 million of 14.3% of revenue in the quarter ending December 31, 2012, compared to $12.4 million or 12.6% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year due primarily to an increase in personnel cost and infrastructure investment in our IT, HR, legal and finance functions to support our growing employee base, as well as approximately $250,000 of nonrecurring external cost related to our acquisition of 360fresh. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $5.2 million to 4.5% of revenue compared to $3.7 million or 3.7% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year due to increased amortization of capital investments in our growing technology platforms, the ActiveStrategy and 360Fresh acquisitions in the quarter, as well as additional depreciation from leasehold improvements relating to expansion space in our Austin, Texas and Washington, D.C. offices. Other income net in the quarter was $738,000 compared to $1.6 million the same period of the prior year. This quarter's other income consists of interest income of $940,000, a loss of $63,000, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our international members and $139,000 of fees relating to our credit facility. During the quarter ending December 31, 2011, we didn't just [ph] come up $597,000, a loss of $72,000 for changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and a $1.1 million fair value gain on our investments in common stock warrants. Moving on to our fiscal year to date income statement results. For the 9 months ending December 31, 2012, revenue increased 22.7% to $331 million, up from $269.9 million last year. GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share to the 9 months ending December 31, 2012, were $15.8 million and $0.44, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $60.2 million, $32.7 million and $0.91, respectively, for the 9 months ending December 31, 2012, compared to $50 million, $28.3 million and $0.83, respectively, for the same period the previous year. For the full calendar 2012, revenue was $431.6 million, an increase of 25% over the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $80 million, an increase of 30% over the prior year. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.21 compared to $1.04 last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased to $367.9 million as of December 31, 2012, compared to $267 million as of December 31, 2011. Excluding the effect of progress payments, DSOs on bill they are [ph] for 55 days as of December 31, 2012, compared to 50 days as of December 31, 2011, and 53 days as of December 31, 2012. Total deferred revenue net of amounts that we billed after 12 months increased to $508.9 million as of December 31, 2012, up from $371.9 million as of December 31, 2011. Excluding long-term deferred, the current portion of deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2012, was $396 million, up 30% over the prior year. Within [ph] cash flow, during the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, our cash generated from operating activities were $31.1 million compared to $30.2 million in the same quarter last year. After 9 months ending December 31, 2012, cash flow generated from operations was $73.1 million, up from $67.2 million in the prior fiscal year. Cash flow generated from operations in the 9 months ending December 31, 2012, includes $3 million of acquisition-related earn-out payments of which there are no [indiscernible] payments classified as cash flow used in operations for the same period last, the prior year. For calendar year 2012, we generated cash flow from operations of $98.8 million or 2.3x adjusted net income compared to $84 million or 2.3x adjusted net income per calendar 2011. Capital expenditures for the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, were approximately $11.6 million compared to $9.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. For the 3 months ended December 31, 2012, we repurchased $5 million of stock for approximately 110,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $336 million or 15.5 million shares. As of December 31, 2012, the remaining authorized share repurchase in that was $14 [ph] million. As of December 31, 2012, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $216.5 million representing approximately $5.95 per diluted share. At the contract value, contract value increased 18.2% to $450 million as of December 31, 2012, up from $380.7 million as of December 30, 2011. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. For contracts of more than 12 months duration. We include only 12 months in contract value. Turning to 360fresh. The company has also announced that we had purchased 360fresh, Inc., a leading provider of clinical data and analytics. The purchase price is approximately $17 million with additional potential consideration to be paid if certain business performance conditions are met across 21 months. We expect the 360Fresh acquisition to contribute minimal incremental revenue in calendar '13 and expect EBITDA dilution in the range of $3 million to $4 million. With respect to the outlook for calendar 2013, the following comments are intended to fall under the safe harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call, and are based on preliminary assumptions which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2013, we expect revenue to be in the range of approximately $495 million to $505 million, adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $90 million to $95 million, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of approximately $1.18 to $1.28. For calendar 2013, we expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $17.5 million and expect amortization from acquisition related intangibles to be approximately $7 million. We expect our effective tax rate for calendar '13 to be in the range of approximately 38% to 39%. This guidance includes the dilutive effects of the acquisition of ActiveStrategy and 360Fresh for approximately $6 million to $8 million combined in adjusted EBITDA and $0.11 to $0.16 in non-GAAP EPS. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO : Thanks, Michael. I'd like to conclude with a few comments about the year ahead and then we'll take any questions you have. We're gratified that the outstanding value we deliver to our members has driven continued momentum and we're very excited about opportunities ahead of us in 2013 and beyond. In order to capitalize on those opportunities, it is essential that we make smart investments, execute at a high standard across the year and continue to deliver world-class programs that drive significant returns for our members. Therefore, we will continue to our work this year with a sustained focus in 4 key areas. First, ensure outstanding member value. We continue to find new ways to enhance the research, software, service and impact we provide to members of all of our programs. This paves the way for the relationship, stewardship and cultivation so key to our success. With the enormously complex challenges facing health care and higher education, our members needed support at every level. And last year, nearly 4,000 institutions turned to us as the preeminent solution provider for their up-at-night issues. This was reflected in stellar QA feedback, meeting scores and member comments across 2012, such as this from a Chief Medical Officer: ""It is impossible for me to do my job without you."" I can imagine no higher praise for our work and ensuring that we continue to get these kinds of member reactions to our value remains a top priority in 2013. Second, continue relentless focus on growth. Today's market complexity and change continue to provide unprecedented opportunities to develop novel means of supporting our members. We're focused on operating with a clear vision of future market and member needs based on our extensive knowledge base and relationships across the industry and rapidly taking advantage of opportunities with new product launches and extensions, both organic and acquired. We're engaging the firm broadly in these efforts and I'm confident that new product Development will continue to be a key driver of our growth. Third, continue to evolve our go-to-market model. Over the past couple of years, we have worked to enhance the market-facing aspects of our firm including branding, messaging and commercial organization. This work is proven incredibly impactful and as we enter 2013, we are focused on continuing this work to migrate to even deeper and more powerful commercial relationships across our portfolio. In addition to continuing to refine our strategic marketing and leverage technology to enhance relationship efforts, this year, we're undertaking some new initiatives to further align our internal sales and account management organizations to serve members more effectively. These are off to a great start and then we'll ensure that we are well-positioned to drive member value and enhance our relationships going forward. Finally, we are constantly focused on attracting, cultivating, engaging and retaining world-class talent. Our success in this area was on full display in October. We met as a firm to vote on the finalist in our innovation challenge. I had issued the challenge at the start of 2012, calling for the infusion of new and creative approaches into every aspect of the business. The result was a phenomenal process with staff at all levels and in all divisions of the firm surfacing and launching creative solutions and innovations that range from sophisticated technologies to truly world-class member service enhancement. The challenge served as a fantastic showcase of our talent, a tremendously engaged, creative and dedicated group. There's no doubt that they are our greatest asset and will continue to be critical to our ability to have impact for members in the broader industry. Thank you for participating in tonight's call, and we will now open up the line for your questions."

At this time, I will turn the call over to the company’s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Robert Musslewhite. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thank you, and good evening. I’m Robert Musslewhite, Chief Executive Officer of The Advisory Board Company, and I’m joined this evening by Michael Kirshbaum, our Chief Financial Officer. We have a 3-part agenda for today's call: first, I will open with a summary of our performance for the quarter and for our fiscal year covering our financial results and the drivers of our business performance; I will then turn it over to Michael to take us through a more detailed review of the financials; and finally, I will close with an update on our key priorities for the remainder of the calendar year. As always, we'll be happy to take questions at the end of the call. Let me start with an overview of our financial results. Revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, increased 19% to $119.7 million from $100.5 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. For the quarter ended March 31, 2013, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $0.33 per diluted share and $22.7 million, respectively, compared with $0.31 per diluted share and $19.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, revenue increased 22% to $450.8 million from $370.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2012. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA were $1.23 per diluted share and $83.0 million, respectively, compared with $1.13 per diluted share and $70.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2012. We closed the quarter and the fiscal year with strong performance, with 19% revenue growth for the quarter and 17% contract value growth over last year at this time to a March 31, 2013, contract value of $466.3 million. Our membership base grew 10% to 4,114 institutions as of the close of the fiscal year, yielding an average contract value per member of approximately $113,000, up from approximately $107,000 last year. We also closed the fiscal year with an overall member renewal rate of 90%. This important fiscal year-end metric reflects both product quality and member satisfaction and is a critical factor in establishing our platform for future growth. Our consistently high member renewal rate provides visibility and predictability in the business. Looking at our strong performance across all of the key metrics that gauge the health of the business, revenue growth, contract value growth, membership base expansion and renewal rate, it is clear that our business model remains strong and that our members derive measurable impact from their work with us. In turn, this tangible value means that members want to continue to work with us in deeper and more comprehensive partnerships, driving ongoing company growth and expansion of our footprint and impact. One factor driving a deep and ongoing need for our products and services is the continued complexity in the markets we serve. Both hospitals and universities are facing the challenges posed by demographic shifts, revenue pressure, a new value orientation and business model transformations. These challenges mean that members need our help more than ever as they seek to both operate in the current environment and prepare for the big changes to come. One of our constituents feeling the complexity particularly intensely right now is the hospital and health system CFO. The big market changes in health care acutely impact this role. New reimbursement methodologies, such as value-based purchasing and bundled payments, require new financial and operational strategies. As hospitals seek to build a network to deliver more integrated care, financial relationships with physicians and other care providers change. As the population ages and a greater proportion of patients are covered by Medicare, CFOs must find a way to drive sustainable margins, a task made all the harder as reimbursements from government and commercial payers alike are becoming tighter overall. Our research distilled the many competing priorities for CFOs down to 3 key imperatives: excelling at risk-based contracting, expanding operating margins and maximizing revenue capture. We have a range of research, tools, performance technologies and services to help CFO manage the institution toward these imperatives, and I thought it might be helpful to share a few examples. First, excelling at risk- based contracting. As market forces shift from volume-based reimbursement structures to value-based incentives, hospitals and health systems will increasingly need to take on risk. In addition to the significant implications from a care delivery perspective, this shift also has financial implications. And through our Research and Insights programs, we offer numerous resources to help CFOs navigate this change. For example, our population health playbook for avoidable costs has been tremendously popular. Facing the growing prospect of managing risk-based contracts, health care leaders must develop effective strategies for managing the total cost of care for particular populations. Further complicating this challenge is the fact that most organizations have mixed risk portfolios and lack clear reimbursement incentives to guide their care transformation priorities. Our playbook offers avoidable cost benchmarks that provide insight into important spending differences by payer, health care service and diagnosis. These data allow CFOs to assess health system capabilities and economic realities to shape a strategy for thriving under evolving accountability incentives. Another tool that our Research and Insights team developed for CFOs is our value-based purchasing impact assessment. The tool provides CFOs with a facility-specific estimate of incentive payments that the facility would receive under Medicare's hospital inpatient value-based purchasing program. It also ranks the incentive payment relative to other facilities to allow CFOs to benchmark their performance. Finally, the tool helps identify underlying quality measures driving suboptimal performance to provide CFOs a blueprint for working with their teams to take the steps required to improve. This tool has been extremely popular with more than 700 institutions using it to prepare for new reimbursement models. Of course, it is not just government payers moving towards risk-based contracting, and our CFOs have also been very interested in our commercial bundled payment tracker. Across the country, dozens of providers have already inked bundled payment contracts with commercial insurers and employers, and CFOs are hungry for information about those institutions that have already taken this step. Our tool provides a comprehensive, one-stop shop for information about these types of contracts with descriptions of these private payer and direct-to-employer bundling initiatives. More than just a compilation, the tool allows CFOs to filter the contacts by service line to see where bundled contracts are getting the most traction and to learn more about the service lines most important to their own bundled payment strategies. We are constantly updating this tool as news of new bundled contracts surfaces. With more than 4,000 users of the tool, it is clear that in a market that is this dynamic, having a single, reliable, usable source for this information is invaluable to our members. On the second imperative of expanding operating margins, our CFOs take advantage of our wide array of performance technologies aimed at cost reduction. From our nursing operations performance program, which helped an academic medical center in the Midwest improve productivity and reduce premium labor for $5 million in annualized savings, to our surgery performance program which helped a 2- hospital system in the South reduce surgery supply costs by over $500,000 through standardization and manufacturer rebates. These memberships help CFOs work across the organization to inflect performance in areas beyond their finance scope and are a great complement to our Medicare breakeven initiative, which I spoke about in depth in our November 2012 call. Because finance must continually engage department and service line leaders and clinicians to jointly drive margin management initiatives, our research program for CFOs recently released a resource called The Financially Accountable Health System. This research provides strategies for equipping staff with the knowledge and tools necessary to control costs and coaches CFOs on how to effectively provide physicians with actionable data that contributes directly to care redesign. With a special focus on using lean techniques to drive waste out of operational and clinical activities, the research helps CFOs with the difficult task of embedding financial discipline in the line. As hospitals increasingly purchase physician practices to prepare for new care and reimbursement models, the economics of owned physician practices are another place that CFOs must focus their margin efforts. Many hospitals experience significant losses in their physician practices. A variety of factors, including a lack of shared governments, misaligned incentives, inadequate IT infrastructure and subpar physician leadership can contribute, and it is often hard for CFOs to diagnose the issues and inflect performance. To meet these needs, we provide unparalleled practice management and consulting services through our Southwind division to improve, in fact, in many cases turn around, practice economics. Southwind takes a multidisciplinary approach to these problems with our team of foremost experts on professional fee revenue cycle, information technology, coding and compliance, physician compensation, financial reporting and patient and provider satisfaction. Engagements range from assessments to interim and long-term management, and the results are consistently outstanding. For example, we've been working over the last 3 years to turn around a hospital-owned, 130-provider, multi-specialty group practice. Our team led a focused improvement effort that included professional fee revenue cycle redesign, IT optimization, physician compensation redesign and governance and management restructuring. Through this work, there was a $5.5 million improvement in practice economics in the first year alone, with nearly $20 million of improvement across the 3-year engagement. What we are seeing is that the physician practice economics improvement opportunities are so sizable that we can engage in earnest and still provide significant returns to members. 3:1 ROI for our members is typical and it is often more. Our work in this area is particularly critical given today's market dynamics, and we are proud to offer this outstanding set of services. On the third imperative of maximizing revenue capture, I wanted to first share a story from our payer integrity performance program. One member, a 3-hospital system in the Southeast, lacked the internal processes and personnel to undertake the time-intensive task of identifying underpayments and correcting them through communication with payers. Through participation in our payer integrity performance program, the system's managed care office and central business office were able to work together to identify payment discrepancies in a Medicaid and Medicare HMO contract and follow-up with the payer to collect the additional amount due. They collected $4.7 million in underpayments from that one contract alone. Further, they are using our program to both monitor payer performance and negotiate contract terms on an ongoing basis. Of course, no discussion of maximizing revenue capture would be complete today without a discussion of the impending transition to ICD-10 coding. On October 1, 2014, the entire system for coding, reporting and billing medical diagnoses and inpatient procedures will change from the current system, ICD-9, to the new, radically more complex ICD-10 code sets. Required for everyone covered by HIPAA, so essentially all providers of inpatient medical care, this is a daunting prospect. ICD-10 has the potential to substantially impact revenue of hospitals than don't prepare effectively. Our analysis indicates that for a 400-bed hospital, the gap between minimal preparation and top performance can run up to $15 million. Key to strong performance is educating physicians on increased documentation requirements and also appropriately mapping diagnoses to the new DRGs, which function as billing codes. To help members successfully plan for and navigate this transition, we offer our CFOs a variety of technology, tools and services. First, our research program for CFOs has built an in-depth ICD-10 readiness diagnostic. This web-based tool helps members evaluate their organization's degree of preparation for the ICD-10 transition across 6 areas: general organization, information technology, coding and clinical documentation improvement, physician education and awareness, revenue cycle and managed-care contracts. The tool provides graphical summaries highlighting the strengths and improvement opportunities in specific areas of ICD-10 preparation, as well as guidance for the preparation areas determined to be opportunities for improvement. In addition, for those institutions needing more support in this area, our revenue cycle consulting group has developed ICD-10 consulting engagements that cover a wide range of areas critical for the transition, including clinical documentation improvement process redesign, assistance with systems implementation, EMR template building and full scale on-site project management support. Our work here is having a very tangible impact. One member said of our services, ""The Advisory Board has really helped us look at our resources and figure out how to stage the work and how to get the best out of the people we have, but also how to be as efficient and effective as possible. The Advisory Board helped us plan in place and figure out where to start and then to know where we're going as well."" I'm also pleased to announce today the launch of our ICD-10 Performance Program. Through our partnership with MedeAnalytics, the program provides members a software tool that uses hospital's individual patient accounting and claims data and a proprietary risk algorithm to provide a comprehensive picture of the ICD-10 inflection points for an individual hospital. This helps identify by code, physician and service line the areas of focus for education and process change. The tool is complemented by an extensive best practice library, which provides step-by-step instructions on training physicians and coders on the new documentation concepts and dashboards to monitor ongoing performance. The program enables members to prioritize their ICD-10 preparations and provides analytics and best practices to drive a wide range of training efforts and process improvements across the hospital. With its robust analytical backbone, the program is supporting members in their efforts to prepare for this massive change in the coding and billing of care provided in hospitals. Early into our work on this program, we are already generating tangible results. One alpha development partner leveraged our resources to identify critical diagnoses where there was opportunity to improve physician documentation and then used our best practices to improve education efforts, garnering improvements of over $50,000 in the first month alone. With encouraging results such as these, the initiative is off to a strong start, and we are confident in the value that it will provide to members. The ICD-10 transition is an enormous undertaking, and it is gratifying to be able to offer members support in this critical area. With that, let me now turn things over to Michael to review our financials in more detail. Michael T. Kirshbaum Former CFO & Treasurer Thanks, Robert. I've organized today's financial review around 5 categories: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow, contract value and outlook for calendar year 2013. First, the income statement. A quick reminder that we're on a March 31 fiscal year end, which means we just finished the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. Please also note that all prior period's earnings per share numbers have been adjusted to reflect our 2:1 stock split that was effective on June 18, 2012. For the quarter just ended, our revenue increased 19.1% to $119.7 million, up from $105 million in the same period the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ending March 31, 2013, was $22.7 million, up from $19.8 million in the same period of the prior year. Adjusted net income was $12.2 million compared to $11.1 million last year, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.33 compared to $0.31 last year. These adjusted numbers for the quarters ended March 31, 2013 and '12 exclude transaction-related cost and amortization, gains and losses on the investment income and stock warrants, equity loss of unconsolidated entity, gain on sale and operations -- discontinued operations, as well as share-based compensation expense. Reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results can be found in our press release. Including these transaction-related costs and amortization, gains and losses on investment in common stock warrants, equity and income of unconsolidated entities, the gain on sale of operations -- discontinued operations and share-based compensation expense, GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, were $6.4 million and $0.18, respectively. Cost of services, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased to $61.6 million or 51.4% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, compared to $53.7 million or 53.4% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. The increases in cost of services are due to increased expense for new and growing programs inclusive of our acquisitions of ActiveStrategy and 360Fresh during the prior quarter. Member relations and marketing expense was $22.8 million or 19.1% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, compared to $19.1 million or 19% of revenue for the same period of the prior year. We currently have 182 sales teams in place, up 17% from 155 sales teams in place in the quarter ended March 31, 2012. G&A expense increased to $16.5 million or 13.8% of revenue in the quarter ended March 31, 2013, compared to $12.8 million or 12.7% of revenue in the same quarter the prior year due primarily to an increase in personnel cost and infrastructure investment in our IT, legal and finance functions to support our growing employee base, as well as increased investment in our new product development group. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $6.1 million or 5.1% of revenue compared to $4 million or 4% of revenue in the same quarter of the prior year. This increase is due to capital investments in our growing technology programs, the ActiveStrategy and 360Fresh acquisitions last quarter, as well as additional depreciation from leasehold improvements relating to expansion space in our Austin, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. offices. Other income net in the quarter was $602,000 compared to $164,000 in the same quarter the prior year. This quarter's other income consists of interest income of $782,000 and a loss of $251,000 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our receivables from international members, as well as $139,000 of fees relating to our credit facility and a $210,000 fair gain on our investment in common stock warrants. During the quarter ended March 31, 2012, we had interest income of $698,000, a gain of $116,000 for changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a $650,000 fair value loss on our investment in common stock warrants. Now moving on to our fiscal year income statement results. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, revenue increased 21.7% to $450.8 million, up from $370.3 million last year. GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share for the fiscal year ending March 31 were $22.2 million and $0.61, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted income and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $83 million, $44.8 million and $1.23, respectively, for fiscal year 2013 compared to $70.3 million, $39.4 million and $1.13, respectively, for fiscal year 2012. Now turning to the balance sheet. Our membership fees receivable, which excludes long-term receivables, increased to $351.6 million as of March 31, 2013, compared to $281.6 million as of March 31, 2012. Excluding the effects of progress payments, DSOs unbilled AR 59 days as of March 31, 2013, compared to 56 days as of March 31, 2012. Total deferred revenue, net of amounts that we billed up to 12 months, increased to $484.3 million as of March 31, 2013, up from $392.5 million as of March 31, 2012. Excluding long-term deferred, the current portion of deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2013, were $386.7 million, up 23% over the prior year. Looking at cash flow, during the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, our cash generated from operating activity was $7.9 million compared to $25.7 million in the same quarter last year. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, cash flow generated from operations was $81.1 million compared to $92.7 million in the same -- in the prior fiscal year. The decrease in cash flows from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, is primarily timing related as we finished the fiscal year with cash flow from operations of 1.8x adjusted net income, which is within our historical range of 1.5x to 2x. Capital expenditures for 3 months ending March 31, 2013, were approximately $11 million compared to $7.4 million for the 3 months ended March 31, 2012. For the 3 months ended March 31, 2013, we repurchased $5 million of stock or approximately 98,000 shares. This brings our total share repurchase since the inception of the program in 2004 to $341 million or 15.6 million shares. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and our Board of Directors has recently authorized an additional $100 million of the share repurchase plan bringing the remaining authorized share repurchase amount to $109 million. As of March 31, 2013, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances were approximately $214.7 million, representing approximately $5.88 per diluted share. At the contract value, contract value increased 17.1% to $466.3 million as of March 31, 2013, up from $398.3 million as of March 31, 2012. We define contract value as the aggregate annualized revenue attributable to all agreements in effect at any given point in time without regard to the initial term or remaining duration of any such agreements. The contracts of more than 12-month duration, we include only 12 months of contract value. With respect to the outlook for the remainder of calendar year 2013, the following comments are intended to fall under the Safe Harbor provisions outlined at the beginning of the call and are based on preliminary assumptions, which are subject to change over time. For calendar 2013, we continue to expect revenue to be in the range of approximately $495 million to $505 million, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of approximately $90 million to $95 million and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of approximately $1.18 to $1.28. For calendar '13 -- 2013, we continue to expect share-based compensation expense to be approximately $17.5 million and expect amortization from acquisition-related intangibles to be approximately $7 million. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 to be in the range of approximately 38% to 39%. As a reminder, this guidance includes the dilutive effects of the previously announced acquisitions of ActiveStrategy and 360Fresh of approximately $6 million to $8 million in adjusted EBITDA and $0.11 to $0.16 in non-GAAP EPS. This concludes the financial summary. I'll now turn things back over to Robert. Robert W. Musslewhite Former Chairman & CEO Thanks, Michael. I would like to conclude with a few comments about our priorities for the year and then we will take any questions you have. As I mentioned in our last call, we have 4 key priorities this year to ensure that we are making smart investments, executing at a high standard and continuing to deliver world-class programs that drive significant returns for our members. Our focus in these areas is especially important right now in the second calendar quarter because each year we expect to do a high volume of business during, and especially at the end of, this quarter. And strong performance this quarter is important in setting up of our financial performance for the remainder of the calendar year. These areas of focus include, first, ensuring outstanding member value. We continue to find new ways to enhance the research, software, service and impact we provide to members of all of our programs. One recent example that you may have read about is the work we are doing with the state of Rhode Island. We are tremendously excited to be helping Rhode Island develop a new state-based, multi-payer health care delivery and payment system transformation model as part of a $300 million national effort by CMS. While still very early, this healthy Rhode Island project puts The Advisory Board at the forefront of care transformation at the state level and opens up opportunity for us to have an even greater impact on health care across the country. This and our many other relationships show that, with the enormously complex challenges facing health care and higher education, our members needed support at every level. And last year, over 4,100 institutions turned to us as the preeminent solution provider for their up at night issues. Second, continuing a relentless focus on growth. With our clear vision of future market and member needs based on our extensive knowledge base and relationships across the industry, we continue to rapidly come to market with the right products at the right time in order to continue our growth formula. In addition to organic growth through cross-selling and internal new program development, we have a track record of strong acquisitions that bolster key capabilities and add value. Our 2 most recent acquisitions are both good examples of this. Most recently, our acquisition of 360Fresh provides capabilities that will prove increasingly critical as value-based payment structures drive a need for dynamic clinical intelligence that predicts the future impact of today's care decisions. While it is still early days here, we are excited about the ways in which this new technology will help us expand our Crimson work in a new direction. Our acquisition of ActiveStrategy late last year provides a new platform to impact the patient experience through the combination of mobile collection of behavioral and observational data with real-time, point- of-care service recovery capabilities. The first program launched off this platform, the patient experience program, is seeing strong attachment in the market and we continue to be excited about both the near- term opportunity and also about the broader opportunity this platform affords us in the quality, operations and patient experience space. Third, continuing to evolve our go-to-market model. This year, we are focused on migrating to even deeper and more powerful commercial relationships across our portfolio, and we have undertaken some new initiatives to further align our internal sales and account management organizations to serve members more effectively. Although these initiatives require some short-term operational and member service transitions, we are very confident that these investments will be impactful in ensuring that we are both providing gold standard service and maximizing our ability to deepen and expand member relationships. Finally, we're constantly focused on attracting, cultivating, engaging and retaining world-class talent. Talent is our most important asset and it's always a top priority of mine and of the entire executive team. We have a truly outstanding workforce and I was pleased to see an email recently that shows how well regarded our team is from outside the company, as well as within. A VP of Finance from a 4-hospital system in the South wrote the following, ""If I haven't mentioned this lately, please know I think you have an absolutely fantastic team. It is a true pleasure working with so many talented and wonderful people. You must have one of the best human resource departments in the country because you seem to hire only the very best. It gives me hope for the future of health care when I see so many talented people leading the way."" Tremendous praise indeed and earned each and every day through the hard work of our exceptional 2,400 employees working in our 9 offices around the globe. On that note, we are proud that The Advisory Board Company once again was named as one of Modern Healthcare's Best Places to Work, reaffirming our position as a fantastic destination for top talent. Thank you for participating in tonight's call, and we will now open up the line for your questions."
191,GV_001449_2011Q4,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Aflac Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of our U.S. Operations; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, First Senior Vice President Global Chief Investment Officer; Toru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan who is joining us from Tokyo. Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in the teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at quarterly release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. Now, I'm going to turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in both Japan and the U.S. Dan? Daniel Paul Amos Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased that we met and, in many cases, significantly exceeded our financial and operational performance for the fourth quarter and the year. I'll briefly review the quarter and the year starting with the operations in Japan and the U.S. Let me begin with Aflac Japan, our largest earning contributor, that generated strong results throughout 2011. We were again pleased with Aflac Japan's financial performance, and particularly the tremendous sales momentum they produced. New annualized premium sales rose 31% to JPY 48.6 billion for the quarter which significantly exceeded our expectations and set all-time quarterly record. Aflac Japan outstanding sales results are especially remarkable considering 2011 was the year Japan was hit by the most devastating natural disaster in its history. For the year, total new annualized premium sales rose 18.6%, though suppressed by the strong yen revenue growth in yen rose 6% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Pretax earnings rose 8% for the quarter and 6.8% for the year. Bank channel sales significantly exceeded our expectations, generating JPY 16.5 billion in new annualized premium sales produced and accounted for 33.9% of total Aflac Japan sales. This represents an increase of 135% over the fourth quarter of 2010. Banks have been very successful in selling products especially with WAYS, our unique hybrid whole life product. In the fourth quarter, the bank channel produced 323% increase in the sale of WAYS over the fourth quarter of 2010. Looking at the bank channel sales, we anticipate sales comparisons in 2012 will be especially difficult, especially in the second half of the year, following the record 2011 results. Keep in mind, we anticipated the momentum of WAYS sales through banks to carry over into the first quarter of 2012. In fact, we believe first quarter sales of Aflac products through banks will be up more than 150%. This is in large part because we expect an intense product first quarter push from banks to finish their fiscal year very strong. Following in a strong first quarter, we anticipate the decline in the second half of the year. One reason is the phenomenal sales growth resulting from the addition of new banks has been mostly tapped. You'll recall that we started in the smaller Shinkin banks, then the regional banks and now all for the mega banks. Following a great start to the year is Japan banks focus on strong sales for the conclusion of their fiscal year, sales will be increasingly challenged when going up against record third and fourth quarter results. Keep in mind that we've been selling WAYS, our top-selling product, through banks for as long as 2 years at some banks. That means we've already cycled through the first major pass at selling this product to the large portion of the bank customers, though we believe sales through bank channels will be down for the full year. With respect to Aflac Japan's traditional sales channel, the tremendous sales results in 2009 and 2010 from our EVER product in the Maneki Neko duck campaign created tough comparisons in 2011. Our traditional sales channel produced flat in 2011, but I expect to see sales growth from this channel in 2012. Before I turn to the U.S., I want to give you some perspective on our Japan business. Until recently, 2010 was by far the best year we have ever had in Aflac Japan sales. As we entered 2011, it was absolutely unthinkable that Aflac Japan could generate an 18.6% sales increase for the year. That's exactly what we did, and we crushed 2010 sales records by JPY 25.5 billion or $316 million. Following that kind of sales growth, I can't imagine that any of you would be surprised that we expect Aflac Japan sales to be down 2% to 5% for 2012. You'll recall my comments in the third quarter, I'm not about to hold business in order to smooth the sales track for the future. It is in the best interest of our shareholders to take sales when they come in, and that's exactly what we did and had a 31% increase in the fourth quarter. Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. It's been and continues to be an outstanding -- a long-standing vision to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance in the United States, a position we've held for many years. Aflac U.S. generated 9.3% increase in new annualized premium sales for the quarter and a 6.8% increase for the year. We are pleased with those strong results which exceeded our annual sales expectations of flat to up 5%. I would also note that in 2011, we had stronger persistency than we have had in over a dozen years. We are continually leveraging Aflac strong brand by directing our efforts and initiatives to support that. Part of what has driven Aflac's success is our commitment to investing in our business infrastructure. Once we achieve our corporate earnings objective, we look for opportunities to strengthen our business operations. We told you that we were going to increase expenses in the fourth quarter on IT and marketing initiatives, following 3 quarters of restrained spending and that's exactly what we did. These higher expenditures substantially contributed to fourth quarter earnings decrease of 11.8%. Earnings for 2011 were basically flat which is better than expected for the year. This is because 2010's earnings benefited from the release of a $40-million reserve from a 2009 lapsation of a large account. Revenues rose 4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. We continue to expand Aflac's potential to connect with employees at many companies, large and small, across the United States. 2009 addition of group products to our existing portfolio has allowed us to leverage our strong brand and provide more options for customers in both traditional and broker distribution channels. In 2011, product marketing efforts geared toward existing accounts contributed to strong sales for the veteran agents. Those efforts included strategic product pushes of enhanced products including dental and short-term disability. Additionally, you'll recall that we've been establishing and developing relationships with brokers that handle larger cases. While the broker initiatives still is in the infancy, we are excited about the opportunity this channel presents for future growth. I believe that given the challenging economic environment, our success in achieving a sales increase of 6.8% for the full year is outstanding. The U.S. continues to provide a vast and accessible market for our products by leveraging our strong brand and enhancing our portfolio of individual and group voluntary products. We expanded our universe of potential customers within the vast and accessible market. For 2012, we expect Aflac Japan sales to increase in the range of 3% to 8%. With both operating segments performing well, investments are my top priority as a CEO. The financial crisis that began at the end of 2008 transformed the investment landscape. In the wake of the fallout, we've been closely evaluating our investment function. In addition to our proactive derisking activities, over the past several years, we've also enhanced our global investment platform by investing in systems that will help us refine our analysis. By management -- my management philosophy has always been to find the right person for the job then give them the latitude and support them to deliver the results. As most of you know, Eric Kirsch officially joined Aflac as the Global Chief Investment Officer on November 1. I'm confident he is the right person to prove the capabilities of our investment function. Eric's 3 decades of experience in building and leading global teams and managing assets will help us further our vision to be a world-class investment organization that pays particular attention to the needs of the insurance operations through effective ALM and capital adequacy management while also balancing the expectations of shareholders through the investment income growth. It goes without saying that this objective is in the best interest of the policyholders. We didn't bring Eric on board to manage our global investments from a status quo standpoint. Given continued challenges in today's environment, we are calling upon Eric's global perspective to evaluate where we are with the investments in relation to the current financial backdrop, and where we want to be within that same space. Eric's on the call today, so he will answer your questions when we go to Q&A. But first, let me highlight some of the actions we took with investments this quarter. As conditions in Europe has deteriorated further, volatility has increased. And we are not presently making any new investments in Europe. As part of the company's strategy to improve our investment credit profile and diversification, we decreased our exposure to Europe through optimistic investment transactions and impairments. I want to emphasize that these impairment charges are as a whole, different from the impairments we've taken in the past. These impairments did not result from a significant credit changes to specific companies. Instead, they reflected a well-thought-out strategy to reduce our overall exposure to Europe. I would remind you that our strong capital position and our operation to generate significant capital on an annual basis, we were able to make impairments from a position of strength. We were able to offset a portion of the losses with the sale of the holding of the U.S. Treasury strips, which produced an after-tax gain of $218 million. So our net after-tax losses for the first quarter was $145 million, which was down from $191 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. We will continue to look for opportunities to lower our holdings of European financial assets. Let me remind you of how successful we've been in substantially enhancing our investment portfolio over the past few years. From January of 2008 to the end of 2011, we have dramatically cut our holdings of sovereign and financial investments in PIIGS countries from 5.9 to 2.2 of the total investments in cash. For example, on the fourth quarter, we exercised the downgrade put on a local Spanish authority, La Mancha [ph], and put the security back to them at par. We've also lowered our investment in perpetual securities by more than half, going from 14.7 to 6.8 of the total investments in cash. We sold the perpetual security in the fourth quarter KBL at a much higher sales price than an impaired value. DBN Nor [ph] also redeemed the perpetual upper Tier 2 security in December. I'd also like to point out that none of the perpetual securities we currently own are in PIIGS countries. As we pursue opportunistic investment transactions, we will continue to take actions to reduce our exposure to European debt. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated financial performance. Operating per diluted share rose 11.3% to $1.48 for the quarter, and 15.5% or $6.33 for the full year. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen, operating per diluted share rose 6.8% for the quarter and 8% for the year, which was consistent with our 2011 EPS objectives of an 8% increase before the impact of the yen. I am pleased that for the 22nd year, we have achieved our operating earnings objective. I'd like to comment on the capital position. The strength of our capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders, bondholders, as well as our shareholders. As we've communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC, remains a priority for us. We have conveyed that our goal was to end 2011 with an RBC ratio in the range of 400 to 500, with a target of 450. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that 2011 RBC ratio will be between the 480 and 520. Our capital strength enables us to increase our cash dividend to shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2011 for the 29th consecutive year. Our objective is to grow our dividend at the rate in line with our earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. I believe dividends are an important component of the value that we provide investors. Additionally in the fourth quarter, we purchased 900,000 shares of Aflac's stock bringing the total number of shares purchased for the full year to 6 million. As we have said for many years, when it comes to the deploying capital for the benefit of shareholders, we still believe that repurchasing our shares and growing the cash dividend of the most attractive means and that is something that we will continue to pursue. As you've heard us say before, proper repatriation has always been the primary source of funding our share repurchase programs and that is true for 2012. We mentioned on the third quarter call, that we estimated 2012 profit repatriation to be about JPY 45 billion, assuming no additional material investment losses through March 31, 2012. However, since that time, we again enhanced the quality of the portfolio through reducing our exposure to European assets. These results incurred investment losses in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the reevaluation of the Aflac Japan's deferred tax assets resulted from the reduction of the corporate tax rate in Japan, will lower our current SSA-based earnings. Therefore, our profit repatriation in 2012 will be less than we originally anticipated. We will make a decision about the amount of money that we will transfer from Japan to the U.S. around middle of the year. In thinking of that decision, we will be taking into consideration the needs of all of our shareholders in Japan including the policyholders. As you know, our capital adequacy in Japan is principally measured by the solvency margin ratio which we estimate within the range of 520 to 560 at calendar year 2011. We are comfortable with this level of solvency margin ratio but continue to test our capital adequacy ratios by applying vigorous stress test under extreme scenarios. As we've discussed, one of the potential risk to the solvency margin is the rising interest rates. Although this does not seem likely in the short run, we continue to assess the impact of rising interest rates on solvency margin ratios. In that regard, we've taken action to help mitigate that risk. For instance, we sold a portion of our JGB holdings, classified as available for sale and then repurchased them the same amount of JGBs classifying them as held to maturity. Additionally, we sold the remainder of our holdings of U.S. Treasury strips in the fourth quarter, and reinvested the proceeds primarily in JGB that were classified as held to maturity. Looking ahead, I want to reiterate that our objective for 2012 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share, 2% to 5%, on a currency-neutral basis. This range reflects the impact of the portfolio derisking and investing significantly cash flows at lower interest rates. We expect the rate of earnings growth for 2013 to improve over 2012. I'm very pleased with how we have responded to the challenges in 2011 and remain focused on our vision to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance products in the United States, and the #1 provider of supplemental insurance in Japan. Robin, I'll turn it over to you. Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Thanks, Dan. Today, I'm going to dispense with our usual process of highlighting financial and operational metrics in order to allow more time for questions. However, to use this time most effectively, I would suggest you focus your questions on the how and why. If you have a question of fact, the odds are we disclosed it. If you can't find the answer, please call Investor Relations and Tom and I will be happy to help. But before we get to your Q&A, I'd like to highlight several things that came up repeatedly in the conversations last night. One relates to the profitability characteristics of our WAYS product in Japan. One, it has higher premium about 9x the premium of our medical and cancer products. Two, lower commission rates. Three, a higher benefit ratio. I'd like to add that our benefit ratio in Japan primarily reflected the increased sales of WAYS which greatly exceeded our expectations. As we've said before, the overall profitability of the sale of one WAYS policy is about the same as the sale of one of our cancer or medical products. My second comment relates to impairments in the quarter. Of the total impairments for the quarter, there was only one impairment, CSAV, related specifically to the credit of that company. The remainder were related to our investment strategy and the basket of securities we identified with the intent to sell that Eric will discuss later. As in the past, I would remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one associated follow-up in order to be fair to the other callers. But before we begin taking your questions, since this is Eric's first quarter with the company, I'd like Eric to comment on his objectives, strategies and challenges for the investment area. Once he completes his opening remarks, we'll open the lines to your call. Eric? Eric Mark Kirsch Executive VP, Global Chief Investment Officer & President of Aflac Global Investments Thank you, Robin. And let me start by thanking Dan and the management team for allowing me to become part of the Aflac family, a terrific and great organization, and asking me to take the challenge on bringing the Aflac investment group up to world-class standards. It's a terrific challenge, but it's also a great opportunity, and it's a great opportunity for our shareholders. Let me give you a sense of what I've been doing in my first 3 months on the ground, and in the spirit of becoming world-class, I would classify my objectives as both strategic in order to move us to world-class, as well as tactical, because we have investments to make and investments to analyze every single day as the world in particularly Europe in such a dynamic and volatile place, if you will. Firstly, I've spent significant time on the ground in our operations in Columbus worldwide headquarters with our investment teams and management. And I have spent significant time in Japan having made 3 trips already, spent significant time with our investment teams on the ground in Japan, as well as our senior management, which has allowed me to fully understand our capabilities, our challenges and our issues. I've also had the opportunity, right when I started, to meet with all members of the board and to work closely with our finance and investment committees. As you all probably are aware, we have many governance structures internally around the investment functions and I have taken over as chair, for example, of our global investment committee and our credit subcommittee, and we're working very closely with our finance and investment committee representing our investment goals [ph] this year. Let me break up my conversation in the next few minutes into the strategic and these tactical buckets. And let me start on the strategic front, and then move into the tactical front. Strategically, the charge is, let's make sure that Aflac is a world-class investment organization, by reviewing all of our capability, not only in human capital, but also with respect to technology, also with respect to investment process, also with respect to best in class investment strategies to ensure that our portfolio is well diversified, well- managed and we understand all the rest that we can take and take advantage of in consideration of our capital. So 2 things that we have engaged folks on that we are working on extensively already. First, we've hired McKinsey & Company, a well-known management consultant, to work alongside me to do a strategic review of our investment capabilities on a global basis. That project has already started. We have steering committees of senior management that have already met with McKinsey, and McKinsey has been on the ground in our Japan office as well as in our Columbus office and New York, already doing an extensive review. We expect this project to take about 3 months and to conclude somewhere at the end of March. Secondly, we have embarked on a strategic asset allocation, ALM capital management exercise. So specifically, what that means is we want to take a broad look at all the investment opportunities that are appropriate for an insurance company, appropriate for our company, of our locations in Japan and Columbus, appropriate for the type of liabilities that we have, and well-managed given the objectives that we have with respect to capital. That project we've embarked on with Goldman Sachs asset management, who is a world leader in this expertise, and what my expectation of that is to look at a broader set of asset classes and investment opportunities that we can use in the future that has not been used historically at Aflac which will help us improve the overall quality of the earnings of our portfolio and diversification for the future. That project will take approximately 5 months, and my expectation is, when we have those recommendations and work with the senior management and our board for approvals, we'll begin to implement those strategies somewhere in the second half of the year. So those are the strategic parts that go along with defining our roadmap which I think in the second half of the year will be very well defined and we'll be able to articulate that to you. Let me move to tactical because that's so, so important as we have $100-plus-billion balance sheet, that in fact is invested on a global basis in a time of great volatility in the markets. So with respect to that, I have spent significant time with our investment teams, both in Japan and the U.S., looking at all of our holdings, understanding where our exposures are, where our concentrations are. In addition, as you all know, we've made a commitment to do outsourcing. And I took advantage of asking some potential partners of the future to work with us, to look at our portfolio so that I can have a second set of eyes and opinions that complement our own. So with respect to that, as you all know, we do have concentrations in Europe. And as you also know, and I'm pleased to tell you that I reviewed, the company had been on a derisking strategy over the last few years and it made significant improvement in reducing those exposures and increasing the quality and lessening the volatility of our portfolio. Nevertheless, we still have those exposures, and as I look at that basket of securities with a focus on Europe, where most of my attention has been focused on, clearly, I'm focused on the financials. As I look at our broad portfolio, it's actually a high-quality portfolio. As you know, most of our assets are in private placement form where we've had the opportunity to negotiate specific covenants to our structures. But clearly, the financials represent the greatest challenge with respect to the situation in Europe. And let me remind everybody, that in the second half of this year, the volatility in Europe increased to unprecedented proportion that nobody could have imagined. And it's multifaceted because we've got the political framework, the monetary framework and the fiscal framework in a very difficult situation in Europe in order to get agreement. And during the quarter, no matter what financial indicator you look at with respect to European assets or European financials, in particular, the spread in the marketplace went to all-time highs in terms of volatility. During the quarter, as different actions were successful by the politicians and the monetary officials and some actions were not. In the last month of the year, we did see an easing up as the ECB has basically provided liquidity to financial institutions, helping to take the biggest risk, a Lehman type risk, off the table. Nevertheless, we will continue to see volatility in Europe in my opinion over the next couple of years, as they try to reach consensus on some strategies that will be everlasting in nature, but that will take some time. With that in mind, that expected volatility, as I looked at the portfolio, I felt it was necessary to have a strategy to continue to reduce these exposures, in particular, with the financials so that we can lessen our exposure to that potential volatility which is very, very hard to predict. As Dan and Robin have mentioned, consistent with that strategy, since we've embarked on that in late December, we took a number of impairments with respect to that basket of securities because our intent is now focused on executing those strategies which started in late December and are going to be ongoing throughout this year, but hopefully primarily completed before the midyear mark. So again to emphasize, those impairments were not because of credit related reasons with respect to the financials. They're related to a strategy that's focused on improving the quality of our portfolio, lessening the exposure to the financial sector, so that we'll have less volatility should the situation in Europe continue to be volatile, which I believe it will be. We will be highly vigilant on these holdings. Our teams are highly focused on it and where it makes sense, we will leverage outside advisers that are potentially going to become outsourcing partners with us so that we have the best intelligence in the world to make the best informed decisions. I should also may -- mention early on my arrival, upon my assessment, I put a stop to all new investments in Europe. As I look at our broad exposure, while I believe the quality of the portfolio is very high, with obviously the risk in the financial sectors I've already mentioned, I felt that our macro exposure to Europe was at its limits, and there was no need to make further investments, even though there are many good companies in Europe that we could find as attractive opportunities, we just have reached our risk bucket. Nevertheless, there are new investment opportunities we're looking at in other parts of the world. So with that, those are the strategic and the tactical things. We're working hard on all of those fronts. And we'll continue to provide you updates as the situation continues to develop. But we're very proud of the work that we've done to-date. And we feel good with respect to where our portfolio is and feel good that these strategies will transition us into the future state. Daniel Paul Amos Chairman, President & CEO Eric, why don't you go ahead and answer a couple of questions that came up last night that you overheard and give them a sense and then we'll take their questions. It might cut down the questions. Eric Mark Kirsch Executive VP, Global Chief Investment Officer & President of Aflac Global Investments Sure. Again, one of the questions we've heard last night was, can we see the list of specific securities and is that it? The reason we've not provided the list is, this is a strategy. The strategy around our financials. And as you all know, our investments are not publicly traded investments. They're in the form of private placements. And what that means is, these are privately negotiated transactions in order for us to find ways to either liquidate those securities that we'd like to reduce exposure to, and if we can't do that, there are other strategies such as looking at hedging strategies, credit default swaps and amongst the bucket of securities that we wish to look at, we will only execute if we get a value that we feel is optimal for our shareholders. We will not execute simply in the interest of trying to reduce the exposures if we can't get a fair value. So in that spirit, the negotiations will take a few months to develop, and we will report to you as we actually transact during our regular reporting periods, but I want to emphasize that it's a strategy. Another question that comes up is, do you expect more? That is a difficult question to answer. What I expect is the situation in Europe will continue to be volatile. Just -- let's look at the recent activity. The month of December started to feel better, financial indications -- indicators in Europe began to get better, because the ECB came to the table and is providing liquidity to the system. Just in the last 2 weeks, questions have arose again with respect to Greece. And again, I'm proud to say that we don't have any exposure to Greece. But nevertheless, because those questions have arisen in the market, we've seen an increase in volatility in the last week or 2. I expect those types of events to continue to happen. Therefore, our strategy of reducing our bucket should reduce our volatility. Again, I'll remind you, the strategy is not because we had a change of opinion on the credits. But should the situation in Europe deteriorate, as an example, and the ECB not provide liquidity because they feel the fiscal situation isn't keeping speed, that could have an impact on our views of our holdings, the speed of our execution and/or the credit views. So I can't say anything with precision, but I can analyze the dynamics that might affect the portfolio and be actively working on those risks to reduce the potential that those situations in Europe would impact us in any substantial way from here on out. Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Thank you very much, Eric, and welcome aboard. All right, we will now begin with your questions."
192,GV_001449_2008Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'll turn the meeting over to Ken Janke. Kenneth S. Janke Good morning and thank you everybody for joining us on our first quarter call. With me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO of Aflac Incorporated; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO of AFLAC Incorporated; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. Operations, Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and Tohru Tonoike is President and COO of Aflac, Japan and he joins us this morning from Tokyo. Before we begin, let me mention the Safe Harbor. I would like to point out that some of the statements is this conference call are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Security laws. Although we believe in statements are reasonable, we can give you no assurance they will be prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. The actual results in the future could differ materially from those that we discuss today. So, I'd encourage you to please look at our press release from last night for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our future results. Now, I would like to turn the program over to Dan, who will talk about the quarter and some comments on our businesses in the U.S. and Japan. Dan. Daniel P. Amos Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Overall, I am pleased with the way we started 2008. Although we just have one quarter under our belt, I believe we are well positioned to achieve our objective of operating earnings per share growth this year. Let me give you more detail about the quarter beginning with Aflac Japan As a leading contributor to our consolidated financial statements, we were very satisfied with Aflac Japan's operating and financial results in the first quarter of 2008. In addition, our top line was consistent with our budget for the year and the benefit ratio continued to improve as we expected. As a result, we again produced solid pre-tax earnings growth. I was especially pleased with Aflac Japan's continued sales improvement. I hope you remember that when we released the fourth quarter earnings, we said that Aflac Japan's sales would start slow in 2008. Personally, I thought the first quarter sales could be flat. That was largely because we knew it would take time to build momentum in the bank channels. In fact only 1% of sales came from the banks in the quarter. Yet despite our caution, we began the year with very good quarter. Total new annualized sales rose 5% to 27.6 billion yen. That result, is much better than we had anticipated and in line with our annual sales objective. With bank sales still in the infancy, we believe our solid first quarter sales benefited instead from recent product introductions. Medical sales improved sharply in the quarter, rising 17.6% over a year ago. Medical sales were helped by Gentle EVER, our non-standard medical product, which targets consumers aged 40 and older, who typically would not qualify for our standard EVER product. During the quarter, we sold 12,400 Gentle EVER policies. Gentle EVER sales of 1.4 billion yen accounted for approximately 15% of the medical sales in the quarter. Since we began marketing Gentle EVER last August, it became the number one selling non-standard product in Japan. We were also pleased with cancer insurance sales, up 2.8%. We expected to see solid cancer sales this year in par because of the favorable reception of our new Cancer Forte product. This product is the first major revision to our cancer policy in more than six years. Cancer Forte increases daily out-patient benefits, adds an annuity for newly diagnosed patients and offers the canceling and doctor referral benefit. On March 24th, Dai-ichi Mutual Life joined Aflac Japan in selling Cancer Forte. Earlier in the year we introduced the special cancer policy that allows existing policy holders to upgrade their coverage to that of the Cancer Forte. In the first quarter, we sold approximately 54,500 of these upgrade policies. We believe this will be an effective means for enhancing customers' coverage, while also leveraging our policy holder base to increase sales. We also believe sales of cancer medical insurance will benefit from the addition of our new sales channels. As we discussed, we expect to leverage our long standing and extensive relationships in the banking sector to secure a significant number of selling agreement once the banks could finally offer their products to the... over the counter. That is exactly what has happened. At the end of March, we had agreements with 55 banks to sell our products. That number rose to 90 on April, the 1st, and by mid-year, we expect that number of agreements to be about 150 bank distributors. One reason we expect the numbers to increase is endorsement of Aflac's products by the National Association of Shinkin Banks. This association of about 280 Shinkin banks chose Aflac as one of only four companies to provide third sector products. Not only was Aflac the only foreign company chosen but Aflac was the only company selected to sell both cancer and medical insurance. Even tough we don't know with certainty how much business the bank channels would generate, we believe this new channel will gain momentum as the year progresses. We look for significantly better bank channel sales in the second quarter and this new channel should give us greater confidence in achieving our sales adjective for the year. We are also very excited about the opportunity to sell Cancer Forte through an agreement with Japan Post network. As I am sure you are aware, Japan Post chose Aflac as the cancer insurance provider through their network company. Initially we expect to sell through about 300 postal outlets, beginning on October, the 1st of this year. Needless to say, we believe this is a great opportunity for both Japan Post and Aflac. We also believe we are benefiting from the training initiatives. New agents who have gone through the new associate basic training program have generated better production than those who started before the training program was implemented. Although recruiting has been more challenging due to the tighter labor market in Japan, we are still focused on expanding our traditional distribution channel. In that regard, we recruited 771 new associates or agencies in the first quarter, which was 14.9% higher than a year ago. Remember that we are also adding significant number of licensed agents this year through the bank channel. I firmly believe there is a strong need for our products in Japan and I think we are well positioned to achieve our sales objective of a 3% to 7% increase for the year. We believe that's a reasonable target and we expect to produce strong financial results that are consistent with our budget for 2008. Now let me turn to the business in the United States. We are pleased with Aflac U.S. for financial performance in the first quarter. Our top line was consistent, with our expectations and our pre-tax earnings were better than our target. Total new annualized premium sales were 0.4% to 353 million. We were not surprised that sales were sluggish. However, we did think that sales would be up about 3%. You will recall that in the fourth quarter press release, we expected first quarter sales to be weak. There were a couple of reasons behind I think. First, we pointed out that we have transferred $8 million of sales for the first quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of last year due to administrative changes that we had in processing conversions. Second, we also needed our agents, particularly our veteran agents pushed very hard at the end of 2007, and as result, sales were sharply down in January. In addition, we had one less production day in the first quarter compared with the year ago. I'd like to point out that sales improved after the weak start of the year. From the beginning of February to the end of last week, our sales were up 6.5%. The number of average weekly producer rose 0.2% in the first quarter. However, the number of new average weekly producers, are those who in their first year increased 2.7% in the quarter. Production of new associates rose 4.2% over last year, and in addition we were pleased with the growth of our new payroll deduction accounts, which was up 8.5% over last year. That leads us to believe that the fundamental approach to building an effective distribution is still working and we continue to focus on that. As we've said previously, we've been in weak economies. We have found it easier to recruit because of rising unemployment means salary jobs are more difficult to come by. We think the weaker U.S. economy resulted in good recruiting increase for the quarter. Recruiting was up 8.6% in the first quarter, so almost 6500 new associates. I know many of you have asked whether the U.S. economy is affecting other aspects of our business. As we've said before, we really have not experienced any material impact on claims or sales in fast economic downturns. The last recession occurred in 2001, when our sales were up 29%. That incredible sales growth was attributable to the success of the new Aflac duck advertising campaign, which could have simply mitigated any impact of the recession. Of course, we recognize that the current economy is impacting consumers and we are seeing lower penetration rates in accounts compared to last year. However, we are sure of one thing, the need for our products we sell have not changed. The incidence of cancer, accident and other serious health events does not fluctuate during economic cycles. In fact, I believe the need for our products is actually more compelling when the economy weakens because of the financial risk to the household, becomes more pronounced. With the price of food and gas climbing so rapidly, coping with those rising costs is even more burdensome to the health event occurs. That's precisely why our products provide distinct value to the average American households. We are taking steps to amplify that message to our sales force. This past Monday, we held a national training day that was offered to the entire sales force. One of the main objectives of this training day was to convey to the sales force, how a weak economy enhances a need for our products, and to train them how to better sell in this economy environment. Rest assured, we continue to take every opportunity we can to provide our sales force with the tools and skills that they need to be more successful. At the same time, there are other initiatives that we are working on, that we believe will help us tap into this fast U.S. market. At our analyst meeting next month, we'll talk about our new business-to- business marketing. This is the first time, we have directly approached business owners and we are excited about its potential. We have created business-to-business television commercials, which expect to begin running in May. These initial testings of these commercials was very high and we believe they will help us communicate our brand message to employers. We are also going to continue to segment the market to more effectively meet the needs of the specific consumers such as the Hispanic market. We will continue to enhance our distribution by looking more cautiously at the non-traditional channels such as national insurance brokers. I am pleased with the direction of our operation and enthusiastic about the opportunities we see in the marketplace. Our objective is still an 8% to 12% increase in sales for the full year and I expect our sales growth to improve, as I still believe our sales target is achievable, although it's obviously tougher than it was... than we had originally thought. I am counting on the marketing and sales officers as well as the field force to do what they can to help drive sales. I believe employers and workers alike are gaining a better understanding of our products and our services, and I am certain we have an effective combination of product, distribution, customer service and brand to meet customer needs. On a consolidated basis, I am pleased with the financial position. Our balance sheet is still marked by a conservative investment posture and very favorable risk profile. The credit ratings of our holdings remain high as you know and we do not have any direct investment exposure to sub-prime lending markets. We have limited investment exposure to CMOs asset-backed securities or CDOs, and all the investments in those areas are highly rated. We also have a very strong risk-based capital. Our RBC ratio for 2007 was 574. Although it declined some what from 2006, keep in mind that we transferred $1.4 billion to the parent company in 2007. That capital transfer allowed us to repurchase 12.5 million shares in February 2008. In other words, they impacted the funding of our 2008 share repurchase was reflected in 2007 RBC ratio. As I mentioned in our press release, we have narrowed our outlook for this year from a 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings on a diluted basis before the impact of currency to 14% to 15% increase. I have a high degree of confidence that we will achieve that target, and we hope to grow at the high end of that range this year. We are very pleased with our U.S. financial results, which were in line or better than expectations. At the same time, I am extremely pleased with Aflac Japan's continued recovery of new sales. Aflac Japan sales results exceeded our expectations for the quarter and as a contributor to more than 70% of the consolidated earnings, Aflac Japan's financial results were solid and consistent with our target. I am still focused on increasing operating earnings per share by at least 15% annually, excluding the impact of the Yen from my first 20 years as CEO. If attend our analyst meeting next month, you will hear about our 2009 earnings target. Beyond my first 20 years as CEO, I still think we can produce another ten years of double-digit earnings growth. As we look ahead, we believe our strong earnings growth will reflect our underlying earnings power of our insurance operations in Japan and the United States. It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying excess capital in a way that benefits shareholders. Ken? Kenneth S. Janke Thanks Dan. Let me briefly run through some of the first quarter numbers, beginning with Aflac Japan. Starting at the top line in Yen terms, revenues were up 2.7% for the quarter. Investment income growth of 0.2% was held back by the impact of the stronger Yen on Aflac Japan's dollar denominated investment income. And excluding the effect of the stronger Yen, investment income was up 5.1%. The annualized persistency rate for the quarter, excluding annuities was 94.4% compared with 94.8% in the first quarter of 2007. We believe the persistency was impacted by a higher proportion of the population as well as our customer base reaching retirement age, though we expect that this will not only influence persistency this year, but in 2009 as well. And looking at the operating ratios for the quarter, as we expected, the benefit ratio continue to improve over last year. It declined from 63.9% to 62.4% in the first quarter of '08. The expense ratio was 19.6%, up from 18.5% a year ago. The increase in the expense ratio was budgeted and in part attributable to greater spending on bank channel preparations. The pre-tax profit margins showed further improvement, rising from 17.6% to 18.0%. Pre-tax earnings rose 4.8% for the quarter in Yen, and again excluding the impact from the stronger Yen and net investment income, pre-tax earnings were up 10.6%. Investment yields declined slightly in the quarter in looking at government bonds. For instance, the average yield on an index of 20 year JGB's was 2.08% in the first quarter compared with 2.13 in the fourth quarter. That composite yield right now is a little less than 2%. However for the quarter, we invested our cash flow in Yen securities of 3.41% and including dollars, the blended rate was 3.85%. Portfolio yield at the end of March was 399. That was three basis points lower than year end and 13 basis points lower than a year ago. Overall as Dan mentioned, the credit quality of the portfolio remains very high. On a consolidated basis, securities rated double B or lower, represented only 1.9% of investments at the end of March that was unchanged from year end. And looking at Aflac U.S., revenues were up 8.4% in the quarter. Earned premium increased 9.3%. Investment income was up 1.3%. As expected investment income growth was muted by higher dividends that we had paid to the parent company in 2007. The annualized persistency rate of our U.S. business was 71.9% in the quarter compared with 73% a year ago. I would note however that on a rolling 12 months basis, there was only a 40 basis point change from the prior year. So looking at the operating ratios for the quarter, the benefit ratio was 52.4% compared with 52.7% in the first quarter of '07. The improvement in the benefit ratio largely reflected a change in accounting for internal replacements, which we adopted at the end of last year. The expense ratio was 31.4% compared with 31.7%, and as a result, the margin was 16.2%, up from 15.6% a year ago. Pre-tax earnings were up 12.6% for the quarter. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 7.03 versus 6.27 a year ago, although again we did not have significant cash flows going to investments this year. The yield on our portfolio was 7.01% at the end of March, up one basis point from year end but six basis points lower than a year ago. turning to some other items for the quarter, we did purchase 12.5 million shares, this purchase was executed through an accelerated share repurchase program that we had announced in January, excluding [indiscernible] 115 in the ratio, of debts total capital was 16.9% at the end of March compare with 1680, a year ago. Non return interest expense was 7 million for the quarter compare with 5 million a year ago, and parent company and other expenses were 10 million, up from six million in the first quarter of 2007, that largely reflected the timing issue between corporate expenses in the first and second quarter. Total company operating margin rose reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac, Japan and Aflac, US. Pre-tax margin improve from 16.7% to 17% and in the after-tax margin rose from 10.9 to 11.1%. On an operating basis, the tax-rate was little change it was 34.7 versus 34.6. And as reported operating earning per diluted share rose 19.5% to $0.98, the stronger increased operating earnings by $0.05 per share for the quarter and excluding the Yen's impact, operating earnings rose 13.4%. Up finally, and looking at the outlook for the balance of the year, as you heard from Dan, our objective for 2008 is a 14 to 15% increase in operating EPS excluding the impact of the Yen. That would suggest $3.73 to $3.76, assuming an identical exchange rate that we had in 2007. However, as you know the Yen is significantly stronger that it was a year ago, so we achieve our objectives in the Yen average as 101 to 105 for the full year, we would expect that will translate to reported earnings per of $3.95 to $4.09 for the year and under that same currency scenario second quarter operating earnings per share will likely be a $1 to a $2. Other the current first quarter... estimate is the $1.00 for the second quarter and 397 for the full year. I would now be happy to take your questions and we would like make sure that everyone has an opportunity to ask the questions. So please limit your question to one and then hopefully if you have more we can come back to you, Judie now I will turn the call over to you for polling. Question And Answer"
193,GV_001449_2009Q1,"Presentation Unknown Speaker <strong>Operator</strong> Good morning and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions). Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may wish to disconnect at this time. I'll now turn the meeting over to Mr. Ken Janke, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Jenke, you may begin. <strong>Ken Janke</strong> Thank you, Susan, and good morning everybody, and thanks for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. With me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and Chief Operating Officer of our US operations joins us from a national sales convention; Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer, and Tohru Tonoike, who is President and COO of Aflac Japan joins us from Tokyo. Before we begin, let me mention the safe harbor. I would like to point out that some of the statements in this conference call are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Securities Laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. I would encourage you to look at our recent quarterly press release for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our future results. Now, I’ll like to turn the program over to Dan to comment on the quarter and also the balance sheet and the outlook for the United States and Japanese operations. I will follow up with a few financial highlights, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Dan? <strong>Dan Amos</strong> Thank you, Ken. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Hope you had a chance to review our first quarter press release. I will comment on our operations in Japan and the United States but first I would like to discuss our balance sheet and capital position at the end of the quarter. As we mentioned in our press release yesterday, we elected to early adopt the new mark to market accounting. Although we did not get any relief on the pricing site, we believe the changes regarding impairment charges supports the long view of price recovery that we have held for many years. We believe analyzing Alfac's investment portfolio and potential other than temporary impairment for the long-term perspective makes sense. This long-term view reflects the way we approach and manage the investments supporting our policy liabilities. Our policyholder liabilities have long durations, particularly in Japan. As such we purchased long-duration assets to support those liabilities. Due to our asset liability matching approach and very strong predictable operating cash flows, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until they recover in value, which may be at their maturity. As a result, our approach has always been to take impairment charges for debt securities only when our credit analysis indicate we are unlikely to receive contractual interest and principal payments. We believe the robust accounting guidance supports that view. We did incur some credit losses in the first quarter. However at 152 million, they were manageable given the strong capital generation of our business. I do want to point out that 42 million of the charges on perpetual securities resulted from the application of equity impairment approach, because they were downgraded to below investment grade. The impairment of perpetuals did not affect our statutory financial statements, as we continue to believe we will receive interest and principal payments that are contractually due. If the pricing of the perpetuals remain unchanged as of March 31 levels, and there are no additional downgrades to below investment grade, we would expect to book 295 million of impairments during the remainder of the year under the equity impairment method. I want to emphasize two points. First, these charges would not impact GAAP shareholder equity. And second and most important, we would not record impairment charges for statutory accounting purposes. Overall, I remain pleased with the quality of our balance sheet. As you're well aware, the pricing for fixed maturities have deteriorated significantly since year-end. That resulted in a sharp increase in unrealized losses in our portfolio and a decline in the shareholder equity. However, because we hold our investments until maturity, the unrealized losses will not be realized if our credit analysis is correct, which we conclude the investment is good money. Again, we believe this view is fully supported by the recent changes in the mark to market accounting. Despite the ongoing decline in the global credit quality, the credit profile of our investments remain high. I'm sure you're not surprised that we experienced credit downgrades in our holdings in the first quarter. However, at the end of March, 95% of our fixed maturities in perpetual securities were investment grade compared to 98.2% at year-end. At the end of March, 86% of the perpetuals securities were investment grade. In addition to monitoring the overall credit quality of perpetuals securities in our portfolio, we are continually assessing deferral and risk extensions. Other than the securities of the Icelandic banks that we wrote off in the fourth quarter, everyone of the perpetuals securities we own is current on interest. We do own 102 million of fixed maturity upper tier 2 securities of an Austrian bank that deferred its coupon in the first quarter. That bank, Communal Credit, was contractually required to defer payment due to profitability test. The coupons on the securities are cumulative and additionally they provide interest on top of the coupon. Based on our extensive work on this credit, we continue to believe we will receive all interest payments and principals, and as a result we did not impair these bonds. I would also like to point out that we have not experienced any extension of principal at this point. You will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2008, we had three separate hybrid securities redeemed. On April 22 of this year, KBC Bank redeemed its upper tier 2 securities we own. For the balance of the year, we have four perpetuals securities totaling 235 million that are expected to be redeemed. As you're aware, the senior notes issued in 1999 matured earlier this month. It has always been our preference to refinance the notes in the debt market to preferably the Samurai market in Japan. However, due to the financial crisis, debt markets have been effectively closed to financial names, especially those without government guarantees. In addition, we are sensitive to the current interest rate costs and we are not willing to issue debt with excessive coupons. As a result, we elected to repay our maturing obligations using internally generated funds. We accomplished this through a loan from our principal life insurance subsidiary American Family Life Assurance Company to the parent Aflac Inc. It is important to note that the loan is an admitted asset on the insurance subsidiary's booked under statutory accounting principles. As a result, it does not negatively impact our RBC ratio. The loan has an annual interest of 7.13% and a term of three years with a provision for early repayment. Although the loan has a three-year term, we view it as short-term financing until the credit markets improve. At the time, our preference remains exploring the debt markets for longer-term financing. I would like to point out that the senior notes that matured were originally issued with a notion of about 450 million at 6.5% annual interest rate. We entered into a cross currency interest rates swap to convert dollar obligations into yen denominated notes at 55.6 billion yen at a 1.67 annual rate. By doing so, we estimated that we saved more than 200 million in interest payments over the life of the senior notes, which is almost twice the cost of the foreign exchange portion of the swap contract. The total cost of the swaps was 106 million. Our debt issue to mature occurs in July of 2010. Although that is more than a year away, we are already exploring options to satisfy the 40 billion in obligation. I continue to believe our regulatory capital position remains very strong. Our risk-based capital was 477% at the end of the year and I consider that number to be very impressive in light of the negative effect of the 25% strengthening of the yen dollar in 2008, as well as elevated credit losses for last year. Although we have not yet completed our statutory accounting for the first quarter, we believe the capital position remains very strong. We estimate that the RBC ratio was 479% at the end of March. I would like to assure you that our primary focus remains on Alfac's capital position. In fact every officer's incentive compensation for 2009 has a component link to maintaining the target of RBC ratio of 375. We recognize that shareholders are laser focused on capital adequacy and I believe it is important for our officer group to be aligned with those interests. At the same time, I want to ensure that we continue to concentrate on the business of running Aflac's core operations. Therefore, we are still using other important incentive compensation methods, such as traditional premium, sales, expense growth. Additionally, we used the RBC ratio as the only measure for our performance based restricted stock that were granted to the section 16 insiders this year. To earn these equity awards when they best in three years, we will have to maintain a targeted RBC level. Maintaining our shareholder dividend is also directly related to the statutory capital position and our ability to upstream funds the parent company. Based on the current results and expectations for capital generated in 2009, we do not expect any change to this year's dividend. Our statutory capital generation in the first quarter was strong. We estimate first quarter's statutory operating income exceeded $500 million. We believe it is important to many of our owners that we continue to pay the dividend. However, if deterioration in investment portfolio produces stress on our statutory capital position, we will certainly look to a modified dividend as a means of conserving capital. Now let me turn to a brief review of the operations beginning with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan performed very well both from an operation and a financial perspective in the first quarter 2009. Although sales are basically flat in the quarter, we were encouraged by our results in the first quarter. In the first quarter of 2008, we produced strong sequential sales growth from the new bank channels. In the fourth quarter, sales of all insurance and investment products at banks fell sharply with the emergence of the financial crisis. And bank third sector products including Aflac's were not immune. However in the first quarter of 2009, sales through the bank channels recovered some of the pricing, 5.2% on a sequential basis. Compared with the start of the banks channel sales in the first quarter of last year, sales were up 265%. At the end of March, we had selling agreements with 250 banks, which is significantly greater than the next closest company selling through banks. We continue to believe that the bank channel is a great opportunity for distribution of our product and we expect further improvement in this channel as the year progresses. We were also pleased with the sale of cancer insurance, which was up 7.4% for the quarter. Cancer insurance sales benefited from the new sales channel or the bank channel and Cancer Forte upgrade products we began offering last year. While medical sales were down 5.4% in the quarter, ordinary products 1% [ph]. We introduced two new life products in the first quarter. We think consumers will find these new first actor policies appealing. We also believe it will better position us to offer our primary third sector products in the future. In addition to launching new products, we expanded our reach through the recruitment of new agencies. In the first quarter, recruitment was up 35% over last year. We believe this increase reflected improved recruiting techniques as well as weak labor market in Japan. More importantly, we believe we can provide appropriate training that will turn recruits into producers. We continue to view Japan as a very good market for the types of products we offer. Although Japan's weak economic will certainly pose challenges, we still think the sales range of flat to 5% increase for the year is reasonable. Not surprising, Aflac US also faced challenges selling insurance in a weak economic environment. During the first quarter, total new annualized sales were down 6/10 of a percent. As we pointed out in the press release, we had six additional production days in the first quarter due to the moment in the production calendar. With the benefit of the extra days, sales would have been down approximately 6.5%. Despite the weak sales environment, we still produced premium income of 1.1 billion in the first quarter, an increase of 5%. As we assumed in our financial projections for this year, the persistency rate for the US business declined. Our first quarter persistency rate was about 98% of our planned assumption. Virtually all product lines and various policy durations showed higher lapses. That tells us higher lapses rates are directly linked to the recessionary environment. We believe our coverage is affordable for the average American family, yet we realized in these times and hardships, families have difficult choices to make. I would like to point out that the lapsation did not hurt Aflac US earnings. However, the lapse rates this year do put pressure on US premium and earnings growth in 2010. Like last year, we remain encouraged with the basic sales related activities of the US operations. The current labor market has provided good opportunities for expanding our commission sales force based on salaried jobs being on the comeback. In the first quarter, recruitment of new agents was up 25% to 8,100 new sales associates. The average number of weekly producing associates increased by 2.4% in the quarter and the average number of new weekly producers rose 12.1%. New payroll account growth was also up solid 9.9% over the first quarter of 2008 and payroll accounts opened by new agents was up 18.1%. We remain convinced that we have strong business model in the United States and we believe there are tremendous opportunities for our product line. We expect the US sales and persistency will continue to be influenced by the weak economic conditions. And although a challenge, we currently believe it is possible to produce flat sales to a 5% increase this year. From an earnings perspective, our objective remains 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share in 2009 excluding the impact of the yen. But I want to remind you that my number one priority is capital position. Our capital position remains strong yet with credit markets remaining distressed, I think it is unlikely that we will purchase shares in 2009 even though we finds the valuations very attractive. With no share repurchase, we would expect earnings growth to be at the low end of the 13% to 15% range, which is consistent with the comments on the fourth quarter conference call. Overall I believe we remain well positioned in the two best insurance markets in the world from a competitive standpoint. Our operations are performing well and our balance sheet is strong. Although we remain in very challenging times, I have great confidence in the future of Aflac. Ken? <strong>Ken Janke</strong> Thank you Dan. Before we get to your questions, let me briefly go through some of the first quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Total revenues rose 3.3% in the quarter ending in yen terms. Investment income was up 0.5%, which was held back due to the impact of the stronger yen and Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated portfolio. Excluding the effect of the stronger yen, investment income was up 4.6%. The annualized persistency rate excluding annuities in the first quarter was 93.9% compared with 94.4% in the first quarter of 2008. As we previously discussed, we believe the persistency was impacted by a higher proportion of the population and our customer base reaching retirement age. In addition however it is clear that the weak Japanese economy has also influenced policy retention. In terms of quarterly operations ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve as we had expected. It was 61.5% in the quarter compared with 62.4% a year ago. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen investment income, the benefit pressure would have been 61.3%. The expense ratio for the quarter was 19.5 compared with 19.6% in 2008. Expenses overall were in line with our plan and debt amortization was higher due in part to lower persistency. Reflecting the lower benefit in expense ratios, the margin improved from 18% to 19% in the quarter and with the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings were up 9.3% in yen. Again, excluding the impact of the stronger yen on the dollar-denominated portfolio, pretax earnings were up 11.2% in the quarter. For the first quarter, we invested our cash flows in yen securities at 4.13% and including dollars, the blended rate was 4.57. The portfolio yield at the end of March was 3.87 which was down three basis points from December and 12 basis points lower than a year ago. Turning to Aflac US, revenues rose 4.7% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the three months was 66.9% compared with 71.9. As Dan mentioned, the economy has undoubtedly influenced our lapse rates. I would like to remind you that was an annualized rate and our first quarter is generally the lowest quarter in terms of persistency. On a rolling 12 month average basis, the rate was 71.9 versus 73.6% for the prior period. For Aflac US operating ratios, the benefit ratio was 49.5%, down from 52.4% in the first quarter of 2008. The decline in the benefit ratio reflected the release of reserves related to the higher lapsation. Higher lapse rates also increased DAC amortization which rose 32.8% in the quarter and that was largely responsible for the increase in the operating expense ratio rising from 31.4% to 33.9%. The margin expanded and was 16.6% in the quarter compared with 16.2% a year ago. And as a result, pretax earnings rose 7.2%. Although we did not have a lot of cash flow go into new Aflac US investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 8.67, up from 7.03 a year ago. And the yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 7.18 which is up eight basis points from the fourth quarter and 17 basis points higher than a year ago. Looking at some other items, non-insurance interest expense was unchanged at $7 million in the quarter. Parent company and other expenses were $8 million, down from $10 million a year ago. Total operating profit margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and US. The pretax margin rose from 17% to 18.1% and on an after-tax basis the margin 11.8 up from 11.1. The tax rate was unchanged at 34.7%. We did generate $0.32 per share in operating or realized gains in the quarter, which is we said we trigger to offset tax losses we had previously booked. We also had $0.33 per share of realized losses which combined with those gains resulted in a net realized loss of a penny in the quarter. We also purchased some of our yen denominated corporate debt in the quarter. We brought back 5.4 billion yen of bonds at a purchase price of 3.86 billion yen or about 71% at par. The extinguishments of this debt resulted in a $10 million gain in the quarter or $0.02 per diluted share. As we reported, operating earnings on a per diluted share basis rose 24.5% to $1.22. The stronger yen in the quarter increased operating earnings by $0.09 cents per share. And excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per share increased 15.3% for the first quarter. I would like to comment on the outlook for operating earnings. As Dan mentioned, our objective is 13% to 15% excluding the impact of the yen on a per diluted share basis. However, as you heard, it is more likely it would be toward the lower end of the range this year as we do not anticipate purchasing any shares in 2009. A 13% increase would translate into $4.51 in operating earnings per share for 2009, assuming the same exchange rate. And although the yen has weakened to the dollar since last year, the average so far this year which is about 95 yen is still stronger than it was a year ago. If we assume the yen averages 100 to 105 for the full year, we would expect to report operating earnings of $4.47 to $4.59 per diluted share for 2009. And under that same currency scenario, we would expect second-quarter operating earnings per share to be $1.11 to $1.14. The current first call estimate for the second quarter is $1.15. I hope you will all attend or listen to our 2009 analyst meeting which will be coming up in just a couple of weeks. At that time, we will discuss our outlook for 2010 earnings targets. We would like to take your questions now. We have about 35 minutes to do so. I would hope you would just ask one question so we can make sure we get to everybody. Susan, with that I'll turn it back to you for the Q&A."
194,GV_001449_2010Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Aflac First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Janke, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Kenneth Stuart Janke Former Senior VP, Investor Relations Thank you, Caroline. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our First Quarter Call. Joining me in Columbus today is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of our U.S. Operations; Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Toru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan, joins us from Tokyo. Before we begin this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. The actual results in the future could differ materially from those we discuss today. As such, we'd encourage you to look at our recent quarterly press release for some of the various risk factors that could affect our future results. Now I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will talk about our quarter and operations in Japan and the United States. I'll follow up with just a few financial highlights for the quarter, and then we'll take your questions. Dan? Daniel Paul Amos Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Ken. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Overall, we’re very pleased with our results for the first quarter and believe we’re on track for achieving our primary financial objectives for both capital levels and earnings growth this year. Let me begin this morning's call with a review of our insurance operations beginning with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan produced strong financial results in the first quarter. Revenue growth was in line with our expectations. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand as expected, resulting in strong earnings growth for the quarter. We were especially pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. Total new sales for the quarter rose 10% to JPY 30.3 billion. Our first quarter sales continued to benefit from strong consumer response to the recent product introductions, effective promotions and channel expansion. First quarter medical sales were again strong, increasing 21.4% over the first quarter of 2009. Medical sales reflected the successful revision of our popular medical product EVER. As you know, we promoted this revised product with the Maneki Neko duck campaign, which became an overnight sensation in Japan last year. Our commercial featuring the maneki neko duck was the number one rated television ad among 2,300 ads running on the major TV stations in Japan when we first released it last year. In addition, the jingle from the commercial was the most popular cell phone download in Japan for six days in a row after it was released. To date, we have distributed approximately 1.6 million Maneki Neko ducks through Japan. We continued to produce strong sales in our ordinary life category. Ordinary life sales were up 64.4% in the first quarter, with the new child endowment product accounting for approximately 44% of the total ordinary life sales. We sold more than 29,900 child endowment policies in the first quarter at an average premium of JPY 155,600 per policy. Although the child endowment product has a lower margin than the health products, the premium’s almost 3x higher than the cancer in the medical products. As such, it's a solid contributor to both the top and bottom lines. In addition, we've been able to leverage our child endowment sales through cross-selling. In fact, for every 10 child endowment plans sold, our agents sold two additional policies to the same customers. We also experienced strong gains in the bank channel sales in the first quarter. March was the single largest month of production from this channel, and bank channel sales were a record JPY 3.1 billion in the quarter. That represents 6.5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2009 and a 206.6% increase over a year ago. At the end of March, a total of 352 banks represented Aflac Japan. We have a strong position within the bank channel and have significantly more bank selling for third sector products than any other insurer operating in Japan. We believe our objective of a 0% to 5% growth in 2010 is reasonable, and our first quarter sales results are a good start toward achieving that objective. However, we do not expect second quarter sales to be as strong as the first quarter, largely due to tougher comparisons. I'll remind you, for instance, that we introduced our popular child endowment product last March. As such, growth rates in the ordinary life product category for the remainder of the year will be much lower than we produced in the last several quarters. In addition, as we discussed in the fourth quarter conference call, we expect much lower sales contributions from our largest telemarketing-based agency. We also expect sales from Dai-ichi Life to be down for the full year. To put this in perspective, excluding the impact from these two channels, first quarter sales rose 21.7%. Yet despite these headwinds, we are encouraged by our 10% sales increase in the quarter and our prospects in Japan for this year and beyond. We continue to believe that Aflac Japan is positioned as the strongest competitor in the third sector in Japan. Let me turn to our U.S. operations. From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. performance was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. As expected, our persistency rate was lower than a year ago. The drop in the first quarter was attributable to the significant lapses at the Wal-Mart account. Excluding the impact from that large account, persistency improved to 72.3% for the first quarter, compared to 66.9% a year ago. However, as we expected, when we announced the loss of the account last March, the earnings impact from the loss of the account was actually very positive in the first quarter due to the sizable release of reserves we held for the block of business. As has been the case for the last several quarters, we continue to face sales challenges in the U.S. market. Total new annualized premium sales in the quarter were $316 million or 10% lower than a year ago. Although we weren't pleased with the sales decline, we were not surprised. I hope you remember my comment from the fourth quarter call when I said that we expected to see a sizable decline in the first quarter sales due in part to five fewer production days in the first quarter of 2010 compared to last year. The impact on sales from fewer days was approximately $16 million. However, that was largely offset by $13 million of sales from the new Aflac Group business. Beyond the tough comparisons, difficult economic conditions continue to pose obstacles to sales growth. Throughout this period of economic weakness, our veteran agents, in particular, face very challenging re-enrollment conditions. Because many businesses have reduced staffing, it's common for our sales associates to see fewer employees during re-enrollment, and the employees they do see are likely to be more cautious about spending. The impact from the sales through veteran agents is meaningful because approximately 70% of our total U.S. sales come from agents who’ve been with us more than one year. Remember, too, that approximately 90% of the businesses we sell through have fewer than 100 workers. Clearly, small businesses have been especially vulnerable in the current economy. Historically, we've been able to offset some of the impact of the weak economy through better recruiting. You may recall that recruiting was up an incredible 25% to 8,100 new agents in the first quarter of last year, which was our largest number of recruits in a single quarter. Our record recruiting a year ago coincide with a major internet recruiting campaign and some massive layoffs at large employers, which gave us a unique opportunity to recruit. Against that tough comparison, recruiting in the first quarter was relatively weak, with 5,900 new recruits. However, on a sequential basis, first quarter recruiting was up 6.9% than the fourth quarter. In addition to tough comparisons, we experienced some contraction in the number of sales coordinators, which has reduced our recruiting capacity. A portion of the coordinator reduction was strategic consolidation, and some was through attrition. We are currently evaluating our coordinator level to determine where we might need to rebuild. We've also changed the bonus structure for our state and regional coordinators from one that was based entirely on sales to a structure including people development. The comparison to last year's second quarter will be very difficult on a year-to-year basis. We expect to see recruiting decline for the second quarter. However, we expect to see better recruiting in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. In addition to expanding the size and capabilities of the traditional sales force, we are excited about the opportunities to enhance our distribution system with the addition of insurance brokers. Our efforts to build new and better relationship in the regional and large-account broker market began in 2007. In 2009, we officially launched an initiative called Aflac for Brokers. We have staffed our broker department with employees who have significant experience in broker sales. Although our entry into the distribution outlet is fairly recent, we're very pleased with our results so far. As I mentioned on our last conference call, an independent survey in January of this year found that Aflac is the number one preferred carrier of voluntary insurance among brokers. More importantly, our effort is translating into sales. In the first quarter, broker sales rose 30.6% over last year. That reflected the inclusion of the new Aflac Group business in the first quarter of this year, most of which is broker distributed. However, on a pro forma basis in which Aflac Group sales were included in the first quarter results, for both this year and last year, broker sales were still up 5.9%. You'll recall that we acquired Continental American Insurance Company, now branded as Aflac Group Insurance, in part to better meet the product needs of our broker distribution. At the same time, however, Group products should enhance the sales opportunity for our traditional sales force of individual associates. In fact, our sales force is very enthusiastic about the new Group products. We also believe this will better position us to tap into the large payroll account market, as larger businesses typically prefer Group products. Admittedly, we are not only new to the Group business; we are actually playing catch-up, as some of our competitors have been offering Group products through Group for many years. In addition, it may take some time for the Group sales to have a meaningful impact to the overall U.S. sales growth. However, we bought in scalable platform, and we expect to see strong sales growth in the Group side of our business in the future. In the short term, our outlook for new sales in the United States remains cautious due primarily to the weak economy and high levels of unemployment. Earlier this year, we established a 2010 target of 0% to 5% sales growth for the U.S. segment. We have since modified our objective to enable our U.S. officers to earn a small bonus if the sales are flat to down 5% in the first half, but that portion can only be paid if sales are flat to up 5% in the second half. We found this two-part bonus structure to be effective in motivating our management team when we used it in Japan three years ago, and we hope it will have the same impact on Aflac U.S. this year. Although I don't like the idea of paying a bonus for negative sales performance, I believe it's important to set reasonable targets. Given the circumstances, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors also felt the two-part bonus was appropriate for this year. I believe our objective for the second half of the year is achievable if we see improvement in employment levels of our core market, which compromises businesses with fewer than 50 workers. In the long run, our outlook for Aflac U.S. has not changed. We continue to view the U.S. market as under penetrated. Furthermore, following the enactment of the healthcare reform, we believe employers and consumers will increasingly understand the need for products we offer, just as they have in Japan. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated financial performance in the first quarter of this year. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share rose 11.5% for the quarter. Gross realized investment losses in the quarter were lower than in the fourth quarter and a year ago. However, because we generated $146 million of realized gains in the first quarter of last year to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards, net realized investment losses were higher than a year ago. As we noted in last night's press release, we booked $27 million of GAAP-only impairments on two perpetual securities using the equity impairment method. These impairments resulted from rating deterioration of these securities. As we repeatedly discussed, we are required by GAAP accounting to apply an aging schedule of unrealized losses to the perpetual securities that are classified as below investment grade. Our business continued to generate significant capital in the first quarter. Although we've not yet completed our statutory financial statement, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio was in excess of 525% at the end of March. Maintaining a strong RBC ratio remains a priority for us. Like last year, it's an important component of our management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our official objective for this year is to maintain the ratio range of 375% to 475%. However, we plan to work toward finishing 2010 with a higher RBC ratio than year end 2009 ratio of 479%. I realize that many of you have asked when we feel comfortable deploying capital again. As I noted last quarter, we would like to extend our record of 27 consecutive annual increases in the cash dividend to 28 and beyond. If the credit markets remain relatively stable, I think it's reasonable to expect the board to approve a dividend increase sometime during the second half of the year. Over the long run, our capital generation has allowed us to maintain a policy of steadily increasing the cash dividend. Additionally, we continue to believe it's appropriate to enhance shareholder value through prudent share repurchases. However, before we commit to resuming share repurchase, we will closely monitor global financial markets to make sure the worst is behind this. We will also regularly assess our capital levels and measure our RBC ratio. I think it's likely that the soonest we would consider repurchasing our shares is toward the end of this year or 2011. Our objective is to increase the cash dividend and resume share repurchase, but our greatest priority continues -- is to maintain a strong capital position. Yet at the same time, we are still focused on the income statement. In that regard, we reaffirmed the earnings outlook we previously communicated in 2010. Our goal this year is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12% before the impact of the yen. At our upcoming analyst meeting, we will discuss the outlook for 2011 earnings growth. I remain pleased with Aflac's position in the two biggest insurance markets in the world. We continue to believe Japan and the United States each have characteristics that make them perfectly suited to our products. Aflac has earned the distinction of being the best branded company for voluntary supplemental products in each country. Importantly, both markets offer opportunities for growth. In pursuing our objectives for this year and beyond, it's clear that we will continue to face some challenges. However, our business is strong from an operational perspective, and we have confidence in our business model and in our people. We also had to strengthen our balance sheet that will allow us to continue to fulfill the promises that we've made to the customers and the expectations of our shareholders. Ken? Kenneth Stuart Janke Former Senior VP, Investor Relations Thank you, Dan. Let me just take you briefly through some of the first quarter numbers, starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning at the top line in yen terms, revenues were up 3.6% for the quarter and investment income rose 2.5%. Excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 3.5% for the quarter. The annualized persistency rate, excluding the annuity business, was strong and little changed in the first quarter. The rate was 93.8% compared with 93.9% a year ago. In terms of operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over last year and was 59.5% in the first quarter versus 61.5% a year ago. The expense ratio also improved slightly at 19.1%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of '09. As a result of the lower benefit and expense ratios, pretax margin rose from 19% to 21.4% in the quarter, and with the expansion of the margin, pretax operating earnings increased 16.8% for the quarter in yen terms. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.46%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 2.67%. Although new money yields were lower due to spread compression in the purchase of higher-rated securities, they were above budget for the quarter. The portfolio yield was 3.75% at the end of March, down two basis points from the end of December and 12 basis points lower than a year ago. Turning to Aflac U.S., total revenues rose 3.7% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 45.5% compared with 49.5% a year ago. The decline in the benefit ratio reflected the higher lapsation from the Wal-Mart policies in the quarter. And higher lapses also increased DAC amortization, which was up 9% versus a year ago. The operating expense ratio rose from 33.9% to 35.4%, reflecting both the higher DAC amortization as well as higher advertising expenses, which were planned for the first quarter. The profit margin for the quarter was 19.1% compared with 16.6% a year ago. And as we indicated in last night's press release, the margin would've been approximately 16% without the impact of the benefit reserve release related to the Wal-Mart terminations. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.98% versus 8.67% a year ago. Like Japan, our new money yields in the U.S. segment were ahead of budget for the quarter. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 7.06%, down 11 basis points from the fourth quarter and 12 basis points lower than a year ago. Turning to some other items for the quarter. Noninsurance interest expense in the first quarter was $31 million compared with $7 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflected our debt issuance in 2009. Parent company and other expenses were unusually low in the first quarter of last year and rose from $9 million to $14 million in the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. As a result, the pretax margin rose from 18.1% to 20%, and the after-tax margin increased from 11.8% to 13% in the first quarter of this year. On an operating basis, the tax rate was unchanged to 34.7%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were a $1.35 compared with $1.22 a year ago. Realized investment losses were $0.06 per share compared with $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we realized investment loss of $77 million or $0.16 per diluted share, as we noted, $49 million of which came from the sale of the remaining of our holdings of Takefuji Corporation. And $27 million, as Dan mentioned, came from the equity impairment method charges on two perpetuals. We also realized investment gains of $47 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the quarter. $36 million resulted from the sale of securities. The remaining $11 million gain was due to the valuation of foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps as required by ASC 810, formerly known as SFAS #167. As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, ASC 810 eliminated the concept of qualified special purpose entities and required us to consolidate certain variable interest entities on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, we made a onetime cumulative adjustment, which reduced shareholders’ equity by $165 million. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41 and the stronger yen increased earnings by $0.05 per diluted share in the quarter. Finally, let me comment on the outlook for 2010. As you heard Dan say, we have affirmed our objective for 2010 of a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency. That would equate to $5.29 to $5.43 for the full year. Assuming an exchange rate of JPY 90 to JPY 95 to the dollar, we would be at $5.24 to $5.56. If the yen averages JPY 90 to JPY 95 for the second quarter, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38. We’d now be happy to take your questions. And to allow time for everyone to ask questions, please try and limit your questions to one. If you have more, we'll try and get back with you. Caroline, we'd be happy to go to the Q&A now."
195,GV_001449_2011Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Aflac First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, our Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of U.S. Operations; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy Chief Financial Officer; Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer; and Toru Tonoike, President and Chief Operating Officer of Aflac Japan, who's joining us remotely from Tokyo. Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward looking within the meaning of federal securities guidelines. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed. We encourage you to look at our quarterly report for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. Now I'll turn our program over to Dan, this morning, who's going to begin with some comments about the quarter and our operations in both Japan and the U.S. I'll follow up with a few financial highlights for the first quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dan? Daniel Paul Amos Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I hope you've had a chance to review our first quarter press release. I'll comment on our operations in Japan and the United States. But first, I'd like to discuss what's been going on in Japan over the last 6 weeks. Clearly, the earthquake and tsunami on March 11 and the subsequent nuclear situation presented Japan with one of the biggest crises it's ever faced. The whole world watched helplessly through television and social media as devastating pictures and news coverage of the disastrous situation unfolded. We've been operating in Japan for more than 35 years. If there's one thing we've found in developing such close ties in Japan, it's that the Japanese people are resilient. And when I visited Japan the week after the earthquake, I saw this resilience. Our employees are safe, our business operations are running, and we do not expect any material impact on claims or earnings this year. Life is moving forward for most Japanese citizens and so is our resolve to be there for our policyholders during their time of need by paying claims just as we promised. Aflac Japan generated strong results in the first quarter, and we're again pleased with the financial performance of our largest earnings contributor. Revenue growth showed continued improvement rising 3.7% for the quarter. In addition, our pretax margin continued to expand, resulting in solid earnings growth for the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum in the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan generated the largest first quarter production in its 36-year history. New annualized premium sales exceeded our expectations and rose 12.6% to JPY 34.1 billion. With the expanding bank channel in mind, Aflac Japan has developed innovative products that align well with the product needs of banks. Bank sales in the first quarter posted another record with sales of JPY 7.9 billion, which represents an increase of 12.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and a 154% increase over the first quarter of 2010. I mentioned how we believe more banks, and mega banks in particular, would step up their efforts in selling Aflac's products, and that's exactly what we've been seeing. At the end of March, Aflac Japan was represented by 364 banks and more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan. While many banks have agreed to sell our products, turning that agreement from ink on paper into sales does not happen overnight, especially with more than 20,000 branches representing the 364 banks. It will take some time to facilitate training at all these locations but we're seeing sales steadily improving at many of these banks as training takes place and the banks expand their offering of Aflac products. In many of the banks, sales representatives had gained experience at selling our products, and their confidence level and their sales ability has grown. WAYS and child endowment products, which are both especially popular with banks, were key drivers to growth again in the first quarter. You'll recall that WAYS is a unique hybrid whole life product that's being converted to fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefit when the policyholder reaches a predetermined age. The real story can be seen in WAYS' phenomenal sales growth rate, which was an increase of 221%, compared to the first quarter of 2010. Consumers find WAYS attractive because of the guaranteed principal and the future flexibility of the benefit options. Banks like to sell this product because of its high premium and attractive commission, and Aflac's product margin on WAYS is significantly enhanced when policy holders elect to pay all the premium upfront through the discounted advanced premium. Importantly, 90% of the customers at the banks choose this payment option. As our banking channel becomes a greater contributor to our top line growth, we expect sales of this innovative and flexible product to grow significantly in 2011. As I mentioned, the other strong driver to sales growth is child endowment product, which was up 58.9% in the first quarter. This product is primarily used to help fund the higher cost associated with child's entering high school or college in Japan. Child endowment policies have been very popular in Japan for many years. Aflac's strong brand, this product's unmatched return and our expanding presence in banks are competitive advantages that have helped make our child endowment policy the product of choice. You'll recall that the average premium for child endowment is much lower profit margin, but because it is wanted and needed in the bank channel and is about 3x the premium of the medical policies, the premium is a very solid contributor to top line growth. It's also helpful in enhancing our policyholder base, allowing us the opportunity to cross sell additional products like WAYS to consumers. Like WAYS, our child endowment offers a discounted advanced premium, and the profit margin on the child endowment more than doubles when the policyholders elect to pay premiums upfront using the discounted advanced premiums. About half of the consumers who purchase child endowment through the banks elect the discounted advanced premium method of payment. As expected, cancer insurance sales were down 10.4% for the quarter as prospective policyholders and sales agents postponed cancer insurance purchases and sales in anticipation of the introduction of the new base cancer policy DAYS, which was introduced at the end of March. The enhancement of this new base policy speaks to the changing landscape in cancer treatment as well as our commitment to retaining the #1 provider of cancer insurance in Japan. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 17.5% of total sales. Keep in mind that the foundation of our product portfolio has been and continues to be cancer and medical products. Importantly, we maintain our position as the #1 seller of medical products in Japan, which confirms the continued popularity and demand for our innovative policies. The solid platform we established with these 2 pillar products has allowed us to leverage our competitive advantages such as branding and administrative efficiencies to grow our product offering and meet the evolving needs of the consumers. From top to bottom, Aflac Japan performed extremely well in the first quarter, especially in light of the natural disaster and tough sales comparisons to a year ago. But as I've told you, following 2 years of strong sales growth, the sales comparisons only get tougher as the year goes on especially in the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, we believe the natural disaster has affected our sales, primarily in the affected regions, but I still believe we can achieve our sales target for the year in the range of down 2% to up 3%. Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. We were very pleased and excited with Aflac's U.S. performance from both the sales and a financial perspective. For the first time in 9 quarters, Aflac U.S. generated positive sales growth, and new annualized premium sales were up nicely, generating a 6.3% sales increase. We were especially encouraged to see an increase in production from both new and veteran agents. In fact, we saw crossover where Aflac career agents embraced group products. To me, it all boils down to giving our customers a choice between group and individual products. As I've said before, I tell our entire U.S. distribution system that I don't care whether they sell group or individual products but I do care that they give the group or the individual platform options to the employers with more than 100 workers. That's because if they don't at least let these accounts know we offer the group options now, you can bet that someone else will. I truly believe that if the employer wants group products, and they know Aflac offers them, they'll choose Aflac over the competition. For both group and individual products, we are driving sales through specific product pushes called smart launches, which are modeled after Aflac Japan's product launches that effectively focus on the entire sales force on selling one specific product during a specific period of time. Our first smart launch was in the first quarter, and it focused on the Dental product. The results were phenomenal. Our dental category generated a 37.1% sales increase and contributed 6.9% to the total annualized premium sales. We've also seen success with the Critical Illness product created for the group platform. While this product was only introduced in mid-2010, it has provided both our traditional sales force and brokers with valuable products to add to accounts that currently have cancer products on an individual basis. This is a good example of a product that helps career agents transition and expand their portfolio to include not only individual products but also group products. On the distribution side, our strategy, we've said many times before that today's recruits are tomorrow's sales. With that in mind, in early January, we launched our first ever recruiting campaign utilizing national television advertising. It featured a commercial with successful agents sharing their story and generating phenomenal leads, which ultimately contributed significantly to our 13.5% increase in recruiting for the first quarter. As you can see, we've taken measures to better reach potential customers with some innovative products, benefit solutions -- and we've improved Aflac U.S. sales not only to reflect intense focus on supporting our field force with enhanced products but also reflects the better resources and training that helps our sales force better approach selling in the current environment. We will continue to help our entire distribution, new and veteran agents, as well as brokers, with ways they can provide and improve their performance because they are essential part of our strategy and our success. All of these elements are fundamental to the model that we've been following in the U.S. We call it ""recruit, train, motivate and sell."" For those of you who will be coming to the financial analysts briefing in New York on the May 17 and 18, we'll be sharing more about this model and the products that we're going to introduce. We continue to believe the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with that potential in mind. We also believe our expectations that Aflac U.S. sales growth for 2011 will be flat to up 5% is reasonable, and our first quarter sales are a good start toward achieving that objective. Given the state of the economy, we still remain somewhat cautious. In addition, this is a momentum business. Although our 6.3% sales increase is a great start, I would obviously like to see the momentum build for a few quarters. It is clear, however, that the addition of group product platforms and our growing broker initiative only serve to enhance our ability to leverage Aflac's brand and to reach more companies, large and small, across the United States. Now let me update you on Aflac Inc.'s results. Overall, we're pleased with Aflac's consolidated performance. Operating per share diluted rose 15.6% to $1.63. Excluding the benefit of the stronger yen operating earnings per diluted shares rose 8.5%. We believe that our basic investment approach of effectively managing assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach for our policyholders and shareholders. As you've heard us say repeatedly since early 1990s, our greatest challenge is investing huge cash flows in Japan's low interest rate environment. To reiterate what we said in our year-end conference call, one of our top focuses in 2011 is concentration risk. While our largest exposures are predominantly a legacy issues, we have continued to look at ways to optimistically reduce some larger positions where practical. As I said last week on CNBC, we focused on growing our operating earnings while derisking to further enhance the quality of the portfolio. I don't think many of you fully recognize the extent of our investment portfolio derisking activities that we've been actively engaged in over the last couple of years, so I'm going to cover 4 major derisking actions that we've taken to remind you of what we've accomplished. For instance, as we began 2009, our holding of perpetual subordinated securities was approximately 13% of the portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, perpetual subordinated debt accounted for less than 9% of the portfolio, a 30% decrease. We also de-risked the portfolio by lowering our concentration in financial exposures. At the start of 2009, banks and other financials made up 41% of the total portfolio, and at the end of the first quarter of this year, the number had dropped to 33%, a 20% decrease. We've accomplished this by both selling assets as well as reducing the percentage of new investments allocated for the financial sector. We also reduced our exposure to the PIIGS countries. At the start of 2009, these sovereign and financial exposures made up approximately 6% of the total portfolio. At the end of the first quarter, that number has declined to 4%, a 33% decrease. As I've already suggested, we are now focused on addressing some of our legacy issues, especially some of those highly concentrated positions. Within the PIIGS portfolio, we've started with lowering the exposure in 2010. And in the first quarter of 2011, we focused our efforts on reducing our exposure to Greek financial system. Today, our holding of Greek banks has been reduced by 82% from the beginning of 2011. This percentage decline also reflects the sale of one of the banks following quarter end. In addition to significantly reducing our exposure to Greek financial systems, we also focused on reducing some of our larger concentrated positions where practical. As such, we sold some of our holdings in available-for-sale categories that exceeded 10% of tax. We believe these actions to lessen the concentrated risk in our investment portfolio further strengthens our balance sheet. Our business continues to generate significant capital in the first quarter. As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital ratio or RBC remains a top priority for us, and you'll recall that it remains a primary component of the management incentive plan for all Aflac officers. Our objective for 2011 is to derisk our portfolio while maintaining our RBC ratio in the range of 400% to 500%, with a target of 450%. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our RBC fell within the range of 500% to 525% at the end of March. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategies. As you'll recall, 2010 marked the 28th consecutive year of a dividend increase. Our objective remains to increase cash dividends generally in line with earnings growth before the impact of the yen. We will again evaluate a dividend increase later this year, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases for 29 years. Additionally, you'll recall that we resumed the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. We purchased 3.1 million shares in the first quarter and anticipate purchasing 6 million to 12 million shares for 2011. However, we will balance our share repurchase activities this year with the derisking opportunities that ultimately enhance our portfolio. With the first quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well positioned for another year of solid financial performance. We still believe our goal of increasing operating earnings per diluted share is reasonable and attainable. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing Aflac Japan and U.S. operations, especially the expense control. As the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly in marketing and IT initiatives. And we have said previously, given the continued low interest rate environment, especially in Japan for 2011, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of yen. As you know, we historically announced our earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting. Although we have not yet finalized our projections for 2012, I can tell you that our expected rate of earnings growth next year will likely be lower than 2011 due primarily to the portfolio derisking activity and the continued low interest rate environment in Japan. After the effects of the derisking and the low interest rates in Japan and the United States have fully integrated into the financial results, we should expect to see the rate of increase in earnings begin to improve. With respect to achieving our objectives, you've heard me say many times before that we manage this company for the long term. As such, we believe that derisking our portfolio is more important than the effect on one year's earnings, and in doing so, we'll ultimately enhance the shareholder value. Now I'll turn it back over to Robin. Robin? Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Thank you, Dan. And as Dan said and you are all aware, the quakes and subsequent tsunami that hit Japan on March 11 had a devastating impact on the country, and they remain in our thoughts and prayers. But I'd like to go through some of the numbers to-date that reflect the magnitude of this event. According to the official report by Japan's National Police Agency, as of April 28, total lives that were lost is 14,575, and there are still 11,324 who are missing. There are also 5,277 who are reported injured. We estimate that there will be a total impact of JPY 3 billion in claims, and of this amount, we booked a total of JPY 1 billion to incurred claims, and the remaining, approximately JPY 2 billion, will be handled through reinsurance plans we have and offsetting reserve releases. There was also JPY 0.7 billion of operating expenses resulting from the earthquake and tsunami. Now I'd like to go through some first quarter numbers for Japan. Beginning with the top line, in yen terms, revenues were up 3.7% for the quarter. Investment income was down slightly 0.7%. However, excluding the effect of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net income rose 2.7% in the quarter. Annualized premium persistency rate, excluding annuities, was 94.3% compared to 93.8% in 2010. In terms of quarterly operating ratio, the benefit ratio improved over last year, moving from 59.5% a year ago to 59.0% in the first quarter. The expense ratio for the quarter was 18.6%, down from 19.1% a year ago. As a result, the lower benefit and expense ratios to pretax margin rose from 21.4% to 22.4% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, pretax earnings increased 8.5% for the quarter in yen terms. For the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen securities at 2.36%, and including the dollars invested, the blended rate was 3.16%. As we discussed last year, part of our strategy to address the low interest rate environment in Japan, we made dollar-denominated purchases to extend the $1 billion we discussed in the fourth quarter of the year and the amount $290 million. That amount, purchase through the end of Japan for that objective, totaled $993 million. The yield on these investments was 4.26%. Our portfolio yield rose 3.56% at the end of March, no change from the end of December and 19 basis points lower than a year ago. Now turning to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 3.1% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio was 48.8% compared with 45.5% a year ago. The rise in the benefit ratio reflected a return to a more normalized number in 2011 following the decline in the benefit ratio in 2010, which resulted from the loss of a large account. The operating expense ratio decreased from 35.4% to 32.0%, reflecting a delay in spending on several projects that will be incurred later in the year. Also driving the operating expense number down to the first quarter was a return in amortization to a more normalized number after the loss of the large account increased the 2010 debt number. The profit margin for the quarter was 19.2% compared with 19.1% a year ago. In terms of U.S. investment, the new money yield for the quarter was 5.77% versus 5.98% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was 6.84%, down 8 basis points from the fourth quarter and 22 basis points from a year ago. Now turning to some other items in the quarter. Noninsurance expense for the first quarter was $41 million compared with $31 million a year ago. The higher interest expense primarily reflects our debt issuance in the second half of 2010 of $750 million. Our parent company and other expenses remained flat at $14 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Total company operating margins rose, reflecting the improved profitability of Aflac Japan and U.S. Pretax margins rose from 20.0% to 20.7%. The after- tax margin increased from 13.0% to 13.5%. And on an operating basis, the tax rate remains relatively unchanged at 34.2%. Net earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.84 compared to $1.35 in 2010. Realized investment losses were $0.79 per share for the quarter compared to $0.06 per share in 2010. During the quarter, we realized investment losses of $376 million net of tax or $0.79 per diluted share, primarily as a result of the significant derisking activities in the quarter that Dan outlined. $115 million was attributable to our sale of holdings in the Alpha Bank, $258 million resulted from the impairment of 2 other Greek banks: National Bank of Greece and EFG Eurobank. We also lowered our holdings of other concentrated positions with smaller transactions and impairments, and these transactions altogether resulted in a gain of $16 million. The remaining $19 million loss is associated with derivative and hedging activity. As reported, our operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.63. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.10 per diluted share. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.5% for the quarter that was in our annual range of the low end of 8% to 12%. Lastly, let me comment on earnings outlook for 2011. As you heard, we have affirmed our objective for 2011 with an 8% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the Yen. But as we've previously said, given the low interest rate environment, especially in Japan, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the Yen impact. Assuming an 8% increase in operating earnings per share growth, we would expect to earn $5.97 on a constant currency basis. If the Yen averages 80, 85 for the second quarter we would expect operating earnings to be $1.51 to $1.57 per diluted share. If we achieve our objective of that 8% growth, and the Yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect EPS to be in the area of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. As we mentioned in our press release last night, although we historically announce earnings guidance for the following year at our May analysts meeting, and our 2012 earnings projection is not finalized, we do anticipate that earnings for the next year, 2012, would likely be lower than 2011. Let me take this opportunity to remind you that our annual analyst meeting will be held in New York City on May 17 and 18. We'll be there to provide you with further updates on our operations in both the U.S. and Japan along with our outlook for this year and the following year, so we invite you to please log in and register to attend. I'm now ready, Diane, to start taking questions. To be fair to everybody, please limit yourself to 1 question, and we'd be happy now to start with the questions."
196,GV_001449_2012Q1,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Aflac First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. Joining me this morning here in Columbus is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, First Senior Vice President, Chief Global Investment Officer; and joining us remotely this morning is Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of U.S. Operations; and Toru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan, who's joining us from Tokyo. Before we start, let me remind you that some statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discuss today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly report for some of the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. Now, I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in Japan and the U.S. I'll follow up with a few highlights for the first quarter and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dan? Daniel Paul Amos Chairman, President & CEO Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased that we met and, in many cases, significantly exceeded our financial and operational targets for the first quarter. Let me begin with an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. Following an impressive 2011, we again, are pleased with Aflac Japan's financial performance with their tremendous sales momentum in the first quarter. New annualized premium sales rose 53.8% to JPY 52.4 billion for the quarter, which surpassed our expectations and set a production record for the third straight quarter. Revenues grew 7.8% and pretax earnings were up 3.2% for the quarter. Bank channel sales has been a huge factor in the tremendous sales growth over the last couple of years. We told you at the end of the year that we expected new annualized premium sales through the bank channels in the first quarter to be up more than 150%, and they were actually up 208% over the first quarter of 2011. As you will recall, our unique hybrid whole- life product, WAYS, has been a significant contributor to the bank channel growth. There are 3 principal reasons why selling WAYS has benefited our business. First, due to its much higher premium, it's a strong contributor to the top line growth. Although our margins are lower than our healthcare products, WAYS contributes to the bottom line. It's important to note that the profit margin on WAYS sold using the discounted advance premium method is 8% to 12%, and more than 90% of the consumers purchasing WAYS through banks select this payment method. But I'd point out that if we use the new money yields for WAYS' cash flows, are just 25 basis points higher, the profit margin range would be 13% to 17%. At our analyst meeting next month, we will give you some additional color on the margins and the returns on the WAYS product. The second reason we sell WAYS is because this product gives us access to new customers. I'll point out that 80% of the customers at the banks are new to Aflac. Also, the average age on WAYS purchasers is 43, which is appealing to us because that age is in the segment of the market, which is 25 to 49, where we are under penetrated. The third reason we're selling WAYS is because this product helps us solidify the relationships we've worked hard to establish with banks. Aflac has agreements with 372 of the 403 banks in Japan. We believe this number is significantly greater than any of our competitors. Our bank channel has significantly reach into Japan with more than 20,000 branches. Japanese consumers rely on banks not only to provide traditional bank services but also to provide insurance solutions among other services. As such, our partnership with the banks provide us with a very different demographic of potential customers than we otherwise have been to reach. And it also allowed the banks to expand their products and offerings to consumers. Low interest rates in Japan has been challenging for many years and even more so compared to this time last year. But understand, we are currently in the process of evaluating the pricing of our entire product line using lower interest rates. I can tell you that we will definitely be working on repricing our ordinary life products over the next year. Keep in mind this takes some time because it involves an alignment of sales and promotional programs as well as system changes. We are also looking at different asset allocations that would generate better returns on the premium income generated from WAYS. Following an extensive analysis of our WAYS products, we concluded that 5 pay [ph] version of WAYS that we started selling through the bank channels in June of 2011 would be more susceptible to intermediation at its paid-up date. Therefore, we took action to limit the production of this particular version of WAYS for both the bank channel and our traditional agencies. Thanks to the strong relationship we have with banks, we've been successful at reaching production caps agreements for the 5 pay WAYS [ph] production channel. I would note that there are significant surrender penalties for this product until the paid-up date. Taking an extreme case, if every 5 pay [ph] WAYS product cancel their policy to paid-up date, we would not have the liquid investment. Instead, we would fund the payouts from the investable cash flows, which significantly exceed our cash surrender values that would be claimed. And this type of scenario would only be likely if interest rates, or interest yields, on new investments are significantly higher than they are today. Obviously, the higher rates would benefit our investment returns on net new money that we would have to invest. With respect to Aflac Japan's traditional sales channel, the tremendous sales results in 2009 and 2010 from the EVER products in the Maneki Neko Duck campaign created tough comparisons in 2011. As you will recall, our traditional sales channels produced flat sales last year. As I said last quarter, that I expected sales from the [indiscernible] channels to be up in 2012. First quarter sales results for this channel actually increased 9.1%. So we're off to a good start. Keep in mind that the foundation of Aflac Japan's product portfolio has been, and will continue to be, the third sector cancer and medical products. Aflac Japan remains the #1 provider in the third sector market by continually to revise and developing products that are relevant to the consumers' needs. It's our objective to retain the #1 position. In the first quarter, our cancer sales were up 14.2%. We also upgraded the new EVER product toward the end of January, and initial results of this product revision is being well received by consumers. We believe sales of this product will benefit the medical category. Finally, I'd like to point out that excluding production of the 5 WAYS pay [ph], sales would still be up roughly 25.9%. Based on Japan's strong first quarter, we now expect total annualized premium sales to be up 10% this year. Now let me turn to the U.S. operation. It has been and continues to be our long-standing vision to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance in the United States, a position we've held for many years. Aflac U.S. generated a 4.5% increase in new annualized premium sales in the first quarter, which is right in line with our annual sales expectations of a 3% to 8% sales increase. Keep in mind the majority of our enrollments were in the fourth quarter. Aflac U.S. revenues rose 5.2% and pretax earnings were up 8.1% for the quarter. I would also note that first quarter of 2012, our persistency remained very strong. We continue to expand Aflac's potential to connect with employees at more companies, large and small. And as you'll recall, our strategy for growth is to offer relevant products through expanded distribution channels to reach those employees. While the U.S. economy has shown some signs of recovery, we believe smaller employers continue to find the environment challenging and we still remain somewhat cautious until we see greater gains in the employment trend. However, the 2009 addition of group products to our existing portfolio has allowed us to leverage Aflac's strong brand and to provide more options for customers of both our traditional and broker distribution channels. We will continue to sell through smaller businesses while also engaging in large case market, which is dominated by the large brokers. At the beginning of this year, we launched an initiative to address the largest insurance brokers. We believe that Aflac's potential for growth in the larger case market is tremendous. Keep in mind, building relationships and trust with larger brokers takes time. It is a process, not an event. But I can tell you that we are making tremendous inroads. You'll hear more about this at the analyst meeting in May. With both operating segments continuing to perform well, as I've said, investments in capital management are my top priorities as CEO. In that regard, I'm extremely pleased with our activities in the quarter. Let me begin with investments. Our realized investment losses for the first quarter were $29 million. Let me take you back to our discussions at the end of the fourth quarter. You'll recall we identified a group of assets with larger risks to European countries with the intent to sell those assets. We impaired those assets to fair market value at the end of the fourth quarter. This strategy did not reflect the change in opinion on the credits of these assets, but rather well-defined plan to reduce our overall exposure to Europe, particularly in the financial sector. Our goal was to reduce our exposure to European financials by approximately JPY 150 billion by June 30. I am pleased to report to you that we have liquidated more than 85% of that target. I'm also very encouraged that we have substantially completed this program, and on top of that, the prices we received for these securities were generally better than the price that we had impaired them to at the end of the fourth quarter. With respect to derisking, I'm very pleased that we made significant progress in enhancing the quality of our overall investment portfolio. Volatility in Europe lessened in the first quarter, but since the end of March, it's increased somewhat. Keep in mind we reduced our overall European exposure from $29.5 billion at the end of 2011 to $27.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. So potential impact to further European volatility on our investment portfolio is lower. While we still view Europe as an area of investment risk, I believe our portfolio is better positioned to accommodate market volatility in the future. As always, we will closely monitor, evaluate and reevaluate our portfolio with an eye for credit issues that may emerge. Let me remind you of how successful we've been in substantially enhancing our investment portfolio over the last few years. From January 2008 to the end of the first quarter of 2012, we've dramatically cut our holdings in sovereign and financial investments in the PIIGS countries from 5.9% to 2.1% of total investments in cash. We also lowered our investments in perpetual securities by more than half, going from 14.7% of total investments and cash to 5.5% or $5.5 billion. I'd also like to point out that none of the perpetual securities we currently own are in the PIIGS countries. As we pursue opportunistic investment transactions, we will continue to look for ways to reduce our exposure to European debt. I'll also update you on a few other investment topics. As you'll recall, we engaged the services of McKinsey, a leading management consulting firm, to conduct a strategic and global review of our investment processes, people and system. McKinsey's analysis includes key recommendations relating to the creation of a global investment organization with complementary risk management, credit, asset allocation and outsourcing capabilities that enhance our ability to be a world-class investment organization. With the analysis complete, you'll hear more about this in May. But let me say I'm very pleased with our strategy to build and enrich the capabilities of our investment function, as is our Board of Directors. Additionally, as we also discussed, we partnered with Goldman Sachs Asset Management to conduct a comprehensive strategic asset allocation project that accounts for Aflac's specific liabilities and capital requirements. We engaged this study to develop an investment program that will likely expand our investment opportunities beyond what our current programs afford us. We expect this analysis to be finished by the end of June and it will impact how we invest in different asset classes, including the implementation of outsourcing to third-party investment managers. Once we get the results, we will be able to share this with you in more detail. A global strategic asset allocation program that presents an opportunity for us to significantly improve the risk and return profile of our balance sheet. We know that there are new investment opportunities that Aflac can take advantage of and we expect this project to help us with strategy going forward. We believe these efforts will improve benefits to the policy holders and shareholders in terms of higher quality of future investment earnings. The success of derisking activities included the receipt of deferred coupon that allowed us to accelerate the funding of this critical global initiative while still achieving our operating earnings per share objective this year. While it's too early to discuss our strategy in detail, Eric is on the call today and I'm sure he'll be happy to respond to your questions. What I can tell you is that we believe that by considering a broader set of asset classes and investment opportunities, we will improve the overall quality of the portfolio over the long term. Now I'll turn to Aflac's consolidated financial performance. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 7.4% to $1.74 for the quarter, excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 4.9% for the quarter. We also had a strong quarter with respect to our capital position. The strength of our capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders as well as the shareholders. As we've communicated, over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital or RBC ratio remains a priority for us. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate our RBC ratio was between 500 and 540 at the end of March, which is considerable increase from our year end of 493. As you know, our capital adequacy in Japan is particularly -- is principally measured by our solvency margin ratio. We also expect that Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio improved significantly over year end 2011. I believe we've done a good job at protecting our policyholders' interest while also being mindful of the shareholders. We increased our cash dividend to shareholders in 2011 for the 29th consecutive year. Our objective is to grow the dividend at the rate in line with our earnings per share before the impact of the yen. I believe dividends are an important component of the value we provide the investors. We will again evaluate a dividend increase as the year progresses, but I am confident we will extend our consecutive annual dividend increases to 30 years. As we have indicated, given our capital structure, our ability to repurchase shares is largely tied to profit repatriation. We mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we estimated 2012 profit repatriation to be about JPY 25 billion, assuming no additional material investment losses through Aflac Japan's FSA fiscal year end. We still believe that's a reasonable estimate. We will make a decision about the amount of money we will transfer from Japan to the U.S. around mid-year. In thinking of that decision, we'll be taking into consideration the needs of our stakeholders in Japan, including our policyholders, but we will continue to be cautious about deploying that capital. If we do purchase any shares this year, it would be late in the fourth quarter. Keep in mind there are many factors involved in this decision and we'll closely monitor our options. Importantly, we don't need to repurchase shares to make our 2012 earnings. Furthermore, assuming we incur no material investment losses between now and mid-2013, we would expect to maintain a strong solvency margin ratio and significant capacity for profit repatriation and share repurchase. You'll recall, we previously shared that our 2012 operating earnings objective was 2% to 5% growth before currency. We expect the new accounting for DAC to lower earnings per share by approximately $0.05 this year. However, we believe we can cover that impact and still achieve our original target of $6.46 to $6.65 per diluted share before the currency. That means our range for this year increased actually to 3% to 6% over the restated 2011 numbers. We will give you details about 2013 outlook at the analyst meeting next month, as we do each year. But I can say that we still expect the rate of earnings growth in 2013 to improve over 2012. I am very excited about the opportunities ahead for Aflac. We remain focused on our vision to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance in the United States and the #1 provider of supplemental insurance in Japan. Now, I'll turn the program back over to Robin. Robin? Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Thanks, Dan. Let me briefly go through some first quarter numbers, starting with Aflac Japan. In terms of the top line, revenues, were up 7.8% and investment income was up 8.7%, benefiting from the receipt of a previously deferred coupon payment that was received as the results of the derisking activities in the first quarter. Our annualized persistency rate was strong at 94.5% compared with 94.3% in 2011. The benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year, going from 69.7% to 71.5%, primarily caused by the growth of net benefit reserves for ordinary life's line of products. The expense ratio was 18.1%, down from 18.7% a year ago, primarily impacted by lower net commissions associated with the sale of life products. As a result, the higher benefit ratio, the pretax margin declined from 22.3% in the quarter to 21.3%. Turning to Aflac U.S., total revenues rose 5.2% in the first quarter and the benefit ratio to total premiums increased slightly to 55.1% compared with 54.9% a year ago. The operating expense ratio decreased from 32.1% to 31.4% primarily due to lower advertising expenditures. Reflecting the decrease in the operating expense ratio, the profit margin for the quarter was 19.6% compared with 19.1% a year ago. Turning to some other items in the quarter. As you probably read in the press release, on January 1, 2012 we adopted revised accounting guidance for DAC. The retrospective adoption resulted in an after-tax cumulative charge to retained earnings of $408 million or 3.9% of adjusted shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2010 and had an immaterial impact on net income in 2011 and the preceding years. The increase in interest expense was primarily impacted by the borrowings during 2011 and the first quarter in 2012. Due to those borrowings, it helped also increase Parent Company [Audio Gap] the end of fourth quarter, which was $942 million versus $385 million at the end of 2011. Parent Company and other expenses increased to $20 million compared to $14 million in the first quarter of 2011, primarily caused by several items, including foreign exchange losses on yen-denominated cash at the inc [ph] level and other general operating expense increases associated with personnel and special projects. Total company operating margins decreased, reflecting the increase of the benefit ratio in Japan and caused by the increased sales of the ordinary life line of business. On our operating basis, the tax rate remained relatively unchanged at 34.7% and net earnings per diluted share for the quarter were $1.68 compared to $0.83 in 2011. As reported, our operating earnings per diluted share rose 7.4% to $1.74. As previously mentioned, our operating earnings benefited by the $23 million or $0.05 per share from the onetime receipt of the previously written-off deferred coupon. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.04 per diluted share, excluding the yen impact, operating earnings per share increased 4.9% for the quarter. Lastly, let me comment on the earnings outlook for 2012. The new accounting for DAC will impact earnings per share by approximately $0.05. We expect to produce operating earnings of $6.46 to $6.65 per diluted share on a constant currency basis. This range represents an increase of 3% to 6% over 2011. If the yen averages 80 to 85 for the full year, we would expect operating EPS to be in the area of $6.21 to $6.64 per diluted share. And for the second quarter, if the yen averages 80 to 85, we would expect operating earnings to be $1.53 to $1.59 per diluted share. I want to take this opportunity to remind all of you that our annual analyst meeting will be held in New York on May 15 and 16. There, we'll be able to provide you with further updates on our operations in both U.S. and Japan, along with our outlook for the coming year. Please register to attend. Now to be fair to everybody, we're going to start Q&A, but limit yourself to only one question and a follow- up related to that one question. Now, we'll be glad to take your questions."
197,GV_001449_2013Q1,"Presentation Operator Good morning, and welcome to Aflac First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Robin Wilkey, Senior Vice President of Aflac Investor and Rating Agency Relations. You may begin. Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of U.S. operations, Ken Janke, Executive Vice President and Deputy CFO; Eric Kirsch, Executive Vice President, Global Chief Investment Officer; and Toru Tonoike, President and COO of Aflac Japan, who is joining us from Tokyo. Before we start, let me remind you of some statements in this teleconference that are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Securities Law. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that they will prove to be accurate because they're prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those we discussed today. We encourage you to look at our quarterly release for some the various risk factors that could materially impact our results. Now I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will begin this morning with some comments about the quarter and our operations in Japan and the U.S. I'll then follow up with a few financial highlights for the first quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dan? Daniel Paul Amos Chairman, President & CEO Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm very pleased that we met, and in many cases, exceeded our financial and operational targets for the first quarter. Let me begin again with an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. New annualized premium sales in the first quarter were up 2.6% to JPY 53.8 billion. Revenues grew 9.7% and pretax earnings were up 10.7% for the quarter. Sales for the first set of products including WAYS and child endowment came in better than expected in the first quarter. This was primarily driven by consumers who wanted to make insurance purchases of per sector products ahead of the rate increase on April 2. I've said that I would not be surprised if we saw WAYS sales down 40% to 60% following the rate increase. Based on early sales indications for April, that seems like a reasonable estimate. Banks also had a strong sales push in order to end their fiscal year with solid sales results. Additionally, we've seen consumer show interest in a variety of investment-type products, especially with JGB yields at historic low rates and the Nikkei having risen considerably over the past several months. As such, we expect the sales of our first sector products, particularly WAYS, to be down significantly for the remainder of the year. With respect to total third sector products, combined cancer and medical insurance sales, we're down 7.1% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. However, remaining the leading provider of third-sector products is important to us and is the foundation of our product portfolio. We anticipate focusing more on third-sector product development now that deferred sector re-rating has been complete. We mentioned last year that we are currently underpenetrated in the consumers who are in their 20s to 40s. I'm pleased to tell you that we are working on getting approval of a new medical product with the FSA. As such, we anticipate very strong second half sales. Taking all these factors into account, I believe that 2013 expectation that Aflac Japan third sector, cancer and medical, will be flat to up 5% is still reasonable. Now let me turn to the U.S. operations. As I mentioned last quarter, I wouldn't be surprised if sales were down slightly in the first quarter, considering our biggest percentage increase last year came in the first quarter. Our results were consistent with that expectation. Aflac U.S. new annualized premium sales were down 5.2% for the quarter. We know that small employers are still guarded with respect to their business outlook. In addition, some employees have been reluctant to make changes in their benefits in advance of the Healthcare Reform implementation. In terms of relief of small businesses, if there is any recovery of all, it seems to be a jobless recovery. While there are several factors that we can't control, we are driven to improve the factors that we can influence. We continue to expand our marketing activities to maximize our future growth. With brand recognition at 94%, we continue to leverage our popularity to capture the attention of the consumers with the ultimate goal of driving sales. I hope you've seen our newest commercials that portrays the Aflac Duck as the policy holder and claimant. They have been very popular. We want to continue to educate consumers about our products, while at the same time entertaining them. Additionally, we evaluate and enhance our products to ensure that we are in step with the needs of the consumers, particularly in this economic landscape. We are also planning some aggressive new individual and group product launches. With a strong brand recognition and reputation for paying claims quickly and fairly, we believe consumers will be more receptive to purchasing our products. As you know, a lot of changes are taking place in the U.S. health care environment and we expect these changes to impact how people choose to purchase insurance going forward. We are spending a great deal of time ensuring that we are prepared to approach this change from a position of strength. Our job is to be multifaceted in our distribution, to make sure we have the presence where the consumer wants to purchase the products. There are different distribution possibilities we're working on, from creating a private exchange to expanding our reach through insurance brokers, to empowering our individual agents. One thing we know from nearly 4 decades in Japan, is that even with national health care systems, consumers have significant out-of-pocket expenses, and our products continue to be relevant in their needs. Although there will be more competition, we believe the national health care system in the U.S. actually presents Aflac with opportunities as consumers become more aware of financial protection Aflac products help provide. As I mentioned, first quarter sales comparisons are the most challenging of the year. We expect sales to be weighted more toward the latter half of the year. We believe it's reasonable to expect Aflac U.S. sales to our traditional and broker channels to be flat to up 5% throughout the year. Having discussed our operations, let me give you an update on the investment function. We made excellent progress in the build out of our investment team and the implementation of our investment strategy. I am pleased we did not have any major investment losses in the first quarter. While we still view Europe as an area of investment risk, I believe our portfolio is better positioned than ever to accommodate market volatility in the future. Also, we're optimistic in the future derisking of our portfolio, including the sale of 25% of our Tunisian bond holdings. As we have stated for many years, our greatest investment challenge has been to invest Aflac's significant cash flow at reasonable investment yields. The U.S. corporate bond program initiated in July of last year continues to be an effective means for enhancing Aflac Japan's new money yields. In addition to the attractive returns, we are pleased with the positive impact to our overall portfolio of quality and liquidity. For the past 2 quarters, we have invested roughly 2/3 of our investment cash flows in U.S. denominated, publicly traded corporate bonds, and then hedged to currency risk. At March 31, this program represented 8.7% of our total portfolio, which is well below our strategic asset allocation range. Additionally, as part of our investment strategy, we said we would invest about 1/3 of our cash flow in JGBs. However, with 10-year JGB yields hitting historic lows, we want to be flexible in our asset allocation. We anticipate that the Bank of Japan will keep interest rates low for the immediate future. Our investment team is carefully monitoring Japan's monetary and fiscal policy, as we have seen significant changes impacting financial markets, including Japan interest rates and yen-dollar exchange rates. We are evaluating our investment options and looking for alternatives to lower our planned JGB new money investment allocation. We will consider diversification and liquidity as we approach these investment choices. As I mentioned, Aflac's consolidated financial performance was extremely strong for the quarter. Excluding the impact from foreign currency, operating earnings per diluted share rose 5.7% for the quarter. I was also very pleased with the increasing strength of capital ratios, which demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength and flexibility on behalf of our policyholders, shareholders and bondholders. While we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements, we estimate our quarterly RBC ratio at March 31 was above our 2012 year-end ratio of 630%. We believe Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio at March 31 will also improve over the year-end 2012 level of 669%. As we have communicated, given the capital structure, our ability to repurchase shares is largely tied to profit repatriation. In contemplating profit repatriation, our first consideration is the safety of the policyholders, as measured by the SMR. Next, we consider the needs of the parent company and consult with Japan's management in making the determination. We currently expect 2013 profit repatriation to be a bit higher than the JPY 50 billion we communicated last quarter. This assumes we have no additional material investment losses between now and mid-June when we file Aflac Japan's FSA-based financial statements. As we have said for many years, when it comes to deploying capital, we still believe to growing cash dividend and repurchasing our shares are the most attractive means, and those are the avenues we will continue to pursue. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate that is in line with earnings per share growth before the impact of the yen. We have a lot of flexibility at the parent company in terms of liquidity. Given the liquidity and the strength of our capital ratios, we plan to purchase $400 million to $600 million of our shares in 2013. We are already off to a great start with our share repurchase plans for the year. In the first quarter, we purchased approximately 3 million shares or about $150 million. I think this shows that we're even more comfortable with this range. Additionally, we expect to accelerate our share repurchase in 2014. Maintaining strong capital levels remains a priority for us, at the same time generating an industry- leading return on equity, excluding the yen impact, is also extremely important to us and to our owners. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee of the Aflac's Board of Directors made a decision to include operating ROE as a component of the bonus of Aflac's senior management effective this year. On an operating basis, our first quarter ROE was 23.4%. Keep in mind, our ROE is sensitive to currency fluctuations because we have largely hedged equity into dollars, but not all of our earnings. This means when the yen weakens, our ROE declines. Had the yen remained unchanged since the end of the year, our operating ROE would have been 26.1%. So even with the weaker yen, I think it's still reasonable to expect our operating ROE to range between 20% and 25% for 2013. In yesterday's release, we have reaffirmed our 2013 guidance of 4% to 7% increase in operating earnings per share, excluding the impact of currency. This range reflects the impact of investing significant cash flows at historically low interest rates. I would also remind you that our 2012 earnings were better than expected. Although the yen is significantly weaker to the dollar, the fundamentals of our business and our operations are strong. Overall, I am pleased with Aflac's position in Japan and the United States, the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. And first and foremost, we are focused on protecting our policyholders and providing value to our investors. We are fortunate that in the process of doing so, we have the privilege of providing financial protection to more than 50 million people worldwide. Now I'll turn the program over to Robin. Robin Y. Wilkey Senior Vice President, Investor & Rating Agency Relations Thanks, Dan. Let me go through some first quarter numbers starting with Aflac Japan. Beginning with top line, revenues were up 9.7% for the quarter. Excluding the effect of the weaker yen in the quarter, revenues were up 8.4%. The annualized persistency rate, excluding annuities in the quarter, was strong at 95.0% compared with 94.5% last year. Net investment income increased 7.3%. Excluding the benefit of the weaker yen in the quarter on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, net investment income rose 1.2%. In terms of quarterly operating ratio, the benefit ratio to total premiums increased over last year going from 71.5% a year ago to 72.4% in the first quarter, primarily caused by the growth of the net benefit reserves for our ordinary life line of products, most notably WAYS. The expense ratio for the quarter was 17.1%, down from 18.1% a year ago. The expense ratio was impacted primarily by lower net commissions associated with the sale of the life product lines. As a result of the lower expense ratio, the pretax profit margin rose slightly from 21.3% to 21.5% in the quarter. Turning to Aflac U.S. Total revenues rose 3.9% in the first quarter. The benefit ratio to total premiums decreased over last year, going from 55.1% a year ago to 54% in the first quarter. This was generally in line with normal seasonality effects during the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the first 3 months was strong but stable at 74.7%. No change from last year's results. The expense ratio for the quarter was up 32.5%, up from 31.4% a year ago and is in line with normal first quarter activity. The profit margin for the quarter was relatively unchanged at 19.5% compared to 19.6% a year ago. Turning to some investment activity for the quarter, starting with Aflac Japan. Approximately $1.8 billion of Aflac Japan's new cash flow was invested in the corporate bond program for gross yield of 3.72%, and at annualized hedge cost of 30 basis points. The yield net of hedging cost was 3.42%. This brings the total cash flow invested in the corporate bond program to approximately $8.8 billion, with the total yield on the corporate bond program of 3.41% excluding hedge cost. Approximately 30% of our new cash flow for the quarter was invested in JGBs with an average yield of 1.53%. The new money yield for the quarter, all in, was 3.03%, an increase of 30 basis points from the fourth quarter and up 100 basis points from a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of March was up 3.01%, up 14 basis points from the fourth quarter, and 17 basis points lower than a year ago. In terms of U.S. investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 3.69%, an increase of 17 basis points from the fourth quarter and the yield on portfolio at the end of March was 6.19%, down 16 basis points from the fourth quarter and 42 basis points from a year ago. Turning to some other items in the quarter. Non-insurance interest expense was $48 million compared to $44 million a year ago. On an operating basis, the tax rate decreased from 34.7% a year ago to 34.4%. The weaker yen decreased operating earnings by $0.15 per diluted share for the quarter. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share increased 5.7% for the quarter. Operating ROE as reported for the quarter was 23.4%. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating ROE for the quarter was 26.1%. As you heard Dan mentioned earlier, we plan to repatriate more than JPY 50 billion in 2013. In anticipation of our profit repatriation this year and considering the current market conditions, we've entered into derivative contracts to hedge the majority of our profit repatriation this year against the potential further weakening of the yen. Also, as part of a continual refinement in our pricing methodology for our investment portfolio, where we have a large number of privately issued securities, we have elected to move from an internal modeling method for assessment and valuation of these securities to an outside vendor. As a result of this change in market conditions during the quarter, shareholders equity declined by approximately $582 million from December 31. Lastly, let me comment on our earnings outlook for 2013 and our upcoming Analyst Meeting. You heard  us affirm our objective to increase operating EPS, 4% to 7% this year excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 95 to 100 for the full year, we would expect to report operating EPS of $5.99 to $6.37 per diluted share for the full year. For the second quarter, using the same currency assumptions, we would expect operating earnings to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.56 per diluted share. Now let me take a few moments to remind you that our Annual Analyst Meeting will be held in New York on May 22. We've given careful consideration and thought to our policy of providing earnings guidance at the Analyst Meeting. As we look at our disclosure practices, we've made a modification to the way we will discuss our earnings targets. We conclude that it is in the best interest of our company and our shareholders to provide earnings guidance in the third quarter for the following year, rather than projecting earnings 1.5 years out as we previously done over the past several years. We do not expect earnings growth to be materially different in what we see for 2013. We simply feel that it's better for us to take the additional 5 months to gather more data that influences our business before we put out an estimate. This will also more closely align our financial modeling with our budgeting process. So at the Analyst Meeting next month, we won't comment on 2014 earnings expectations. However, we will discuss our operations in great detail and update you on opportunities to grow our business in 2014 and beyond. Please don't forget to register if you'd like to attend. And now we'll get back to this quarter and we'd be happy to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] We may begin."
198,GV_001449_2008Q2,"Presentation Operator Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect this time. Now I'll turn the meeting over to Ken Janke, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Kenneth S. Janke Jr. Thank you. Good morning, everybody and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me this morning is Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO; Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO; Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of our U.S. Operations; Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer. Also from Japan, we are joined by Tohru Tonoike who is President and COO of Aflac, Japan and with him is Takaaki Matsumoto and Hisayuki Shinkai. You know that Matsumoto's son is in charge of sales, Shinkai's son is charge of banks and Charles Lake, the Chairman of Aflac Japan is also with him. Before we start, let me refer you to the Safe Harbor language. I would like to point out that some of the statements in this conference call this morning are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Securities Laws, although we believe these statements are reasonable. We can give you no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are prospective in nature. Actual results could differ materially from those that we discuss today. I encourage you to look at our quarterly press release for some of various risk factors that could materially impact our future results. Now, I'll turn the program over to Dan, who will talk about our quarter and outlook for the balance of the year in the United States and Japan. I will follow up with some financial highlights and then we would be happy to take your questions. Dan? Daniel P. Amos Thanks, Ken. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start out by saying that I remain pleased with Aflac's financial performance. Our financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2008 met or exceeded our expectations in both the United States and Japan. However from a sales perspective, I had expected Japan's, Aflac Japan's sales to produce better growth in the quarter, but I still believe that we can achieve our sales objective for the year. Most important, I continue to believe we are well positioned to achieve our objective for operating earnings per share for this year and 2009. Let me share some more thoughts about the quarter beginning without Aflac, Japan. It's the leading contributor to our consolidated financial statement, we were very satisfied with Alfa Japan's operating results in second quarter of 2008. Our top line was consistent with our budget for the year and the benefit ratio continued to improve as we expected. The persistency of our business was strong and we again produced solid pre-tax earnings growth. You may remember from the first quarter comments that we anticipated slower sales growth in the second quarter compared with Aflac Japan's 5% increase in the first quarter. In part that was because I knew how aggressively Aflac Japan pushed at the end of March. I felt that they had written some business in the first quarter that would otherwise occurred in the second quarter. Even though I believe second quarter sales results would be slower than the first quarter, I did not think we would have positive sales results. Instead, total new annualized premium sales declined 4.9% to 28.7 billion yen in the quarter. For the first six months new sales were $56.3 billion or 0.3% below the first half of 2007. One of the reasons for the sales decline was weaker cancer insurance sales than we anticipated. Cancer insurance sales in the second quarter of 2007 exceeded 10.8 billion yen and were the strongest that we have seen in a longtime. You may recall that cancer insurance sales a year ago benefited from a rush to purchase the product before the premium rate increase took effect. So we knew we were going be up against tough compressions. In addition our agents have been aggressively focused on selling our lower premium cancer upgrade product since March of this year. This separate policy bridge the coverage from the old product and our new Cancer Forte type product with daily out patient benefit and annuity for newly diagnoses patients and canceling in doctor referral benefits. This cancer upgrade policy has allowed us to leverage our policy holder base to increase sales. In the second quarter, we sold 94,500 of these upgrade policies. However, the average premium was much lower at 27,000 yen compared with the Cancer Forte average premium of about 50,500 yen per policy. We now realize, we must go back and concentrate on selling Cancer Forte, rather than upgrade policies which we will do. The good news is that the medical sales were up 8.7% for the second quarter and 13% for the first six months. Medical sales have benefited from Gentle EVER, our non standard medical product that we begin selling in August of 2007. Gentle EVER contributed 1.2 billion yen in sales or approximately 13% of the medial sales in the quarter. While we know this product appeals to a relatively narrow segment of the population, we've been pleased with the opportunity to extend our reach to new consumers and further segment the market for medical insurance. It's certainly been one component in our medical sales recovery. We continue to believe that sales of cancer and medical insurance will benefit from the new distribution channel, and we remain encouraged about the opportunities to sell through a significant number of banks in Japan. By the end of June, Aflac had already secured agreements with 154 banks to sell our products out of a total of 402 banks. That's a much greater number of selling agreements than our competitors, and it's more than we initially expected. In the second quarter, we sold 680 million yen in new business through the bank channel which is a 146.4% increase over the first quarter. In fact, June sales through the bank channel were greater than the entire first quarter. Although that's the tremendous increase over the first quarter Bank sales, we'd expected sales from the Bank channel to do even better. We believe slower than expected growth to this new channel primarily reflects the ongoing conservatism of some banks due to the regulatory environment. We're still very excited about the prospects of bank sales, because banks that have been introduced to our products are doing very well. In addition, we will begin selling the product through the bank channel in October. Also in response to the needs of banks, we developed a single premium product called which has been approved for the sales on this product called Santiso [ph] which has been approved for the sale by the FSA. This product provides lump sum payments upon the diagnosis of cancer, heart attack or stroke. It also has debt benefits. In addition, we have are very pleased that the national association of Shinkin banks has endorsed our Gentle EVER and weighs products to the membership of the 280 Shinkin banks. As I've said before, I believe bank sales in the fourth quarter should be 10 times the amount we rote in the first quarter. I still believe that's the case, and I expect the momentum in the bank channels to build in 2009 as well. Overall, we are confident in this channel and fully expect it to meet out long-term expectations. We're also looking forward to the opportunities to sell Cancer Forte products through our agreement with Japan Post Network. As I am sure you are aware where Japan Bus chose Aflac as the cancer insurance provider through their network company. Initially, we expected to sale through about 300 postal outlets almost... also beginning on October the first of this year. Next month, we will begin training 5000 Japan post workers. Needles to say, we continue to believe this is a great opportunity for both Japan Post and Aflac. I am sure most of you are aware that the FSA's recent issues of the business improvement order to the top 10 Japanese life insurance companies. We were very surprised and disappointed to receive an order, even though they are common. The order requires the company to enhance the process and then to report on the progress to the FSA. We took exception to the business improvement order because we believe it was unfair and unjust. We feel this for several reasons. First, Aflac Japan was one of few companies able to complete the five year claims review process by the date... deadline required by the FSA. Second, our average rate was low compared with others in the industry. During the five year review period we assessed more than 4.2 million benefit payments and determined that our average rate was 0.47%, which means that 99.53 of the benefits were paid properly. Since then we have lowered the average rate by half and we expect it to get even lower. Third, we are in close contact with the FSA throughout the process and completed all promised measures on schedule to correct the problem and to prevent reoccurrence. In our opinion it appears that in issuing the business improvement order, the FSA focused on the absolute number of cases and the overall yen amount associated with those cases, rather the considering the companies real average rate. On a positive side there was limited media coverage of the business improvement order and we do not expect any material impact on the business. Perhaps and most importantly this should now put the claims issue behind the industry Our marketing team in Japan has plans in place and all of Japan's offices or all of part of their bonus is tied to achieving 3 to 7% increases in sales for the year. Although our sales objective for the year is going to be more challenging then we initially thought, I believe we will achieve it. Now let me turn to our business in the United States, the top line of Aflac U.S. was consistent with the expectations and pre-tax earnings were better than our target. We were also pleased to see an improvement in persistency over the first quarter. Total new annualized premium sales were up 4.9% to 383 million. Although sales were below our annual target rate of 8% to 12% for the second quarter. I was encouraged to see a significant improvement following a very weak first quarter. For the first six months, total new annualized premium sales increased 2.6% to 736 million. We continue to be pleased with expansion our sales force. New age of recruitment has been solid this year and the second quarter we recruited more than 6700 new associates an increase of 4.2% for the six months recruits were up 6.3%. The average number of weekly producing sales associates also increased 6.3% in the second quarter after being up only 0.2% in the first quarter. We believe our success in increasing the number of producing sales associates has resulted from an enhanced training program and we've been implementing over the last few years. In addition to growth of our sales force the key indicators we used to measure our sales force activities continues to be very positive. For example the number of new payroll accounts rose 10.1% in the second quarter, following, an 8.5% increase in the first quarter. The growth of payroll accounts opened by new agents rose a very strong 20.3% in the second quarter. Production from new associates was also very positive, rising 12% in the second quarter. That leads us to believe that the fundamental approach to building and training an affective distribution team is still working and we continued it to be our main focus. I believe our strong payroll account growth suggest that employers are better understanding the benefits, Aflac brings to the table. They are seeing how Aflac's product help to provide health care options to there workers at an affordable price. We believe the improved acceptance of employers has benefited from the advertising message and also the new business to business initiatives; we discussed that the annuals meeting in May. And we are looking at the consumers buying pattern. The average revenue was premium per new customer is up for the first half of this year compared with the year ago. However during the same period, fewer employees took out coverage when we enrolled the new pay roll account, which is a problem and we are addressing it through better training. The obvious question is whether our new sales have been impacted by the slower economy. I think it's very safe to assume that some of our policy holders, potential customers and sales associates are feeling the pain of the current environment. Obviously we have operated in the challenging economics before. But it's been a long time since consumers have added deal with such short increases in gasoline and food prices. However, we don't believe this means that our fortunes are exclusively tied to the business cycle. As you've heard me say before, I believe the need for our products is actually more compelling when the economy weakens, because the financial risk to the household becomes more pronounced. The risks of serious illness or accidents don't change with the business cycle. But coping with rising household expenses, even more of a drain on the family's finances when a healthcare occur... event occurs. That's exactly where our products can provide value to the average American household. In this environment, it's up to us to understand the circumstances that existing and potential customers are facing and make sure that our message is appropriate and our products are affordable. We now that people don't wake up in the morning, and suddenly come to the realization that they need an extra layer of protection, especially in this challenging economy. It's our job to identify potential customers and inform them of the possible risk and then help mitigate those risks through the sale our products. You will recall that we held a national training day for our field force in the first quarter to intensify and coordinate our message in this current economy. One of the adjectives of that day was to train our sales force on how to sell our products in a weak economy. We have incorporated that message into our ongoing field training. Earlier this month, we released a commercial that speaks directly to the challenges consumers face and why Aflac's products are important in this type economy. We're doing what we believe is appropriate to support our sales force and customizing our training and tools to suit the current needs. While the weak economy, would have made it more challenging to sell, it's actually made it easier to recruit. The reason is that when unemployment people cannot find salary jobs, they are willing to try commissions that they normally would have not done. As I mentioned in the press release, it will clearly be difficult to achieve the minimum of 8% for this year when we need 12.5% for the second half. However, I can assure you that our sales director and eight territory directors are all pushing hard to improve the sales result so they can make a bonus. Importantly, we continue to believe that the U.S. market is perfectly suited to our business. There are literally millions of potential payroll accounts and tens on millions of potential customers that can benefit from our products. On a consolidated basis, I'm pleased with our overall financial position. Clearly there's been a lot of investor focused on the balance sheet of financial companies recently, which is certainly something that we understand. I'm proud that Aflac's balance sheet was marked by highly rated investments. Despite the turmoil of the capital markets, we are confident that our time tested investment approach remains prudent and effective in the current environment. Even though we have seen a sharp rise in unrealized losses on the fixed income investments, they have primarily resulted from the widening of credits for it. Remember, that a widening of spreads benefits our income statement as we invest huge cash flows in Japan at a more attractive investment yields. Our outlook for this year remains 14% to 15% increase in operating per diluted share, before the effect of foreign currency. I have a high degree of confidence that we can achieve that target and we hope to grow with a high end of the range this year. As I mentioned in our analyst meeting in May, our modeling suggest that 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share excluding the currency is reasonable goal for 2009. I am still focused on increasing operating earnings per share by at least 15% excluding the impact of through yen from my first 20 years of Chief Executive Officer. Beyond those 20 years, I still think we can produce another ten years of double-digit earnings growth. As we look to the future, we believe our strong earnings growth will continue to exemplify our underlying earnings tower of our insurance operations in the United States and Japan. It will also reflect our prudent approach to deploying access capital in way that benefits our shareholders. Ken? C: Kenneth S. Janke Jr.: Well thank you Dan. Let me just briefly go through some of the second quarter numbers beginning with Aflac Japan. Starting at the top line in yen terms, of revenues were 2.9% for the quarter. Investment income was down 0.7%, due primarily the impact of stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar denominated investment income. If you exclude the effect of the stronger yen, investment income was actually up 5% on a currency neutral basis. Of the annualized persistency rate excluding the annuities was 94.5% compared with 94.7 in the first half of 2007, that was consistent with our expectation. In terms of quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over last year. It was 61.9% in the quarter compared with 63.7% a year ago and excluding the impact from the weaker excuse me, the stronger Yen on investment income the benefit ratio was 61.5%. The expense ratio for the quarter was 19.9%, up from 18.9 in 2007. The higher expense ratio was budgeted and therefore expected and the increase primarily reflected additional marketing expenses, especially for ongoing preparation on the bank channel and increased IT expenses. Reflecting the lower benefit ratio and the higher expense ratio, the margin rows from 17.4% to 18.2% in the quarter. With the expansion of the margin, free cash, earnings were up 7.5% for the quarter in Yen and again excluding the impact of the stronger Yen-on-dollar denominated investment income, pre tax earnings were up 11.1% in the quarter. On the investment side, yields in Japan were a bit higher than they were in the first quarter. For instance, looking at the index of 20 year JGB's, the yields averaged 2.24% in the second quarter, up from 2.08% in the first quarter. The compounded yield for 20 year JGB right now is about 2.26%. For the quarter invested our cash flow in Yen securities at an average rate of 3.27%, including dollars the blended rate was 3.46%. Our portfolio yield at the end of June was 398, that's down 1 basis point from the end of March and 11 basis points lower that a year ago. The overall credit quality of the portfolio remains very high. On a consolidated basis securities rated double BB or lower are only 1.9% if the end of June, which was unchanged since the end of March. We did have one small addition to our below investment credit holdings in the quarter that was Sprint Capital Corp. That was down grade and had an amortized cost of $24 million. Turing the Aflac U.S., total revenues were up 8.4% in the quarter. The annualized persistency rate for the six months was 73.1% which was up significantly from the first quarter and only down slightly from a year ago. Looking at the operating ratios for the Aflac U.S., the benefit ratio was 52.8% in the quarter, compared with 53.1% a year ago. The expense ratio was unchanged at 31.3, therefore the profit margin increased to 15.9% compared with 15.6 a year ago. As a result pre-tax operating earnings for Aflac U.S. were up 11.1% in the quarter. In terms of U.S. investments the new money yield for the quarter was 729, up from 651 a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June was 7.04%, up 3 basis points from the first quarter in the year ago. Looking at some other line items for the quarter, excluding FAS 115, the ratio of debts to total capital was 15.9% at the end of June, a little change from the 16.0% of a year ago. Non insurance interest expense in the quarter was $6 million, compared to $5 million a year ago. In the company and another unallocated expenses, were $11 million in the quarter, up from $5 million a year ago. That increase primarily reflected a reduction in retirement expense in 2007 and then lower investment income in 2008 at the parent company level. On a consolidated basis that pre-tax operating profit margin rose from 16.6% to 17.2%. The after tax margin also increased, rising from 10.9% to 11.2%. The tax rate, as we expected was little changed, and was 34.7 versus 34.6 a year ago. As reported, operating earnings per diluted share rose 23.2% to a $1 that was consistent with the guidance we had given on our first quarter call. The stronger Yen increased operating earnings by $0.08 per share in the quarter and $.013 for the first six months of the year. So excluding the Yen's impact, operating earnings per share were up 13.4% for both the quarter and the first six months. Lastly let me comment on the outlook for the year. AS Dan mentioned we have reaffirmed our target of 14 to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, before the impact of the Yen for 2008. That would translate to a target of $3.73 to $3.76, assuming the exact same average exchange rate as we experienced in 2007. However, as you now the yen is clearly much stronger than it was a year ago. And if the yen is averages 105 to 110 for the full year, we would expect reported earnings per share to be $3.86 to $3.98 on a diluted basis for 2008. Under that same yen scenario, third quarter operating earnings per share would likely be $0.98 to $1.01 per diluted share. The first call estimate this morning was a $1.01. For 2009, our objective is a 13 to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact at the yen. We would like to make sure that everyone has a chance to ask a question this morning, so please let limit yourself to one question, so that we can be faired everyone and we'll try to give back with you if you have additional questions. Christine, we'd now be happy open it up and take some questions. Question And Answer"
199,GV_001449_2009Q2,"Presentation Operator Welcome to the Aflac second quarter Earnings Call. Your lines have been placed on listen-only until the question-and-answer session. Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ken Janke, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ken Janke Thank you, Don. Good morning, everybody and thanks for joining us this morning. With me at Aflac are Dan Amos, Chairman and CEO, Kriss Cloninger, President and CFO, Paul Amos, President of Aflac and COO of our US Operations, Jerry Jeffery, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer and Tohru Tonoike, who is President and COO of Aflac Japan, joins us from Tokyo. Before we begin this morning, let me remind you that some of the statements in this teleconference are forward-looking within the meaning of Federal Securities Laws. Although we believe these statements are reasonable, we can give you no assurance they will prove to be accurate because they are perspective in nature. Our actual results in the future could differ materially from those that we discussed today. I'd encourage you to look at the press release we released last night, and the various risk factors that could influence our future results. Now, let me turn the program over to Dan, who will have some comments about the quarter and the outlook for Japan and the United States. I'll follow up with some financials and then we'd be pleased to take your questions. Dan? Dan Amos Thank you, Ken. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I hope you had a chance to look at our second quarter press release. I'll be commenting on the operations in Japan and the United States, but first I'd like to talk about the financial results and our balance sheet. As I hope you noted, we had a strong quarter from an operational earnings perspective. Operating earnings were $1.20 diluted share, up 18.8% over the second quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating earnings per share rose 13.9% for the quarter and 14.6 for the six months. These results put us in a great position to achieve our annual objective of a 13% to 15% growth before the effect of foreign currency. Net earnings in the second quarter were influenced by realized investment losses. We sold our holdings of CIT in July, and recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter reflecting the sales price. In addition, we impaired the dated Upper Tier 2 securities of Communal Credit in the quarter. This Australian bank is in the process of restructuring and following the additional credit analysis, we concluded that the restructuring would decrease the likelihood we would receive the entire principal amount when the securities reached their maturities. We also impaired some perpetual securities we owned because they were classified below investment grade. The after-tax impairment charge of $93 million was determined using the equity impairment approach under the General Accepted Accounting Principles. The impairment of the perpetual securities did not affect our statutory financial statements, and we continue to believe that we will receive the interest in the principal payments that are contractually due. Just as we did in the first quarter, let me update you on the impairment outlook for the perpetual holdings. Assuming the yen/dollar exchange rate and the pricing of the perpetual securities remain unchanged from June 30s levels, and no additional downgrades to below investment grade, then we expect to book $265 million of impairments in the third quarter, and $109 million in the fourth quarter under the equity impairment method. However, I want to remind you of two important points. First, these charges will not impact GAAP shareholders equity, because all the perpetual securities are already characterized as available for sale and carried to market of a balance sheet. Second and most important, we would not be required to record comparable impairment charges per statutory accounting purposes. Even with the realized investment losses in the second quarter, our risk-based capital ratio remains high. As you saw in our press release, we estimate that the RBC ratio was 459% at the end of June. The decline since the end of March primarily reflected the affect of downgrades on the required capital. I realize that many of you have been following the rating agency's actions with respect to perpetual for or so-called 'hybrids', and have wondered what impact further downgrades might have on our RBC ratio. If we assume all of the perpetual holdings were rated below investment grade at June 30, our RBC ratio would still have exceeded our internal target. We do not think this scenario is likely, however, we believe this type of stress testing helps demonstrate that our capital position is strong enough to tolerate significant down downgrades raids in our portfolio should they arise. I know that many of you are aware of Banco Santander recently announced an exchange offer that included Abbey National perpetual securities we own. As we have done with previous offers, we closely evaluate the economics of the exchange offer. In this particular case, we concluded it was not in the best interests to participate in the exchange. Banco Santander is a strong European financial institution, and we expect the bank to continue to make coupon payments on Abbey National securities. When they announced its exchange, it also commented that further redemptions will be made on a purely economic basis. I'd like to point out that the first redemption date on Abbey National perpetuals we hold is not until January of 2015. It's certainly possible that five and half years from now, it will be in their best interests to redeem the securities. Actually, we do not have any significant short-term extension risk among our perpetual investments. For the balance of this year, we only have 163 million of perpetual securities that become eligible for redemption. We have just $104 million of perpetual securities with redemption dates of 2010. As we've previously discussed, we have two issues that were redeemed earlier this year, although Deutsche Bank did not redeem a Tier One perpetual in late June. The book value of that security is only $16 million, and more importantly, Deutsche Bank remains current on the interest payments. I think it's noteworthy that we have only one issuer who deferred the payment this year. Overall, I remain confident in the quality of the investments we hold, and the strength of our capital position. Now, let me give you a brief update on the operations beginning with Aflac Japan. Aflac Japan performed well from an operational and financial perspective in the second quarter. We were particularly encouraged by the sales results. Total new annualized premium sales in yen were up 5% for the quarter. For the first six months, total new sales were up 2.3%. We believe these results solidly positioned us to achieve our goal of flat to a 5% increase this year. Second quarter sales increase primarily reflected a favorable consumer response to the introduction of a new child endowment product we believe that we discussed at the analyst meeting in May. The strong initial sales of this new product significantly contributed to a 38.7% increase in ordinary life sales in the category. During the quarter, we sold 17,900 child endowment policies, at an average premium of JPY143,900. Although the child endowment product has a lower margin than our health insurance products, its margins significantly exceed the margins of the fixed annuity coverage that we offer. Furthermore, we believe the profit margin is reasonable, particularly given the fact that it is viewed as the best child endowment product in the market today. As we discussed at the analyst meeting, we believe the child endowment product as well as other life products called [GIFT] have potential to open doors for our third sector. In that regard, 15% of the individuals who purchased our child endowment plan from its introduction in March through June also purchased at least one of our other products. Offering new first sector products allows us to package the product with the cancer and medical products at the same time, it also gives us an opportunity to cross sell at a later date. We were very pleased to see continued improvement in the bank channels in the second quarter, with a 39% increase over the first quarter. Compared with a year ago though, bank channel sales were up 106%. At the end of June, a total number of 346 banks represented Aflac Japan. Of that amount, 275 have been selling Aflac Japan's core products like cancer and medical, since the full deregulation of sales through banks in December of 2007. We continue to have a significantly greater number of banks selling for us than any other insurer operating in Japan. We expect continued improvement in the bank channel sales through the remainder of this year and next. As you know, we began selling our market leading cancer insurance on a limited basis through Japan Post Network Co. beginning last October. Effective July 1 of this year, the number of post offices selling our products increased from 300 to 1,000. Prior to this expansion, we've trained the personnel of an additional 700 outlets. On July 14, we announced we will begin introducing a revised 'EVER' product on August 21. This will be the first major revision that we have made to our popular medical product since its introduction in 2002. The most notable change is the enhanced surgical benefit. In addition, the revised EVER premiums will be gender specific. Rates for female buyers will be lower than the original version of EVER at most issue ages, while male purchasers would generally pay less at younger ages and more at older ages. I want to emphasize that the expected profit margins for this product are comparable to our original EVER profit; and we think the revision benefits and premium structures will be well received by agents and consumers. We preannounced the new product to provide our agencies with adequate amount of time to prepare for solicitation of large accounts. While this approach accommodates our enrollments, it also means that we expect some slowdown in medical sales between the announcement date, and the introduction date, as the sales force and potential customers wait for the new product. As a result, our sales growth in the third quarter will likely be in line with the first quarter, but we anticipate a solid increase in the fourth quarter as the new medical product is rolled out. As I mentioned, we believe we can achieve our sales objective in 2009 despite the current economic conditions. As we look ahead, we are convinced that Japan remains a strong market for our type of products. Turning to our operation in the United States, we were not surprised that Aflac US was again challenged to generate sales momentum amid the difficult economic backdrop. During the second quarter, total annualized premium sales were down 10.9%, and for the six months lower than a year ago. Based on our sales results of the first half of the year, it is unlikely we will achieve our sales objective of flat to 5% increase for the full year. As we assumed in our financial projections for this year, the persistency rate for the US business declined compared to a year ago, but it improved over the first quarter of 2009. This means that we did not see any further sequential deterioration in the persistency of our business. Our second quarter persistency was fairly consistent with our planned assumption. While a very weak economic environment has continued to impact sales, we remain encouraged by the basic sales-related activities of our US operation. The current labor market has provided a good opportunity for expanding our commissioned sales force because salaried jobs are harder to come by. In the second quarter, recruitment of new agents was up 14.9% to 7,800 new sales associates, and 19.9% higher for the first half of the year. The average number of weekly producing sales associates was down 2.6% during the second quarter. However, the average number of new weekly producers rose 6.1% in the quarter. We believe that suggests the training enhancements we've implemented over the last few years have been taking hold. Like the first quarter, new payroll account sales were strong, rising 9.6% over the second quarter of 2008 and payroll accounts opened by new agents was up 19.9% or almost 20%. As you read in our release, we will be acquiring Continental American Insurance Company or CAIC in the fourth quarter for $100 million, which is approximately $67 million in excess of its year-end 2008 statutory capital and surplus. CAIC is a specialty insurer that focuses on selling voluntary group products at the worksite through broker distribution. CAIC is a profit-focused operator with margins that are consistent with our expectation. The company is strongly capitalized and its RBC ratio is 569% at the end of 2008. In fact, in June, CAIC was upgraded by A. M. Best to an (A-) or Excellent, which is a significant accomplishment in this environment. The reason for this purchase is very straightforward. For the last two years, we've been in discussions with broker distribution as one of the high priority initiatives in the United States. In pursuing this initiative, it became clear that some brokers preferred to offer group products rather than those that are individually underwritten. To meet the product needs of the field force pursuing larger accounts, and the brokers, we evaluated our options. We could build the capacity ourselves, partner with another company or purchase the expertise. We concluded that it made the most sense to purchase the scalable platform. After identifying and assessing many potential candidates, we determined that CAIC was clearly the best fit. We believe this purchase will send a clear message to brokers that we're serious about doing business in this market. Equally important, it will be helpful to our sales agents by providing yet another entry point that opens the door to large accounts. I want to emphasize that this purchase does not signal a shift in our strategy. We are still focused on growing internally and not through acquisitions. However, by purchasing this group platform, our industry- leading field force will be equipped to take advantage of the vast opportunities in the US market. We continue to work on marketing and administrative integration plans over the next few months as we prepare for 2010. Although it's too early to project the impact the acquisition will have on the US sales, we will be assessing the sales opportunities in the coming months, and our 2010 sales projection will reflect the combined outlook of Aflac and CAIC. We expect this purchase will be slightly accretive to next year's consolidated earnings after expected integration costs. At a time when our financial businesses may be evaluating the viability of the business model, we have the financial strength to invest and build on Aflac's already strong business model. With the long term we see in the United States, we believe this is the right time to invest in this vast market. Despite weak economic conditions, our earnings outlook has not changed. Our objective remains 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share in 2009, excluding the impact of yen. For 2010, our objective is a 9% to 12% increase in operated earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen/dollar exchange. However, I want to remind you that my number one priority is to maintain a strong capital position. As you know, we issued $850 million of 10-year senior notes in May to assist in the refinancing of our 10- year senior notes we paid-off on April 15 of 2009. Simultaneously, we were also working on securing some private sources of yen denominated debt to broaden our source of debt financing. On July 21 of 2009, we signed an agreement to borrow JPY10 billion or around 105 million from a leading Japanese financial institution at an interest rate of 3.6% for a term of six years. We're also in negotiations to secure an additional $5 billion from another source that we expect to complete in the near future. We intend to apply these proceeds to the repayment of the next maturing date obligation which is July of 2010. We believe that successful conclusion of these financing activities, which will raise approximately a billion in total well positions our capital structure for the foreseeable future. Overall, I believe Aflac remains in strong position among the two best insurance markets in the world. Even though the Japanese and the US insurance markets have many differences and couldn't be more geographically diverse, they both share a common basic human need for lifestyle protection no matter what the economic climate. They also share a common opportunity for growth. At the same time, our operations are performing well, and we have a strong balance sheet. Although we continue to face challenges, I have every confidence in the future of Aflac. Ken? Ken Janke Thank you, Dan. Before we get to your questions, let me take you briefly through some of our second quarter numbers, starting with the Aflac Japan segment. In terms of the top line in yen, revenues were up 2.5% in the quarter. Investment income was down slightly, 0.2%, due to the impact of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar denominated investment income. Excluding the effect of the stronger yen, investment income would have been up 2.3%. The annualized persistency rate excluding annuities for the first six months was 93.9%, which was unchanged from the first quarter of this year, however down from 94.5% in the first half of 2008. You'll recall from our discussions last year and earlier this year that we believe one of the influences on persistency is the large segment of the population reaching retirement age, which is a common lapsation point in Japan. In terms of the quarterly operating ratios, the benefit ratio continued to improve over last year. It was 60.4% in the quarter, down from 61.9% a year ago. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen on investment income, the benefit ratio was 60.1%. The expense ratio for the quarter was at 19.9%, which was unchanged from a year ago, and reflecting lower benefit ratio, the pretax margin expanded from 18.2% a year ago to 19.7% this year. Excluding the affect of currency, it would have been 20.0%. With the expansion of the profit margin, pretax earnings increased 10.7% for the quarter in yen terms and again, excluding the impact of the stronger yen, pretax operating earnings were up 13.1% in the quarter. During the quarter, we invested our cash flow in yen denominated securities at 3.14%. Including dollars, the blended rate was 3.34%. The portfolio yield on Aflac Japan's holdings at the end of June was 3.85%, which is down two basis points from the end of March, and 13 basis points lower than a year ago. Let me turn to Aflac US. Total revenues rose 2.7% in the quarter. As you heard, the annualized persistency rate for the six months was down from a year ago, but up versus the first quarter at 69.6%. The benefit ratio was 51.6%, compared with 52.8% a year ago. The decline in the benefit ratio reflected favorable claims trends on some product lines, as well as the affect of higher lapsation in the quarter compared with a year ago. The higher lapses compared with a year ago also increased DAC amortization, which was up 21% for the quarter. Increased DAC amortization was largely responsible for the increase in the operating expense ratio from 31.3% in 2008 to 32.3% in 2009 second quarter. However, the profit margin was 16.1%, up from 15.9% a year ago. As a result, pretax operating earnings rose 4% in the quarter. In terms of US investments, the new money yield for the quarter was 7.45% versus 7.29% a year ago. The yield on the portfolio at the end of June was 7.22%, which was up four basis points from the first quarter, and 18 basis points higher than a year ago. In terms of some other segments, the ratio of debt to total capital was 19% at the end of June, compared with 15.9% a year ago. That excludes the affect of FAS 115. Non-insurance interest expense in the quarter was $17 million compared with $6 million a year ago, largely reflecting the $850 million of debt that we issued earlier in the year. Parent company and other expenses were $6 million in the second quarter compared with $11 million a year ago. The pretax operating margins improved in the quarter, reflecting both better margins in the US and Japanese segment. The pretax margin rose from 17.2% to 18.2%, and on an after-tax basis, the margin increased from 11.2% to 12.0%. On an operating basis, the tax rate was 34.2%, down slightly from 34.7% in the second quarter of 2008. As you heard, operating earnings per diluted share were up 18.8% to $1.20, which was better than the guidance we had communicated on our first quarter call. The stronger yen increased operating earnings by $0.05 for the quarter, and $0.14 for the first half of this year. Excluding the yen's impact, operating earnings per diluted share increased 13.9% for the quarter and 14.6% for the first six months. Finally, let me comment on the outlook for operating earnings per share for this year. As Dan mentioned, our objective for 2009 is a 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. Assuming we produce a 13% increase at last year's average currency rate, we would expect to report $4.51 in operating earnings per diluted share for the full year of 2009. Although the yen has weakened a bit to the dollar since the end of the year, the average rate so far is still stronger than it was a year ago. Today, the yen has averaged approximately JPY95 to the dollar. If the yen averages JPY95 to JPY100 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the area of $4.59 to $4.73. Under that same currency scenario, we would expect operating earnings per diluted share to be in the area of $1.19 to $1.22. The last time I checked First Call, I believe the third quarter consensus estimate was $1.16 for the third quarter. Now, we'd be happy to take your questions. We do want to make sure everyone has an opportunity to ask a question. So please limit your questions to one if you can, so we can get to everybody. Don, now I'll turn it back to you."
